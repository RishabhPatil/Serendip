Make sure you run the webapp through Mozilla Firefox. Some of the graphs dont work in chrome.
Before you run the webapp server make sure you have these installed:
1) Python 3.6

2) Python libraries required for Webapp: re, numpy, flask, werkzeug and sklearn

3) Requirements for Data Preprocessing Code: jupyter notebook, gensim, nltk.
Make sure to download all the related data for nltk. You can do this by running the following code after you install the library:
> import nltk
> nltk.download('all')

4) Open the LDA.ipynb file via jupyter notebook.
Or you can view the results on our git repo: https://github.com/RishabhPatil/Serendip/blob/master/LDA.ipynb

5) Update the 'DATA_FOLDER' variable to selecte the dataset either 'data/NewsArticles/' or 'data/ReligiousTexts'

6) Run all the cells in sequence to generate the data.

7) Copy the generated files in 'data' folder to 'integration/static/data/'. This is where the webapp looks for the data files.

8) Run app.py from integration folder to run the webapp.
