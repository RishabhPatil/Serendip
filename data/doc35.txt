INTRODUCTION TO <span class="t24 hoverable">BOOK</span> I

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are in themselves exceedingly brief, less
than ten pages of large type in the original. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> they contain the
essence of practical wisdom, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in admirable <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> and detail.
The theme, if the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> interpreter be right, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> regeneration,
the birth of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> from the psychical man: the same theme
which Paul so wisely and eloquently <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in writing to his disciples
in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands.

We think of ourselves as living a purely physical life, in these material
bodies of ours. In reality, we have gone <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> from pure physical
life; for ages, our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> has been psychical, we have been centred and
immersed in the psychic nature. Some of the schools of India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that
the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is, as it were, a looking-glass, wherein are mirrored
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen by the physical eyes, and heard by the physical ears.
But this is a magic mirror; the images remain, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

these images, built on a measuring and comparing, on the massing of
images <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> into general ideas; on the abstraction of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> notions

desires and hates, ambition, envy, longing, speculation, curiosity,
self-will, self-interest.

The teaching of the East is, that all these are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> powers overlaid by

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

The purpose of life, therefore, is the realizing of that prophecy; the
unveiling of the immortal man; the birth of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> from the
psychical, whereby we enter our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inheritance and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to

Patanjali has in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, to be born from the psychical.
His purpose is, to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> the practical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> for the unveiling
and regeneration, and to indicate the fruit, the glory and the power, of
that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> birth.

Through the Sutras of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> book, Patanjali is concerned with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> problem, the emergence of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from the veils
and meshes of the psychic nature, the moods and vestures of the
mental and emotional man. Later will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the consideration of the

psychic veils and trammels, and a view of the realms in which these
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers are to be revealed.

At this point <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of explanation. I have been asked why
I use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Sutras, for these rules of Patanjali's system, when the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Aphorism has been connected with them in our minds for a
generation. The reason is this: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Aphorism suggests, to me at
least, a pithy sentence of very general application; a piece of
proverbial wisdom that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be quoted in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> sets of
circumstance, and which will almost bear on its face the evidence of
its truth. But with a Sutra the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> is different. It comes from the same
root as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "sew," and means, indeed, a thread, suggesting,
therefore, a close knit, consecutive chain of argument. Not only has
each Sutra a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the system, but further, taken out of this
place, it will be almost meaningless, and will by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> be
self-evident. So I have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> best to adhere to the original word.
The Sutras of Patanjali are as closely knit together, as dependent on
each other, as the propositions of Euclid, and can no more be taken
out of their proper setting.

In the second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> book, the problem of the emergence of
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is further dealt with. We are led to the consideration
of the barriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers,
and of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> steps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary
consciousness of practical life, to the finer, deeper, radiant
consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

1. OM: Here follows Instruction in Union.

Union, here as always in the Scriptures of India, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> union of the
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> with the Oversoul; of the personal consciousness with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Consciousness, whereby the mortal becomes immortal, and
enters the Eternal. Therefore, salvation is, first, freedom from sin and
the sorrow which comes from sin, and then a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and eternal
well-being, wherein the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> partakes of the being, the wisdom and
glory of God.

2. Union, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness, is gained through control of the
versatile psychic nature.

The goal is the full consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, illumined by the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Light. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> except the obdurate resistance of the psychic

powers run wild, perverted, drawn from their proper channel.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> task is, to regain control of this perverted nature,
to chasten, purify and restore the misplaced powers.

3. Then the Seer comes to consciousness in his proper nature.

Egotism is but the perversion of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> being. Ambition is the

mortal is the limitation of the immortal. When these false images <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>

when the clouds disperse.

4. Heretofore the Seer has been enmeshed in the activities of the
psychic nature.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which are the heritage of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> have
been caught and enmeshed in psychical activities. Instead of pure
being in the Divine, there has been fretful, combative, egotism, its

Instead of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of pure vision, there have
been restless senses nave been re and imaginings. Instead of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
joy, the undivided joy of pure being, there has been self-indulgence of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and mind. These are all real forces, but distorted from their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be extricated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> gems from the matrix,

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> powers are to be drawn <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from the psychic meshes.

5. The psychic activities are five; they are either subject or not subject
to the five hindrances (Book II, 3).

The psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is built up through the image-making power, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which lies behind and dwells in mind-pictures. These pictures
do not remain quiescent in the mind; they are kinetic, restless,
stimulating to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> acts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the mind-image of an indulgence
suggests and invites to a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> indulgence; the picture of past joy is
framed in regrets or hopes. And there is the ceaseless play of the
desire to know, to penetrate to the essence of things, to classify. This,
too, busies itself ceaselessly with the mind-images. So that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
classify the activities of the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> thus:

6. These activities are: Sound intellection, unsound intellection,
predication, sleep, memory.

We have here a list of mental and emotional powers; of powers that
picture and observe, and of powers that picture and feel. But the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> and feel is <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> and immortal. What is needed is,
not to destroy it, but to raise it from the psychical to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
realm.

7. The elements of sound intellection are: direct observation, inductive
reason, and trustworthy testimony.

Each of these is a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> power, thinly veiled. Direct observation is
the outermost <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the Soul's pure vision. Inductive reason rests on
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> principles of continuity and correspondence; and these, on
the supreme <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is of the One. Trustworthy testimony,
the sharing of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the wisdom of another, rests on the ultimate
oneness of all souls.

8. Unsound intellection is false understanding, not resting on a
perception of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of things.

When the object is not truly perceived, when the observation is
inaccurate and faulty, <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> or reasoning based on that mistaken
perception is of necessity false and unsound.

9. Predication is carried on through <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> or thoughts not resting on
an object perceived.

The purpose of this Sutra is, to distinguish between the mental process
of predication, and observation, induction or testimony. Predication
is the attribution of a quality or action to a subject, by adding to it a
predicate. In the sentence, "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is wise," "the man" is the subject;
"is wise" is the predicate. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be simply an interplay of thoughts,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the presence of the object <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of; or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be imaginary or unreal; while observation, induction and
testimony always go back to an object.

10. Sleep is the psychic condition which rests on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> states, all
material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> being absent.

In waking life, we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> currents of perception; an outer current
of physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen and heard and perceived; an inner current of
mind-images and thoughts. The outer current ceases in sleep; the inner
current continues, and watching the mind-images float before the field
of consciousness, we "dream."  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> when there are no dreams, there is
still a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> consciousness in sleep, so that, on waking, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> says, "I
have slept well," or "I have slept badly."

11. Memory is holding to mind-images of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> perceived, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
modifying them.

Here, as before, the mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is explained in terms of
mind-images, which are the material of which the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is
built, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the sages teach that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of our perception,
which is <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of mind-images, is but the wraith or shadow
of the real and everlasting world. In this sense, memory is but the
psychical inversion of the spiritual, ever-present vision. That which is
ever before the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> eye of the Seer needs not to be remembered.

12. The control of these psychic activities comes through the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> use
of the will, and through ceasing from self-indulgence.

If these psychical powers and energies, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as
passion and hate and fear, are but <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers fallen and
perverted, how are we to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> about their release and restoration?
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> are presented to us: the awakening of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> will,
and the purification of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and thought.

13. The <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> use of the will is the steady, effort to stand in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
being.

We have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of ourselves, perhaps, as creatures moving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this
earth, rather helpless, at the mercy of storm and hunger and our
enemies. We are to think of ourselves as immortals, dwelling in the
Light, encompassed and sustained by <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers. The steady
effort to hold this <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> will awaken dormant and unrealized
powers, which will unveil to us the nearness of the Eternal.

14. This becomes a firm resting-place, when followed long,
persistently, with earnestness.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> seek <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in conformity with the laws of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life,
with earnestness, humility, gentle charity, which is an acknowledgment
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> us all. Only through obedience to that shared
Life, through perpetual remembrance of our oneness with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Being, our nothingness apart from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Being, can we enter our
inheritance.

15. Ceasing from self-indulgence is conscious mastery over the thirst
for sensuous pleasure here or hereafter.

Rightly understood, the desire for sensation is the desire of being, the
distortion of the soul's eternal life. The lust of sensual stimulus and
excitation rests on the longing to feel one's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> keenly, to gain the
<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of being really alive. This <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> comes only with the
coming of the soul, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> comes only in silence, after
self-indulgence has been courageously and loyally stilled, through
reverence before the coming soul.

16. The consummation of this is freedom from thirst for any mode of
psychical activity, through the establishment of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to gain a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> understanding of this teaching, study <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be
supplemented by devoted practice, faith by works. The reading of the

and this, attained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a small degree, will help us notably in our
contest. To him that hath, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be given.

17. Meditation with an object follows these stages: first, exterior
examining, then interior judicial action, then joy, then realization of
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> being.

In the practice of meditation, a beginning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by fixing the
attention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> some external object, such as a sacred image or
picture, or a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of devotion. In the second stage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
passes from the outer object to an inner pondering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its lessons.
The third stage is the inspiration, the heightening of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> will,
which results from this pondering. The fourth stage is the realization
of one's <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> being, as enkindled by this meditation.

18. After the exercise of the will has stilled the psychic activities,
meditation rests only on the fruit of former meditations.

In virtue of continued practice and effort, the need of an external
object on which to rest the meditation is outgrown. An interior state
of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness is reached, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "the cloud of

19. Subjective consciousness arising from a natural <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> is possessed
by those who have laid aside their bodies and been absorbed into
subjective nature.

Those who have died, entered the paradise between births, are in a
condition resembling meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> an external object. But in the
fullness of time, the seeds of desire in them will spring up, and they
will be born again into this world.

20. For the others, there is <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness, led up to by faith,
valour <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception.

It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> to keep in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> these steps on the path to illumination: faith,
valour, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception. Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can

valour; from valour, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> mindfulness; from <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> mindfulness, a
one-pointed aspiration toward the soul; from this, perception; and
finally, full vision as the soul.

21. <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> consciousness is nearest to those of keen, intense will.

The image used is the swift impetus of the torrent; the kingdom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
be taken by force. Firm will comes only through effort; effort is
inspired by faith. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> secret is this: it is not enough to have
intuitions; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> act on them; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> live them.

22. The will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be weak, or of middle strength, or intense.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> there is a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than this. For those
of weak will, there is this counsel: to be faithful in obedience, to live
the life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to strengthen the will to more perfect obedience. The
will is not ours, but God's, and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into it only through
obedience. As we enter into the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of God, we are permitted to
share the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God.

 <span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span> than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> is the goal, the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the

Master.

If we think of our lives as tasks laid on us by the Master of Life, if we
look on all duties as parts of that Master's work, entrusted to us, and
forming our life-work; then, if we obey, promptly, loyally, sincerely,
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> enter by degrees into the Master's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and share the Master's

24. The Master is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, who is free from hindrances,
bondage to works, and the fruition and seed of works.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> of the Master, the Lord, is of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in

through our former works, we are under the dominance of sorrow.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> of the Master is free from sin and servitude and sorrow.

25. In the Master is the perfect seed of Omniscience.

the Oversoul are One.

26. He is the Teacher of all who have gone before, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> he is not
limited by Time.

From the beginning, the Oversoul has been the Teacher of all souls,
which, by their entrance into the Oversoul, by realizing their oneness
with the Oversoul, have inherited the kingdom of the Light. For the
Oversoul is before Time, and Time, <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of all else, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of His

of the barriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers,
and of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> steps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary
consciousness of practical life, to the finer, deeper, radiant
consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

30. The barriers to interior consciousness, which drive the psychic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and that, are these: sickness, inertia, doubt,
lightmindedness, laziness, intemperance, false notions, inability to
reach a stage of meditation, or to hold it when reached.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> remember that we are considering the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as
enwrapped and enmeshed by the psychic nature, the emotional and

personality. Nine of these are enumerated, and they go pretty
thoroughly into the brute toughness of the psychic nature.

Sickness is included rather for its effect on the emotions and mind,
<span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> bodily infirmity, such as blindness or deafness, is no insuperable
barrier to <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> sometimes be a help, as cutting off
distractions. It will be <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> for us to ponder over each of these nine
activities, thinking of each as a psychic state, a barrier to the interior
consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

31. Grieving, despondency, bodily restlessness, the drawing in and
sending <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> of the life-breath <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> contribute to drive the psychic

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> moods are easily understood. We can <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> bow a
sodden psychic condition, flagrantly opposed to the pure and positive
joy of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a barrier. The next, bodily restlessness,
is in a special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the fault of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and generation. When it is
conquered, mental restlessness will be half conquered, too.

The next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> terms, concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> breath, offer some difficulty.
The surface <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is harsh and irregular breathing; the deeper
<span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of harsh and irregular impulses.

32. Steady application to a principle is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> a stop to these.

The will, which, in its pristine state, was full of vigour, has been
steadily corrupted by self-indulgence, the seeking of moods and
sensations for sensation's sake. Hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> all the morbid and sickly
moods of the mind. The remedy is a return to the pristine state of the
will, by vigorous, positive effort; or, as we are here told, by steady
application to a principle. The principle to which we should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
steadily apply ourselves should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> arising from the reality of
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life; valorous <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for the soul, in <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> as in ourselves.

33. By sympathy with the happy, compassion for the sorrowful,
delight in the holy, disregard of the unholy, the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> moves
to gracious peace.

When we are wrapped up in ourselves, shrouded with the cloak of our
egotism, absorbed in our pains and bitter thoughts, we are not willing
to disturb or strain our own sickly mood by giving kindly sympathy to
the happy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> doubling their joy, or by showing compassion for the
sad, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> halving their sorrow. We refuse to find delight in <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> things,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> brood in sad pessimism on unholy things. All these
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> psychic moods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be conquered by strong effort of will. This
rending of the veils will reveal to us something of the grace and peace
which are of the interior consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

34. Or peace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be reached by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> sending <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> and control
of the life-breath.

Here again we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> look for a double meaning: first, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> and
quiet breathing which is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the victory over bodily restlessness;
then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> and quiet tenor of life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> harsh or dissonant
impulses, which brings stillness to the heart.

35. Faithful, persistent application to any object, if completely
attained, will bind the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> to steadiness.

We are still considering how to overcome the wavering and
perturbation of the psychic nature, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it quite unfit to
transmit the inward consciousness and stillness. We are once more
told to use the will, and to train it by steady and persistent work: by
"sitting close" to our work, in the phrase of the original.

36. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> will a joyful, radiant spirit.

There is no such illusion as gloomy pessimism, and it has been truly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that a man's cheerfulness is the measure of his faith. Gloom,
despondency, the pale cast of thought, are very amenable to the will.
Sturdy and courageous effort will <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> a clear and valorous mind.
But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> always be remembered that this is not for solace to the
personal man, but is rather an offering to the ideal of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, a
contribution to the universal and universally shared treasure in heaven.

37. Or the purging of self-indulgence from the psychic nature.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> recognize that the fall of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is a reality, exemplified in our
own persons. We have quite other sins than the animals, and <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more
deleterious; and they have all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> through self-indulgence, with
which our psychic natures are soaked through and through. As we
climbed down hill for our pleasure, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> we climb up again for our
purification and restoration to our former high estate. The process is
painful, perhaps, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> indispensable.

38. Or a pondering on the perceptions gained in dreams and dreamless
sleep.

For the Eastern sages, dreams are, it is true, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up of images of
waking life, reflections of what the eyes have seen and the ears heard.
But dreams are something more, for the images are in a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> real,
objective on their own plane; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that there is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span>

Here is a <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> which our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is beginning to grasp: that <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span>

Newton was asked how he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> his discoveries. By intending my

This steady pressure, this becoming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

41. When the perturbations of the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> have all been stilled,
then the consciousness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a pure crystal, takes the colour of what it
rests on, whether that be the perceiver, perceiving, or the <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span>
perceived.

This is a fuller expression of the last Sutra, and is so lucid that
comment can hardly add to it. Everything is either perceiver,
perceiving, or the <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> perceived; or, as we <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> say, consciousness,
force, or matter. The sage tells us that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> key will unlock the
secrets of all three, the secrets of consciousness, force and matter
alike. The <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> is, that the cordial sympathy of a gentle heart,
intuitively understanding the hearts of others, is really a manifestation
of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> as that penetrating perception whereby <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> divines
the secrets of planetary motions or atomic structure.

42. When the consciousness, poised in perceiving, blends <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> the
name, the object dwelt on and the idea, this is perception with exterior
consideration.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage of the consideration of an external object, the
perceiving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> comes to it, preoccupied by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> and idea
conventionally associated with that object. For example, in coming to
the study of a book, we think of the author, his period, the school to
which he belongs. The second stage, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in the next Sutra, goes
directly to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the book, setting its traditional
trappings aside and finding its application to our own experience and
problems.

The commentator takes a very simple illustration: a cow, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
considers, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the cow, the animal itself and
the idea of a cow in the mind. In the second stage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> pushes these
trappings aside and, entering into the inmost being of the cow, shares
its consciousness, as do some of the artists who paint cows. They get
at the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of what they study and paint.

43. When the object dwells in the mind, clear of memory-pictures,
uncoloured by the mind, as a pure luminous idea, this is perception
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exterior or consideration.

We are still considering external, visible objects. Such perception as
is here described is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that penetrating vision whereby

whereby a really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> portrait painter pierces to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him whom
he paints, and makes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> live on canvas. These stages of
perception are described in this way, to lead the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> up to an
understanding of the piercing soul-vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, the
immortal.

44. The same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> steps, when referring to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of finer substance,

We now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to mental or psychical objects: to images in the mind.
It is precisely by comparing, arranging and superposing these
mind-images that we get our general notions or concepts. This
process of analysis and synthesis, whereby we select <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> qualities
in a group of mind-images, and then range <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> those of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>

nearer to the keen vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

45. Subtle substance rises in ascending degrees, to that pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
which has no distinguishing mark.

As we ascend from outer material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are permeated by
separateness, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> chief characteristic is to be separate, just as
so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> pebbles are separate from each other; as we ascend, first, to
mind-images, which overlap and coalesce in both space and time, and
then to ideas and principles, we finally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to purer essences,
drawing ever nearer and nearer to unity.

Or we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> illustrate this principle thus. Our bodily, external selves are
quite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our
mental selves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> again,

46. The above are the degrees of limited and conditioned <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
consciousness, still containing the seed of separateness.

In the four stages of perception above described, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision
is still working through the mental and psychical, the inner genius is
still expressed through the outer, personal man. The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> completely to consciousness as himself, in his own realm,
the psychical veils laid aside.

47. When pure perception <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> judicial action of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is
reached, there follows the gracious peace of the inner self.

We have instanced <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> types of this pure perception: the poet's
divination, whereby he sees the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the symbol, likeness in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> unlike, and beauty in all things; the pure insight of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
philosopher, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> vision rests not on the appearances of life, but on
its realities; or the saint's firm perception of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and being.
All these are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> advanced on the way; they have drawn near to the secret
dwelling of peace.

48. In that peace, perception is unfailingly true.

The poet, the wise philosopher and the saint not only reach a wide and
luminous consciousness, but they gain <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
substantial reality. When we know, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that we know. For we
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to the stage where we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> by being them, and
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> can be more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> than being. We rest on the rock, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span>
it to be rock, rooted in the very <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of the world.

49. The object of this perception is other than what is learned from the
sacred books, or by sound inference, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> this perception is
particular.

The distinction is a luminous and inspiring one. The Scriptures teach
general truths, concerning universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and broad laws, and
inference from their teaching is not less general. But the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
perception of the awakened Seer brings particular <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> concerning his
own particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and needs, whether these be for himself or others.
He receives defined, precise knowledge, exactly applying to what he
has at heart.

50. The impress on the consciousness springing from this perception
supersedes all previous impressions.

Each state or field of the mind, each field of knowledge, so to speak,
which is reached by mental and emotional energies, is a psychical
state, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> picture of a stage with the actors on it, is a
psychical state or field. When the pure vision, as of the poet, the
philosopher, the saint, fills the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> field, all lesser views and visions
are crowded out. This high consciousness displaces all lesser
consciousness. Yet, in a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sense, that which is viewed as part,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by the vision of a sage, has still an element of illusion, a thin
psychical veil, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> pure and luminous that veil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be. It is the
last and <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> psychic state.

51. When this impression ceases, then, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> all impressions have
ceased, there arises pure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness, with no seed of
separateness left.

The last psychic veil is drawn aside, and the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands with
unveiled vision, pure serene.

The second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the second <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> is concerned with practical
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> training, that is, with the earlier practical training of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

The most striking <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> in it is the emphasis laid on the
Commandments, which are precisely those of the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the

growth on some other foundation, on the foundation, for example, of
intellectual curiosity or psychical selfishness. In reality, on this latter

It is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

therefore, as our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> practice, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
growth, that fiery quality of the will which enkindles and illumines,
and, at the same time, the steady practice of purification, the burning
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> of all <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> impurities. <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> reading is so universally
accepted and understood, that it needs no comment. The very study
of Patanjali's Sutras is an exercise in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading, and a very
effective one. And so with all other books of the Soul. Obedience to
the Master means, that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the will of the Master our will,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> confirm in all wave to the will of the Divine, setting aside the
wills of self, which are but psychic distortions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Will.
The constant effort to obey in all the ways we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> and understand,
will reveal <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> ways and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> tasks, the evidence of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> growth of
the Soul. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> will do more for the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in us than this, for
there is no such regenerating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> as the awakening <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> will.

2. Their aim is, to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> soul-vision, and to wear <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> hindrances.

The aim of fervour, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading and obedience to the Master, is,
to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> soulvision, and to wear <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> hindrances. Or, to use the
phrase we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to open his eyes; to help him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to throw aside the
veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him,
tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes. And this, as all
teachers testify, is a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight,
demanding fine courage and persistent toil. Fervour, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> will, is, as we said, two-fold: it illumines, and so helps the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to see; and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> burns up the nets and meshes which
ensnare the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. So with the other means, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading
and obedience. Each, in its action, is two-fold, wearing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the
psychical, and upbuilding the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

3. These are the hindrances: the darkness of unwisdom, self-assertion,
lust hate, attachment.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man. The darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of
the psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and
fears, plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to
see, or refuses to see, that there is a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man; and so doggedly
resists all efforts of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to cast off his psychic tyrant and
<span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> himself free. This is the real darkness; and all those who deny the
immortality of the soul, or deny the soul's existence, and so lay out
their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and his ambitions, are
under this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of darkness. Born of this darkness, this psychic
self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself
alone; and this conviction, when <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> into practice in our life, leads to
contest with other personalities, and so to hate. This hate, again,
makes against the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> it hinders the revelation of the
high harmony between the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and his other selves, a
harmony to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect
<span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> which casts out fear.

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of
sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, as,
in Shakespeare's phrase, the cackling geese <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> drown the song of
the nightingale. And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness,
coming from the failure to find strength in the primal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

Attachment is but <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for psychic self-absorption; for we are
absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> our
minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over
them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner' the
enmeshed and fettered <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

4. The darkness of unwisdom is the field of the others. These
hindrances <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded.

Here we have really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sutras in one. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> has been explained
already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust,
attachment. They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the
psychical self.

Next, we are told that these barriers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be either dormant, or
suspended, or expanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will
be <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of
strong aspiration. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> expanded, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be fought and conquered,
or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be worn thin,-as a veil might,
or the links of manacles.

5 The darkness of ignorance is: holding that which is unenduring,
impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the
Soul.

This we have really considered already. The psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness
of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical,
personal man, to the exclusion of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. It is the belief,
carried into action, that the personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is the real man, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> for
whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should
live. This is that psychical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of whom it is said: he that soweth to
the flesh, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> of the flesh reap corruption.

6. Self-assertion comes from thinking of the Seer and the instrument
of vision as forming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> self.

This is the fundamental idea of the Sankhya philosophy, of which the
Yoga is avowedly the practical side. To translate this into our terms,
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the Seer is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man; the instrument of vision
is the psychical man, through which the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> gains experience
of the outer world. But we turn the servant into the master. We
attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which really
belongs to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> alone; and so, thinking of the quality of
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as belonging to the psychical, we merge the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the psychical; or, as the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says, we think of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> as
forming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> self.

7. Lust is the resting in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of enjoyment.

This has been explained again and again. Sensation, as, for example,
the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the
choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and
hurtful things. But if we rest in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of taste, as a pleasure in
itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into
gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live. So with the other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> organic power, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of reproduction. This lust comes into
being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from
that.

8. Hate is the resting in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of pain.

Pain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the
jarring discords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself
supreme. A dwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring
selves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> further asunder, and puts <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> enmity between them, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
hindering the harmony of the Real, the reconciliation through the
Soul.

9. Attachment is the desire toward life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the wise, carried
forward by its own energy.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
the psychical self. This prevails <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in those who have attained <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
wisdom, so <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as it falls short of the wisdom of complete
renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man, and of the Master who guards and aids the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

The desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself,
carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the
circle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and rebirth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and rebirth, instead of the liberation
of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

10. These hindrances, when they have <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> subtle, are to be
removed by a countercurrent.

The darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of wisdom,
pursued through fervour, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading of <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> teachings and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
itself, and by obedience to the Master.

Lust is to be removed by pure aspiration of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, which,
bringing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> strength and stability, takes <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the void of weakness
which we try to fill by the stimulus of sensations.

Hate is to be overcome by love. The fear that arises through the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of separate, warring selves is to be stilled by the realization of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span>
Self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in all. This realization is the perfect <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> that casts
out fear.

The hindrances are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> subtle when, by initial efforts,
they have been located and recognized in the psychic nature.

11. Their active turnings are to be removed by meditation.

Here is, in truth, the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> secret of Yoga, the science of the soul.
The active turnings, the strident vibrations, of selfishness, lust and hate
are to be stilled by meditation, by letting <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> dwell in
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, by lifting up the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> to the strong, silent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> above,
which rests in the stillness of eternal love, and needs no harsh
vibration to convince it of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> being.

12. The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in these hindrances.
It will be felt in this life, or in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> manifested.

The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in the darkness of
unwisdom, in selfishness, in lust, in hate, in attachment to sensation.
All these are, in the last analysis, absorption in the psychical self; and
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> sorrow, because it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of separateness, and
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> jarring discord and inevitable death. But the psychical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span>
will breed a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> psychical self, in a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> birth, and so <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> sorrows in
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> manifest.

13. From this root there grow and ripen the fruits of birth, of the
life-span, of all that is tasted in life.

Fully to comment on this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be to write a treatise on Karma and
its practical working in detail, whereby the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the next
birth, its content and duration, are determined; and to do this the
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> commentator is in no wise fitted. But this <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> is clearly
understood: that, through a kind of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> gravitation, the
incarnating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> is drawn to a home and life-circle which will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> it
scope and discipline; and its need of discipline is clearly conditioned
by its character, its standing, its accomplishment.

14. These bear fruits of rejoicing, or of affliction, as they are sprung
from <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> or unholy works.

<span class="t6 hoverable">Since</span> holiness is obedience to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> law, to the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
harmony, and obedience to harmony strengthens that harmony in the
soul, which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> joy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> joy comes of holiness:
comes, indeed, in no other way. And as unholiness is disobedience,

two-fold <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> is true, whether the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> effect in this, or in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
unmanifested birth.

15. To him who possesses discernment, all personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is misery,
because it ever waxes and wanes, is ever afflicted with restlessness,

wanes; because birth brings inevitable death; because there is no

misery, because it is afflicted with restlessness; so that he who has
much, finds not satisfaction, but rather the whetted hunger for more.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> is not quenched by pouring oil on it; so desire is not quenched
by the satisfaction of desire. Again, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> is

because a desire satisfied is but the seed from which springs the desire
to find <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> satisfaction again. The appetite comes in eating, as the
proverb says, and grows by what it feeds on. And the psychic self,
torn with conflicting desires, is ever the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> divided against itself,

16. This pain is to be warded off, before it has come.

In other words, we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> cure the pains of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by laying on them any
balm. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> cut the root, absorption in the psychical self. So it is
said, there is no cure for the misery of longing, but to fix the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the eternal.

17. The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of what is to be warded off, is the absorption of the
Seer in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen.

Here again we have the fundamental idea of the Sankhya, which is the
intellectual counterpart of the Yoga system. The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of what is to
be warded off, the root of misery, is the absorption of consciousness
in the psychical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which beguile the psychical man.
The cure is liberation.

18. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> seen have as their property manifestation, action, inertia.

Here is a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> philosophy of life. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> seen, the total of the

illumination are. The commentator <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> describes them:

First, the danger to be escaped is recognized; it need not be
recognized a second time. Second, the causes of the danger to be
escaped are worn away; they need not be worn <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> a second time.
Third, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of escape is clearly perceived, by the contemplation
which checks psychic perturbation. Fourth, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of escape, clear
discernment, has been developed. This is the fourfold release
belonging to insight. The final release from the psychic is three-fold:
As fifth of the seven degrees, the dominance of its thinking is ended;
as sixth, its potencies, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> rocks from a precipice, fall of themselves;
once dissolved, they do not grow again. Then, as seventh, freed from
these potencies, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as
purity and light. Happy is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who beholds this
seven-fold illumination in its ascending stages.

28. From steadfastly following after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of Yoga, until impurity
is worn away, there comes the illumination of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> up to full
discernment.

Here, we enter on the more detailed practical teaching of Patanjali,
with its sound and luminous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sense. And when we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to detail
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of Yoga, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> be astonished at their simplicity.
There is little in them that is mysterious. They are very familiar. The
essence of the matter lies in carrying them out.

29. The eight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of Yoga are: the Commandments, the Rules,
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> Poise, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> Control of the life-force, Withdrawal, Attention,
Meditation, Contemplation.

These eight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> are to be followed in their order, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> which
will immediately be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> clear. We can get a ready understanding of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> by comparing them with the Commandments which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
be obeyed by all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> citizens, and the Rules which are laid on the
members of religious orders. Until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> has fulfilled the first, it is
futile to concern oneself with the second. And so with all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of
Yoga. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be taken in their order.

30. The Commandments are these: nom injury, truthfulness, abstaining
from stealing, from impurity, from covetousness.

These five precepts are almost exactly the same as the Buddhist
Commandments: not to kill, not to steal, not to be guilty of
incontinence, not to drink intoxicants, to speak the truth. Almost
identical is St. Paul's list: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t9 t15 t16 t20 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">shalt</span> not commit adultery, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t9 t15 t16 t20 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">shalt</span>

And in the same

the Commandments.

This broad, general training, which forms and develops <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>

there can be <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> hope of success in the further stages of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>

angel. On this broad, humane and wise foundation does the system of
Patanjali rest.

31. The Commandments, not limited to any race, place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or

The Commandments <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> the broad general training of humanity.
Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them rests on a universal, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> law. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them

and being of the Eternal, thereby bringing ourselves to inevitable con

So the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> steps in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be taken by bringing

32. The Rules are these: purity, serenity fervent aspiration, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
reading, and per feet obedience to the Master.

Here we have a finer law, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which humanity as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> is less ready

essence as the Commandments, but on a higher, more <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> plane.
The Commandments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be obeyed in outer acts and abstinences; the
Rules demand obedience of the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and spirit, a <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more awakened
and more positive consciousness. The Rules are the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
counterpart of the Commandments, and they have finer degrees, for
more advanced <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth.

33. When transgressions hinder, the weight of the imagination should
be thrown' on the opposite side.

we imagine that, after he has built well, and his possessions have
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> dear to him, he himself is robbed, then we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how he

Our sorrows and losses teach us the

Now as to the more direct application. To conquer a sin, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and

34. Transgressions are injury, falsehood, theft, incontinence, envy;

35. Where non-injury is perfected, all enmity ceases in the presence of

37. Where cessation from theft is perfected, all treasures <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span>

The creative power, strong and full of vigour, is no longer dissipated,

39. Where there is firm conquest of covetousness, he who has
conquered it awakes to the how and why of life.

So it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that, before we can understand the laws of Karma, we

40. Through purity a withdrawal from one's own bodily life, a ceasing

this outer, manifested, fugitive life, whether of ourselves or of others,
loses something of its charm and glamour, and we seek rather the

44. Through <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading, the disciple gains communion with the

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> reading meant, for ancient India, something more than it does
with us. It meant, first, the recital of sacred texts, which, in their very
sounds, had mystical potencies; and it meant a recital of texts which
were divinely emanated, and held in themselves the living, potent
essence of the divine.

For us, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> reading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> a communing with the recorded

peace comes light. Soul-vision is perfected through obedience.

46. <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">Right</span> poise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be firm and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> strain. Here we approach a
section of the teaching which has manifestly a two-fold meaning. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is physical, and concerns the bodily position of the student, and

body. The <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> sentence declares that, for <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and for meditation,
the position of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be steady and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> strain, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span>
that the finer currents of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> run their course.

It applies further to the poise of the soul, that fine balance and
stability which <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> can shake, where the consciousness rests on the
firm foundation of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> being. This is <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a
rock, which the winds and waves beat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> in vain.

47. <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">Right</span> poise is to be gained by steady and temperate effort, and by
setting the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the everlasting.

Here again, there is the two-fold meaning, for physical poise is to be

by setting the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> on the Eternal, filling the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> with the atmosphere

and steadfastly on his feet.

48 The fruit of <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> poise is the strength to resist the shocks of
infatuation or sorrow.

In the simpler physical sense, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> coveted by the wording of
the original, this sentence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that wise effort establishes such
bodily poise that the accidents of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> disturb it, as the captain
remains steady, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> disaster overtake his ship.

But the deeper <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more important. The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, too,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> learn to withstand all shocks, to remain steadfast through the
perturbations of external <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and the storms and whirlwinds of the
psychical world. This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which is gained by wise,
continuous effort, and by filling the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the atmosphere of the
Eternal.

49. When this is gained, there follows the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> guidance of the
life-currents, the control of the incoming and outgoing breath.

It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> understood to-day that most of our maladies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from
impure conditions of the blood. It is coming to be understood that
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> breathing, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> oxygenation, will do very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to keep the
blood clean and pure. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> a <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of breathing is a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the science of life.

But the deeper <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is, that the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, when he has gained
poise through <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> effort and aspiration, can stand firm, and guide the
currents of his life, both the incoming current of events, and the
outgoing current of his acts.

Exactly the same symbolism is used in the saying: Not that which
goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the
mouth, this defileth a man.... Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which proceed out of the
mouth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> ... out of the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> proceed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
thoughts, murders, uncleanness, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step in purification is to keep the Commandments.

50. The life-current is either outward, or inward, or balanced; it is
regulated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to place, time, number; it is prolonged and subtle.
The technical, physical side of this has its value. In the breath, there
should be <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> inbreathing, followed by the period of pause, when the
air comes into contact with the blood, and this again followed by <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
outbreathing, even, steady, silent. Further, the lungs should be evenly
filled; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> maladies <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> arise from the neglect and consequent
weakening of some region of the lungs. And the number of breaths is
so important, so closely related to health, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> nurse's chart
records it.

But the deeper <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is concerned with the currents of life; with
that which goeth into and cometh out of the heart.

51. The fourth degree transcends external and internal objects.

The inner <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> seems to be that, in addition to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees
of control already described, control, that is, over the incoming
current of life, over the outgoing current, and over the condition of
pause or quiesence, there is a fourth degree of control, which holds in
complete mastery both the outer passage of events and the inner
currents of thoughts and emotions; a condition of perfect poise and
stability in the midst of the flux of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> outward and inward.

52. Thereby is worn <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the veil which covers up the light.

The veil is the psychic nature, the web of emotions, desires,
argumentative trains of thought, which cover up and obscure the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span>
by absorbing the entire attention and keeping the consciousness in the
psychic realm. When hopes and fears are reckoned at their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> worth,
in comparison with lasting possessions of the Soul; when the outer
reflections of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have ceased to distract us from inner realities;
when argumentative-thought no longer entangles us, but yields its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to flashing intuition, the certainty which springs from within;
then is the veil worn away, the consciousness is drawn from the
psychical to the spiritual, from the temporal to the Eternal. Then is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> unveiled.

53. Thence comes the mind's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to hold itself in the light.

It has been <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> said, that what we most need is the faculty of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
attention; and in the same direction of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it has been eloquently
declared that prayer does not consist in our catching God's attention,
but rather in our allowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to hold our attention.

The vital matter is, that we need to disentangle our consciousness
from the noisy and perturbed thraldom of the psychical, and to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>
to consciousness as the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. This we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> do, first, by
purification, through the Commandments and the Rules; and, second,
through the faculty of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> attention, by steadily heeding endless
fine intimations of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> us, and by intending our
consciousness thereto; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> by degrees transferring the centre of
consciousness from the psychical to the spiritual. It is a question, first,
of love, and then of attention.

54. The <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> Withdrawal is the disengaging of the powers from
entanglement in outer things, as the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has been
withdrawn and stilled.

To understand this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us reverse the process, and think of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
consciousness, centred in the Soul, gradually expanding and taking on
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> perceptive powers; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> will, at the same
time, differentiating itself into the varied powers of action.

Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us imagine this to be reversed, so that the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> force,
which has gone into the differentiated powers, is once more gathered
<span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> into the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of intuition and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> will, taking on
that unity which is the hall-mark of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> things, as diversity is the
seal of material things.

It is all a matter of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> for the quality of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness, as
against psychical consciousness, of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> and attention. For where the
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is, there will the treasure be also; where the consciousness is,
there will the vesture with its powers be developed.

55. Thereupon follows perfect mastery over the powers.

When the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> condition which we have described is reached, with
its purity, poise, and illuminated vision, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is coming
into his inheritance, and gaining complete mastery of his powers.

Indeed, <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the struggle to keep the Commandments and the
Rules has been paving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for this mastery; through this very
struggle and sacrifice the mastery has <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> possible; just as, to use
St. Paul's simile, the athlete gains the mastery in the contest and the
race through the sacrifice of his <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and arduous training. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he
gains the crown.

considering these <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be understood and
kept in memory. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of these is this: These <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers can
only be gained when the development described in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and second
books has been measurably attained; when the Commandments have
been kept, the Rules faithfully followed, and the experiences which are
described have been passed through. For only after this is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> grown, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> disentangled from the psychical bandages
and veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can use his
proper powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
powers: they are in no <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> an abnormal or supernatural overgrowth
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the material man, but are rather the powers and faculties inherent
in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, entirely natural to him, and coming naturally into
activity, as the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is disentangled and liberated from
psychical bondage, through keeping the Commandments and Rules
already <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> forth.

As the personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is the limitation and inversion of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man, all his faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. In a single phrase, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> seeking is the inversion of the
Self-seeking which is the very being of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man: the ceaseless
search after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and august <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> of all beings. This inversion is
corrected by keeping the Commandments and Rules, and gradually,
as the inversion is overcome, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is extricated, and
comes into possession and free exercise of his powers. The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and liberated <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man. They can only be developed and used as the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> grows
and attains liberation through obedience. This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> to be
kept in mind, in all that is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers in the third and
fourth books of the Sutras. The second <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> to be understood and
kept in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is this:

Just as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is
ultimately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and eternal, definitely related throughout the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
wide universe; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and eternal, so coordinated throughout the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> universe that
whatever affects any atom measurably affects the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> boundless
realm of matter and force, to the most distant star or nebula on the
dim confines of space; so the ancient sages had discerned and taught
that all consciousness is one, immortal, indivisible, infinite; so finely
correlated and continuous that whatever is perceived by any
consciousness is, whether actually or potentially, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the reach of
all consciousness, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the reach of any consciousness.
This has been <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> expressed by <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> that all souls are fundamentally

of psychic bonds and veils, when the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is able to stand, to
see, then this superb <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> comes into effect: whatever is <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the

universe, is <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> his reach, and may, if he wills, be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of his

I read the page of a <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> while inking of something else. At the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span>

attention, the intending of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> on each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and line of the page,
just as the eyes are focussed on each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and line, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> here
contemplated. It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to focus the consciousness on a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
spot, and hold it there Attention is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and indispensable step in

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> knowledge.

2. A prolonged holding of the perceiving consciousness in that region
is meditation (dhyana).

This will apply equally to outer and inner things. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> for a moment
fix my attention on some visible object, in a single penetrating glance,
or I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> hold the attention fixedly on it until it reveals <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more of its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> than a single glance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> perceive. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is the focussing
of the searchlight of consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the object. The other is the
holding of the white beam of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> steadily and persistently on the
object, until it yields up the secret of its details. So for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> within;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> fix the inner glance for a moment on <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> things, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> hold the consciousness steadily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them, until what was in the
dark slowly comes <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> into the light, and yields up its immortal
secret. But this is possible only for the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, after the
Commandments and the Rules have been kept; for until this is done,
the thronging storms of psychical thoughts dissipate and distract the
attention, so that it will not remain fixed on <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> things. The cares
of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, choke the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> message.

3. When the perceiving consciousness in this meditative is wholly
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to illuminating the essential <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the object contemplated,
and is freed from the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of separateness and personality, this is
contemplation (samadhi).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us review the steps so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> taken. First, the beam of perceiving
consciousness is focussed on a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> region or subject, through the
effort of attention. Then this attending consciousness is held on its
object. Third, there is the ardent will to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> its meaning, to illumine
it with comprehending thought. Fourth, all personal bias--all desire
merely to indorse a previous opinion and so prove oneself right, and
all desire for personal profit or gratification <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be quite <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> away.
There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be a purely disinterested <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> for its own sake.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> is the perceiving consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> void, as it were, of all
personality or <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of separateness. The personal limitation stands
aside and lets the All-consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to bear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the problem.
The Oversoul bends its ray <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the object, and illumines it with pure
light.

4. When these three, Attention, Meditation Contemplation, are
exercised at once, this is perfectly concentrated Meditation (sanyama).

When the personal limitation of the perceiving consciousness stands
aside, and allows the All-conscious to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to bear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the problem,
then arises that real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a flash of genius; that
real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which makes discoveries, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which no
discovery can be made, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> painstaking the effort. For genius is
the vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, and that vision is a question of growth
rather than <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> effort; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> effort, rightly continued, will

Through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> aside personal limitation, to push aside petty concerns and

and desire to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> it; through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for the
All-consciousness, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> their discoveries. Newton,
watching the apple fall to the earth, was able to look beyond, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
the subtle waves of force pulsating through apples and worlds and
suns and galaxies, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to perceive universal gravitation. The
Oversoul, looking through his eyes, recognized the universal force,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of its own children. Darwin, watching the forms and motions of
plants and animals, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the same august consciousness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to bear on
them, and saw infinite growth perfected through ceaseless struggle.
He perceived the superb process of evolution, the Oversoul once more
recognizing its own. Fraunhofer, noting the dark lines in the band of
sunlight in his spectroscope, divined their identity with the bright lines
in the spectra of incandescent iron, sodium and the rest, and so saw
the oneness of substance in the worlds and suns, the unity of the
materials of the universe. Once again the Oversoul, looking with his
eyes, recognized its own. So it is with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge. But the

5. By mastering this perfectly concentrated Meditation, there comes
the illumination of perception. The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of this is illustrated by
what has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> before. When the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is able to throw
aside the trammels of emotional and mental limitation, and to open his
eyes, he sees clearly, he attains to illuminated perception. A poet once
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that Occultism is the conscious cultivation of genius; and it is
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> attains to the perceptions of

its possessor recognizes this or not. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. The greatest in all ages have recognized this and <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span>
their testimony on record. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> in wisdom who have not

reverence, of selfless devotion to truth, of humility, as was Darwin;
and reverence and humility are the unconscious recognition of the
nearness of the Spirit, that Divinity which broods over us, a Master
o'er a slave.

It is to be attained step by step. It is a question, not of miracle, but
of evolution, of growth. Newton had to master the multiplication table,
then the four rules of arithmetic, then the rudiments of algebra, before
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the binomial theorem. At each point, there was attention,
concentration, insight; until these were attained, no progress to the
next point was possible. So with Darwin. He had to learn the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> and
use of leaf and flower, of bone and muscle; the characteristics of
genera and species; the distribution of plants and animals, before he

idea was at last able to shine. So is it with all knowledge. So is it
with <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> knowledge. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Take</span> the matter this way: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> subject

I can to solve it, to fulfil its duties, to learn its lessons. I try to

this, I gather a harvest for the evening, I gain a deeper insight into

7. This threefold power, of Attention, Meditation, Contemplation, is
more interior than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of growth previously described.

Very naturally so; because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of growth previously described
were concerned with the extrication of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from psychic

8. But this triad is still exterior to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> vision which is
unconditioned, free from the seed of mental analyses.

The reason is this: The threefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> we have been considering, the
triad of Attention, Contemplation, Meditation is, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

it completely. There is a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> stage, where the beam of
consciousness is turned back <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> itself, and the <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span>
consciousness enters into, and knows, the All consciousness. This is
a being, a being in immortality, rather than a knowing; it is free from
mental analysis or mental forms. It is not an activity of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>
mind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. It is an activity of the soul.
Had Newton risen to this <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> stage, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have known, not the

Had Darwin risen to this, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have seen the Soul, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>

there is the overcoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes
the manifestation of the mind-impress of Control. Then the perceiving
consciousness follows after the moment of Control.

This is the development of Control. The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> seems to be this:
Some object enters the field of observation, and at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> violently

firmly in hand, steadying itself, and viewing the matter calmly from
above. This steadying effort of the will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the perceiving

Or a comet, unheralded, appears in the sky <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a flaming sword. The

that fine musician, the Soul. Here again, innumerable small efforts of
attention will accumulate into mastery, and a mastery worth winning.
For a concrete example, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the gradual conquest of each day, the

manifold aspect of any object, the sum of all its characteristics and
properties. This is to be held firmly in the mind. Then there is the
perception of the object as a unity, as a whole, the perception of its
essence. First, the details <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be clearly perceived; then the essence

mind-images in the thoughts of others, with the shade of feeling which
goes with them, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reading their thoughts as easily as he hears their

which are intuitively perceived by everyone.

18. When the mind-impressions <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> visible, there comes an
understanding of previous births.

This is simple enough if we grasp the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of rebirth. The fine harvest
of past experiences is drawn into the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> nature, forming, indeed,
the basis of its development. When the consciousness has been raised
to a point above these fine subjective impressions, and can look down
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them from above, this will in itself be a remembering of past
births.

19. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on mind-images is gained
the understanding of the thoughts of others.

Here, for those who can profit by it, is the secret of thought-reading.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Take</span> the simplest <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of intentional <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> transference. It is the
testimony of those who have done this, that the perceiving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>

seen. With it comes a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the feeling and temper of the other

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> appears to be simple: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be able to perceive the

23. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on sympathy, compassion

Unity is the reality; separateness the illusion. The nearer we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to

kindness are modes of this unity of heart, whereby we rejoice with
those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are

This is a pretty image. Elephants possess not only force, but poise and
fineness of control. They can lift a straw, a child, a tree with perfectly
judged control and effort. So the simile is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> one. By detachment,
by withdrawing into the soul's reservoir of power, we can gain all
these, force and fineness and poise; the ability to handle with equal
mastery <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> small and great, concrete and abstract alike.

This has several meanings: First, by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the constitution

Here again are <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> meanings. The moon is, first, the companion

a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the motions of the stars.

Addressing Duty, stern daughter of the Voice of God, Wordsworth
finely said:

     <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> cost preserve the stars from wrong,
     And the most ancient heavens through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> are fresh and strong--

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> suggesting a profound relation between the moral powers and the
powers that rule the worlds. So in this Sutra the fixed polestar is the
eternal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> about which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> move, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the star toward
which points the axis of the earth. Deep mysteries attend both, and the
veil of mystery is only to be raised by Meditation, by open-eyed vision
of the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

29. Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the
lower trunk brings an understanding of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of the bodily powers.
We are coming to a vitally important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the teaching of Yoga:
namely, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man's attainment of full self-consciousness, the
awakening of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as a self-conscious individual, behind
and above the natural man. In this awakening, and in the process of
gestation which precedes it, there is a close relation with the powers
of the natural man, which are, in a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sense, the projection,
outward and downward, of the powers of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. This is
notably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of that creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> which, when
embodied in the natural man, becomes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of generation. Not
only is this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of the continuance of the bodily race of
mankind, but further, in the individual, it is the key to the dominance
of the personal life. Rising, as it were, through the life-channels of the
body, it flushes the personality with physical force, and maintains and
colours the illusion that the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is the dominant and
all-important expression of life. In due time, when the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
has begun to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> form, the creative force will be drawn off, and
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> operative in building the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, just as it
has been operative in the building of physical bodies, through
generation in the natural world.

Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this force means,
first, that rising of the consciousness into the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, already
described, which gives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sure foothold for Meditation; and then,
from that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> point of vantage, not only an insight into the
creative force, in its <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> and physical aspects, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a gradually
attained control of this wonderful force, which will mean its direction
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, and its gradual withdrawal from the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the natural man, until the over-pressure, so general and such
a fruitful source of misery in our day, is abated, and purity takes the

This over pressure, which is the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
evils and so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> shame, is an abnormal, not a natural,
condition. It is primarily due to <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> blindness, to blindness
regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, and ignorance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of his existence; for
by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which, were
they open, the creative force <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> flow into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man, there building up an immortal vesture. There is no cure for
blindness, with its consequent over-pressure and attendant misery and
shame, but <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspiration, sacrifice, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> birth
from above. There is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to lighten the burden, to lift the
misery and shame from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> life. Therefore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us follow after
sacrifice and aspiration, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us seek the light. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we
gain that insight into the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of the bodily powers, and that mastery
of them, which this Sutra implies.

30. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> of the throat, there comes the cessation of hunger and thirst.

We are continuing the study of the bodily powers and centres of force
in their relation to the powers and forces of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. We have
already considered the dominant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of physical life, the creative
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which secures the continuance of physical life; and, further, the
manner in which, through aspiration and sacrifice, it is gradually raised
and <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> to the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of upbuilding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. We
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> now to the dominant psychic force, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which manifests
itself in speech, and in virtue of which the voice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> carry so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of
the personal magnetism, endowing the orator with a tongue of fire,
magical in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to arouse and rule the emotions of his hearers.
This emotional power, this distinctively psychical force, is the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span>
of "hunger and thirst," the psychical hunger and thirst for sensations,
which is the source of our two-sided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of emotionalism, with its
hopes and fears, its expectations and memories, its desires and hates.
The source of this psychical power, or, perhaps we should say, its
centre of activity in the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be in the cavity of the
throat. Thus, in the Taittiriya Upanishad it is written: "There is this
shining ether in the inner being. Therein is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, formed
through thought, immortal, golden. Inward, in the palate, the organ
that hangs down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a nipple,-this is the womb of Indra. And there,
where the dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown
of the head."

Indra is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to the creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of which we have
spoken, and which, we are told, resides in "the organ which hangs
down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a nipple, inward, in the palate."

31. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the
channel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "tortoise-formed," comes steadfastness.

We are concerned now with the centre of nervous or psychical force
below the cavity of the throat, in the chest, in which is felt the
sensation of fear; the centre, the disturbance of which sets the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span>
beating miserably with dread, or which produces that <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of terror
through which the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to stand still.

When the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> concerning fear is thoroughly mastered, through
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> insight into the immortal, fearless life, then this force is
perfectly controlled; there is no more fear, just as, through the control
of the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> through the nerve-centre in the
throat, there comes a cessation of "hunger and thirst." Thereafter,
these forces, or their <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> prototypes, are turned to the building of
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

Always, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be remembered, the victory is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> one;
only later does it <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> control of the bodily powers.

32. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> in the head
comes the vision of the Masters who have attained.

The tradition is, that there is a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> centre of force in the head,
perhaps the "pineal gland," which some of our Western philosophers
have supposed to be the dwelling of the soul, a centre which is, as it
were, the door <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> between the natural and the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. It is the
seat of that better and wiser consciousness behind the outward
looking consciousness in the forward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the head; that better and
wiser consciousness of "the back of the mind," which views <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>

This is really the supplement, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> side, of the Sutra just
translated. Step by step, as the better consciousness, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>

34 By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the heart, the interior

The <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> here seems to mean, as it so often does in the Upanishads,
the interior, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> nature, the consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man,
which is related to the heart, and to the wisdom of the heart. By
steadily seeking after, and finding, the consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man, by coming to consciousness as the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, a perfect

man. All personal experience really exists for the sake of another:
namely, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on
experience for the sake of the Self, comes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>

abstract, descends into life, and forms a personality, which, through
the stress and storm of life, is hammered into a definite and concrete

self-conscious, concrete individuality of his other parent, the personal

"conceived of the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit." Of this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> birth it is said: "that which

besides the senses of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, there awakes his mind, that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> counterpart of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the physical man, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of

divination. This power, as we have seen, owes its virtue to the unity,
the continuity, of consciousness, whereby whatever is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to any
consciousness, is knowable by any other consciousness. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the

37. These powers stand in contradistinction to the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
vision. In manifestation they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> magical powers.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is destined to supersede the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, as the

a Master. The opened powers of tile <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision,

glories; the soul's growth and splendour have no limit. So that, if the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers we have been considering are regarded as in any
<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> final, they are a hindrance, a barrier to the <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> man. But viewed from below, from the standpoint of
normal physical experience, they are powers truly magical; as the
powers natural to a four-dimensional being will appear magical to a
three-dimensional being.

38. Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning
the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other
body.

In due time, after the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been formed and grown stable
through the forces and virtues already enumerated, and after the
senses of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> have awaked, there comes the transfer of
the dominant consciousness, the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of individuality, from the
physical to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man. Thereafter the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is felt to be
a secondary, a subordinate, an instrument through whom the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> works; and the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is felt to be the real individuality.
This is, in a sense, the attainment to full salvation and immortal life;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is not the final goal or resting place, but only the beginning of
the greater way.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> for this transfer are described as the weakening of the
causes of bondage, and an understanding of the method of passing
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> consciousness to the other. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be
described as detach meet, and comes from the conquest of the
delusion that the personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> is the real man. When that delusion
abates and is held in check, the finer consciousness of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> begins to shine in the background of the mind. The transfer of the
<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of individuality to this finer consciousness, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, then becomes a matter of recollection, of attention;
primarily, a matter of taking a deeper interest in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and doings of
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, than in the pleasures or occupations of the
personality. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it is said: "Lay not up for yourselves treasures
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth, where moth and rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves
break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
where <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> moth nor rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves do not
break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> be also."

39. Through mastery of the upward-life comes freedom from the
dangers of water, morass, and thorny places, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
ascension is gained.

Here is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the sentences, so characteristic of this author, and,
indeed, of the Eastern spirit, in which there is an obvious exterior
meaning, and, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> this, a clear interior meaning, not quite so
obvious, but <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more vital.

The surface <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is, that by mastery of a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> power, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> here
the upward-life, and akin to levitation, there comes the ability to walk
on water, or to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> over thorny places <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wounding the feet.

But there is a deeper meaning. When we speak of the disciple's path
as a path of thorns, we use a symbol; and the same symbol is used
here. The upward-life <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> something more than the power, often
manifested in abnormal psychical experiences, of levitating the
physical body, or near-by physical objects. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of aspiration, of upward will, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> builds, and then awakes the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, and finally transfers the conscious individuality to him;
for it is he who passes safely over the waters of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and rebirth, and
is not pierced by the thorns in the path. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that he
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> tread the path of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> look for a home in the air,
and afterwards in the ether.

Of the upward-life, this is written in the Katha Upanishad: "A hundred
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> are the heart's channels; of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> passes to the crown.
Going up this, he comes to the immortal." This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
ascension spoken of in the Sutra.

40. By mastery of the binding-life comes radiance.

In the Upanishads, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that this binding-life unites the upward-life
to the downward-life, and these lives have their analogies in the "vital
breaths" in the body. The <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> seems to be, that, when
the personality is <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> thoroughly under control of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man, through the life-currents which bind them together, the personality
is endowed with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> force, a strong personal magnetism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> call it, such as is often an appanage of genius.

But the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> seems to mean more than this and to have in view the

43. When that condition of consciousness is reached, which is
far-reaching and not confined to the body, which is outside the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

worn away.

Perhaps the best comment on this is afforded by the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Paul: "I

The condition is, briefly, that of the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, who sees
and hears beyond the veil.

44. Mastery of the elements comes from perfectly concentrated
Meditation on their five forms: the gross, the elemental, the subtle, the
inherent, the purposive. These five forms are analogous to those
recognized by modern physics: solid, liquid, gaseous, radiant and
ionic. When the piercing vision of the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
directed to the forms of matter, from within, as it were, from behind
the scenes, then perfect mastery over the "beggarly elements" is
attained. This is, perhaps, equivalent to the injunction: "Inquire of the
earth, the air, and the water, of the secrets they hold for you. The
development of your inner senses will enable you to do this."

45. Thereupon will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the manifestation of the atomic and other

47. Mastery over the powers of perception and action comes through
perfectly concentrated Meditation on their fivefold forms; namely,
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to grasp their distinctive nature, the element of
self-consciousness in them, their inherence, and their purposiveness.

Take, for example, sight. This possesses, first, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to grasp,
apprehend, perceive; second, it has its distinctive <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of perception;
that is, visual perception; third, it always carries with its operations
self-consciousness, the thought: "I perceive"; fourth sight has the

utmost star; fifth, it is used for the purposes of the Seer. So with the
other senses. Perfectly concentrated Meditation on each sense, a
viewing it from behind and within, as is possible for the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man,
brings a mastery of the scope and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> character of each sense, and of

We are further enumerating the endowments of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> these is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to traverse space with the swiftness of

goes, in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> he already is. <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">Thought</span> has now <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
of locomotion. He is, therefore, independent of instruments, and can
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> his force to bear directly, wherever he wills.

body, he attains to mastery over all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all.

The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is enmeshed in the web of the emotions; desire, fear,
ambition, passion; and impeded by the mental forms of separateness
and materialism. When these meshes are sundered, these obstacles
completely overcome, then the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in his own
wide world, strong, mighty, wise. He uses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> powers, with a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> scope and energy, working <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Companions.
To such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> it is said: "Thou <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> now a disciple, able to stand, able
to hear, able to see, able to speak, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> conquered desire and
attained to self-knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its bloom and
recognized it, and heard the voice of the silence."

50. By absence of all self-indulgence at this point, when the seeds of
bondage to sorrow are destroyed, pure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> being is attained.

The seeking of indulgence for the personal self, whether through
passion or ambition, sows the seed of future sorrow. For this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span>
indulgence of the personality is a double sin against the real; a sin
against the cleanness of life, and a sin against the universal being,
which permits no exclusive particular good, since, in the real, all
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> possessions are held in common. This twofold sin brings its
reacting punishment, its confining bondage to sorrow. But ceasing
from self-indulgence brings purity, liberation, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life.

51. There should be complete overcoming of allurement or pride in
the invitations of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> realms of life, lest attachment to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> arise once more.

The commentator tells us that disciples, seekers for union, are of four
degrees: first, those who are entering the path; second, those who are
in the realm of allurements; third, those who have won the victory
over matter and the senses; fourth, those who stand firm in pure
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> life. To the second, especially, the caution in the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is
addressed. More modern teachers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> express the same <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> by a
warning against the delusions and fascinations of the psychic realm,
which open around the disciple, as he breaks through into the unseen
worlds. These are the dangers of the anteroom. Safety lies in passing
on swiftly into the inner chamber. "Him that overcometh will I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>
a pillar in the temple of my God, and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go no more out."

52. From perfectly concentrated Meditation on the divisions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
and their succession comes that wisdom which is born of discernment.

The Upanishads <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> of the liberated that "he has passed beyond the
triad of time"; he no longer sees <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as projected into past, <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> and
future, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> these are forms of the mind; but beholds all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> spread
out in the quiet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of the Eternal. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem to be the same
thought, and to point to that clear-eyed <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> perception which is
above time; that wisdom born of the unveiling of Time's delusion.
Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> the disciple live <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> nor the future, but in
the Eternal.

53. Hence comes discernment between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> nature,
not distinguished by difference of kind, character or position. Here, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in the preceding Sutra, we are close to the doctrine that
distinctions of order, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space are creations of the mind; the
threefold prism through which the real object appears to us distorted
and refracted. When the prism is withdrawn, the object returns to its
primal unity, no longer distinguishable by the mind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> clearly
knowable by that high <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> discernment, of illumination,
which is above the mind.

54. The wisdom which is born of discernment is starlike; it discerns
all things, and all conditions of things, it discerns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> succession:
simultaneously.

That wisdom, that intuitive, divining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is starlike, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the
commentator, because it shines with its own light, because it rises on
high, and illumines all things. Nought is hid from it, whether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

INTRODUCTION TO <span class="t24 hoverable">BOOK</span> IV

The third <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of the Sutras has fairly completed the history of the
birth and growth of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, and the enumeration of his
powers; at least so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as concerns that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> epoch in his immortal life,
which immediately succeeds, and supersedes, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the natural
man.

In the fourth book, we are to consider what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> call the
mechanism of salvation, the ideally simple working of cosmic <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span>
which brings the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to birth, growth, and fulness of power,
and prepares him for the splendid, toilsome further stages of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
journey home.

The Sutras are here brief to obscurity; only a few words, for example,
are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> triune mystery and illusion of Time; a phrase or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> indicates the sweep of some universal law. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is hoped that,
by keeping our eyes fixed on the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, remembering that he
is the hero of the story, and that all that is written concerns him and
his adventures, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be able to find our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through this thicket of
tangled words, and keep in our hands the clue to the mystery.

The last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the last <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> needs little introduction. In a sense, it is
the most important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> treatise, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> it unmasks the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the personality, that psychical "mind," which is the wakeful
enemy of all who seek to tread the path. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> now, we can hear it
whispering the doubt whether that can be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> path, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> sets

If this, then, be the most vital and fundamental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the teaching,
should it not stand at the very beginning? It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> seem so at first; but
had it stood there, we should not have comprehended it. For he who

by the use of drugs, or by incantations, or by fervour, or by
Meditation.

<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> powers have been enumerated and described in the preceding
sections. They are the normal powers of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, the
antetype, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> edition, of the powers of the natural man.
Through these powers, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands, sees, hears, speaks,
in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, as the physical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> stands, sees, hears, speaks
in the natural world.

There is a counterfeit presentment of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

powers of vision, of hearing, of movement; he has left the natural

He has <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from the shore, but has
not gained the further verge of the river. He is borne along by the
stream, with no foothold on either shore. Leaving the actual, he has
fallen short of the real, caught in the limbo of vanities and delusions.
The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of this aberrant phantasm is always the worship of a false,
vain self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of dreams, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> one's own breast. This is the
psychic man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of delusive and bewildering psychic powers.

Psychical powers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be gained by drugs, as poverty, shame,

are baneful, cutting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> off from consciousness of the restraining

While sinking, he believes that he has risen; growing weaker, he thinks
himself full of strength; beholding illusions, he takes them to be true.
Such are the powers gained by drugs; they are wholly psychic, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span>
the real powers, the spiritual, can <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be so gained.

Incantations are affirmations of half-truths concerning <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and
matter, what is and what is not, which <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and slowly
build up a wraith of powers and a delusive well-being. These, too, are
of the psychic realm of dreams.

Lastly, there are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> powers of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, built up and
realized in Meditation, through reverent obedience to <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> law, to
the pure conditions of being, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> realm.

2. The transfer of powers from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> venture to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> comes through

3. The apparent, immediate <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> is not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of the creative

away.

The husbandman tills his field, breaking up the clods of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> into fine
mould, penetrable to air and rain; he sows his seed, carefully covering
it, for fear of birds and the wind; he waters the seed-laden earth,
turning the little rills from the irrigation tank now this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and that,
removing obstacles from the channels, until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> How of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span>
vitalizes the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> field. And so the plants germinate and grow, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. But it is not the
husbandman who makes them grow. It is, first, the miraculous plasmic
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in the grain of seed, which brings <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> after its kind; then the
alchemy of sunlight which, in presence of the green colouring matter
of the leaves, gathers hydrogen from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> and carbon from the
gases in the air, and mingles them in the hydro-carbons of plant
growth; and, finally, the wholly occult vital powers of the plant itself,
stored up through ages, and flowing down from the primal sources of
life. The husbandman but removes the obstacles. He plants and
waters, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> gives the increase.

So with the finer husbandman of diviner fields. He tills and sows, but
the growth of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> comes through the surge and flow of
divine, creative forces and powers. Here, again, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> gives the
increase. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> puts forth, for the manifestation of its
powers, a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> and finer vesture, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

4. Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the
Boston of the feeling of selfhood.

The Self, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Teacher, in turn attaches itself to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
vestures: first, to the physical body, then to the finer body, and
thirdly to the causal body. Finally it stands <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> radiant, luminous,
joyous, as the Self.

When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> attributes itself to the physical body, there arise the
states of bodily consciousness, built up about the physical self.

When the Self, breaking through this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> illusion, begins to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> and
feel itself in the finer body, to find selfhood there, then the states of
consciousness of the finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into being; or, to speak exactly,
the finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and its states of consciousness arise and grow together.

But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not dwell permanently there. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> learn to find
itself in the causal body, to build up the wide and luminous fields of
consciousness that belong to that.

Nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> it dwell forever there, for there remains the fourth state, the
divine, with its own splendour and everlastingness.

It is all a question of the states of consciousness; all a question of
raising the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of selfhood, until it dwells forever in the Eternal.

5. In the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> fields of manifestation, the Consciousness, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span>
one, is the elective <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> states of consciousness.

Here is the splendid teaching of oneness that lies at the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of the
Eastern wisdom. Consciousness is ultimately One, everywhere and
forever. The Eternal, the Father, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> of All Beings. And so,
in each <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> who is but a facet of that Self, Consciousness is
One. Whether it breaks through as the dull <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of physical life, or the
murky flame of the psychic and passional, or the radiance of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man, or the full glory of the Divine, it is ever the Light,
naught but the Light. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Consciousness is the effective <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of
all states of consciousness, on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> plane.

6. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> states of consciousness, that which is born of
Contemplation is free from the seed of future sorrow.

 Where the consciousness breaks <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in the physical body, and the
full play of bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> begins, its progression carries with it inevitable
limitations. Birth involves death. Meetings have their partings. Hunger
alternates with satiety. Age follows on the heels of youth. So do the
states of consciousness run along the circle of birth and death.

With the psychic, the alternation between prize and penalty is swifter.
Hope has its shadow of fear, or it is no hope. Exclusive <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> is
tortured by jealousy. Pleasure passes through deadness into pain.
Pain's surcease brings pleasure back again. So here, too, the states of
consciousness run their circle. In all psychic states there is egotism,
which, indeed, is the very essence of the psychic; and where there is
egotism there is ever the seed of future sorrow. Desire carries
bondage in its womb.

But where the pure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness begins, free from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> and

bondage or freedom. It is the succession of the forces which built up

The answer is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the Sutra just translated. The driving-force is
withdrawn and directed to the upbuilding of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> body.

When the building impulses and forces are withdrawn, the tendency

12. The difference between that which is past and that which is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

of their properties.

Here we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to a high and difficult matter, which has always been
held to be of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> moment in the Eastern wisdom: the <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that
the division of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> into past, <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> and future is, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> measure,
an illusion; that past, present, future all dwell <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in the eternal
Now.

The discernment of this <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> has been held to be so necessarily a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span>
of wisdom, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the names of the Enlightened is: "he who has
passed beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times: past, present, future."

So the Western Master said: "Before Abraham was, I am"; and again,
"I am with you always, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the world"; using the eternal
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> for past and future alike. With the same purpose, the Master
speaks of himself as "the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the
end, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and the last."

And a Master of our own <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> writes: "I feel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> irritated at having

concepts of the objective phases of the subjective whole, they are
about as ill adapted for the purpose, as an axe for fine carving."

In the eternal Now, both past and future are consummated.

Bjorklund, the Swedish philosopher, has <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> stated the same truth:

"Neither past nor future can exist to God; He lives undividedly,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> limitations, and needs not, as man, to plot out his existence in
a series of moments. Eternity then is not identical with unending time;
it is a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of existence, related to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as the perfect to the

Conceived by God, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is eternal in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
sense, but conceived, by himself, man's eternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is clothed in the
limitations we call time. The eternal is a constant <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

13. These properties, whether manifest or latent, are of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Potencies are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> manifested modifications of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
primal material, which stands opposite to perceiving consciousness.
These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Potencies are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Substance, Force, Darkness; or
viewed rather for their moral colouring, Goodness, Passion, Inertness.

empty space of darkness. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> mental state is either good, or
passional, or inert. So, whether subjective or objective, latent or
manifest, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> themselves to the perceiving
consciousness are compounded of these three. This is a fundamental
doctrine of the Sankhya system.

14. The external manifestation of an object takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when the
transformations ore in the same phase.

We should be inclined to express the same <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> by saying, for example,
that a sound is audible, when it consists of vibrations <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
compass of the auditory nerve; that an object is visible, when either
directly or by reflection, it sends <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> luminiferous vibrations <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span>
the compass of the retina and the optic nerve. Vibrations below or
above that compass <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> no impression at all, and the object remains
invisible; as, for example, a kettle of boiling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> in a dark room,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the kettle is sending <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> heat vibrations closely akin to light.

So, when the vibrations of the object and those of the perceptive
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> are in the same phase, the external manifestation of the object
takes place.

There seems to be a further suggestion that the appearance of an
object in the "present," or its remaining hid in the "past," or "future,"
is likewise a question of phase, and, just as the range of vibrations
perceived <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be increased by the development of finer senses, so
the perception of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> past, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to come, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be easy from
a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> point of view.

15. The paths of material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and of states of consciousness are
distinct, as is manifest from the fact that the same object <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> produce
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> impressions in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> minds.

Having shown that our bodily condition and circumstances depend on
Karma, while Karma depends on perception and will, the sage
recognizes the fact that from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be drawn the false deduction
that material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are in no wise <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from states of mind. The
same <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> has occurred, and still occurs, to all philosophers; and,
by various reasonings, they all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to the same wise conclusion; that
the material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by the mood of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> mind, but
is rather the manifestation of the totality of invisible Being, whether
we call this Mahat, with the ancients, or Ether, with the moderns.

16. Nor do material objects depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a single mind, for how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
they remain objective to others, if that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> ceased to think of them?

This is but a further development of the <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of the preceding
Sutra, carrying on the <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that, while the universe is spiritual, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
its material expression is ordered, consistent, ruled by law, not subject
to the whims or affirmations of a single mind. Unwelcome material
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be escaped by <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> growth, by rising to a realm above
them, and not by denying their existence on their own plane. So that
our system is <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> materialistic, nor idealistic in the extreme sense,
but rather intuitional and spiritual, holding that matter is the
manifestation of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> as a whole, a reflection or externalization of
spirit, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> spirit, everywhere obedient to law. The path of
liberation is not through denial of matter but through denial of the
wills of self, through obedience, and that aspiration which builds the
vesture of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> man.

17. An object is perceived, or not perceived, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is,
or is not, tinged with the colour of the object.

The simplest manifestation of this is the matter of attention. Our minds
apprehend what they wish to apprehend; all else passes unnoticed, or,
on the other hand, we perceive what we resent, as, for example, the

it at all.

But the deeper <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is, that out of the vast totality of objects ever
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> in the universe, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> perceives only those which conform
to the hue of its Karma.

Here is teaching of the utmost import, both for understanding and for

only through intuition, the vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Man.

The solution of the mystery lies not in the "mind" but beyond it, in the

22. When the psychical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> takes on the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>

own <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> intelligence.

We are considering a stage of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at which the psychical

plastic substance the images of the earthy; purified now, it reflects the
image of the heavenly, giving the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> a visible form.
The Self, beholding that visible form, in which its <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span>
has, as it were, taken palpable shape, thereby reaches self-recognition,
self-comprehension. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> sees itself in this mirror, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
becomes not only conscious, but self-conscious. This is, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
point of view, the purpose of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> evolutionary process.

23. The psychic nature, taking on the colour of the Seer and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
seen, leads to the perception of all objects.

In the unregenerate man, the psychic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is saturated with images
of material things, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen, or heard, or tasted, or felt; and this
web of dynamic images forms the ordinary material and driving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of life. The sensation of sweet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> tasted clamours to be renewed,
and drives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> into effort to obtain its renewal; so he adds image
to image, each dynamic and importunate, piling up sin's intolerable
burden.

Then comes regeneration, and the washing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> of sin, through the
fiery, creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Soul, which burns out the stains of the
psychic vesture, purifying it as gold is refined in the furnace. The
suffering of regeneration springs from this indispensable purifying.

Then the psychic vesture begins to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> on the colour of the Soul, no
longer stained, but suffused with golden light; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> red

puts on fair raiment; for of this cleansing it is said: <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> your sins
be as scarlet, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be white as snow; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they be as crimson,
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be as wool.

24. The psychic nature, which has been printed with mind-images of
innumerable material things, exists now for the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Man,
building for him.

The "mind," once the tyrant, is now the slave, recognized as outward,
separate, not Self, a well-trained instrument of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Man.

For it is not ordained for the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> that, finding his high realm,
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> enter altogether there, and <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> out of the vision of mankind.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that he dwells in heaven, but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> dwells on earth.

familiar friends, but he has at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> kinship with

sinlessness, he finds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that the world's sin and shame are his, not to
share, but to atone; finding kinship with angels, he likewise finds his

For this work, he, who now stands in the heavenly realm, needs his
instrument on earth; and this instrument he finds, ready to his hand,
and fitted and perfected by the very struggles he has waged against it,
in the personality, the "mind," of the personal man. This once tyrant is
now his servant and perfect ambassador, bearing witness, before men,
of heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in this <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> doing the will and
working the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of the Father.

25. For him who discerns between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Man,
there comes perfect fruition of the longing after the real being of the
Self.

realized, and ten times more than realized, once the long, arduous
fight against the "mind," and the mind's worldview is won. And then
it will be seen that unfaith and despair were but weapons of the

This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the secret of the Soul, that salvation means, not merely

uncomprehended shadows, myths, demi-gods, fill the memories of all
the nobler peoples. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> cometh, when he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be known, no

27. In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the
impressions of the dynamic mind-images.

The battle is <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and arduous. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> there be no mistake as to that. Go

this conflict is begun, it can be ended only by sweeping victory, and
unconditional, unreserved surrender of the vanquished.

28. These are to be overcome as it was taught that hindrances should
be overcome.

These <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> enemies and fears are to be overcome by ceaselessly

obedience to the will of God, he comes into oneness of being with

30. Thereon comes surcease from sorrow and the burden of toil.

Such a one, it is said, is free from the bond of Karma, from the burden
of toil, from that debt to <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> which comes from <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> done in
self-love and desire. Free from self-will, he is free from sorrow, too,
for sorrow comes from the fight of self-will against the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will,

obedience, thereby enters into joy.

31. When all veils are rent, all stains washed away, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

These veils rent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t9 t15 t16 t20 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">shalt</span> enter into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and

32. Thereafter comes the completion of the series of transformations
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> potencies, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> their purpose is attained.

It is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the beauty and wisdom of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Indian teachings, the

He is the crown of evolution: at his coming, the goal of all
development is attained.

33. The series of transformations is divided into moments. When the
series is completed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to duration.

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds of eternity, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the commentary: the eternity of
immortal life, which belongs to the Spirit, and the eternity of change,
which inheres in Nature, in all that is not Spirit. While we are content
to live in and for Nature, in the Circle of Necessity, Sansara, we doom
ourselves to perpetual change. That which is born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> die, and that

of transformations.

But the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> enters a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> order; for him, there is no longer
eternal change, but eternal Being. He has entered into the joy of his
Lord. This <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> birth, which makes him heir of the Everlasting,
sets a term to change; it is the culmination, the crowning
transformation, of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> realm of change.

34. Pure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is, therefore, the inverse resolution of the
potencies of Nature, which have emptied themselves of their value for
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> man; or it is the return of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of pure
Consciousness to its essential form.

Here we have a splendid generalization, in which our wise philosopher
finally reconciles the naturalists and the idealists, expressing the crown
and <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of his teaching, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in the terms of the naturalist, and then in
the terms of the idealist.

The birth and growth of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Man, and his entry into his
immortal heritage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be regarded, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> our philosopher, either as
the culmination of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> process of natural evolution and
involution, where "that which flowed from out the boundless deep,
turns again home"; or it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be looked at, as the Vedantins look at it,
as the restoration of pure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Consciousness to its pristine and
essential form. There is no discrepancy or conflict between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
views, which are but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> accounts of the same thing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> those
who study the wise philosopher, be they naturalist or idealist, have no
excuse to linger over dialectic subtleties or disputes. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are
lifted from their path, lest they should be tempted to delay over them,
and they are left facing the path itself, stretching upward and onward
from their feet to the everlasting hills, radiant with infinite Light.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
