HIS <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">BOOK</span> makes no claim to literary merit. It is
simply a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of research and documentation,
giving evidence and facts which I trust will help the
reader in drawing his own conclusions. In the course of
my researches as an international political investigator
into the causes of social unrest, I have probed the depths
of infamy which now surrounds, not ours only, but also
the next generation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> right to lead a decent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

however much " protected", <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Dairymaid or

last ten years, to follow as one of a group of
investigators.
Today, most of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are afraid to be good.
They strive to be broadminded and tolerant ! It is
fashionable to be tolerant — but mostly tolerant of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
— and this new code has reached the proportions of
demanding intolerance of good. The wall of resistance
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> been broken down and no longer affords
protection to those who, persecuted by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> doers, stand
in need of it.
Worse still, there are cases wherein virtuous people's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> name is relentlessly " filched from them ", but no
effort will be made by the presumed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to rally
to their defence. Happy are they if they themselves can
discover the cause of their ruin, materiel or moral, either
partial or total.
In <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> to the public, I have endeavoured
to expose some of the means and methods <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by a
secret world, one might almost say an underworld, to
penetrate, dominate and destroy not only the so-called
upper classes, but also the better portion of all classes.
There are those who feel confident that if they refrain
from joining any <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> or group and avoid entanglements, no harm can befall them. To such, let me say that
situations can be, and are, <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> for innocent dupes
every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and wrecked homes are the direct result.

midst of a tumultuous sea of evil, spells security.
Irrefutable evidence of a particular example of
underworld tyranny has come into my possession. The
victim's guilt was her reluctance to step from virtue into
the mire of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> which surrounded her. Moreover she
was intolerant of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and sought to oppose and destroy it.
The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of her persecution at the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of her foes is
complete. She belonged to what is termed <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> as did
also some of the other actors in this bewildering drama.
The world, social, financial, legal and, shall we say also,
the underworld, leaving to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> its generally
accepted literal meaning, knows them. So many Jekylls
and Hydes stalk about unsuspectingly in our midst !
From such an example I have been led to the
conclusion that, among others, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> factors can help
one from being completely destroyed by the combined
forces of that" underworld " : a flawless life,
independent means and real friends, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of which
must be backed by a fearless determination to fight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
on all points of the Masonic compass.
In these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> when apparently vice triumphs and

corruption of which led to theocratic rule, namely,
Brahminism, the Ancient Egyptian Cult, Mosaism or Judaism,
Christianism and Mahometanism, one finds the accepted
belief of Monotheism as the basis of esoteric or secret belief
or doctrine. Monotheism is here <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of First

Whereas the Egyptian <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> priesthood of Memphis kept
this theory as the esoteric teaching of the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> adepts, Moses,

to the Israelitic sect to which he belonged, embodying it in a
deity, the terrible Jehovah of the Jews.
Another <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the esoteric teaching was that of occultism,
the development of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> psychic forces which, when
misused, lead to the practice of magic. The esoteric part of all
religions or hermeticism, the teaching and practice of
occultism, led to the development of what might be termed
the religion of the secret, which eventually overshadowed and
helped to dissimulate subversive activities.
It is with this that we are chiefly concerned and will
endeavour, to some degree, to show its baneful influence on

THE <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">MEANING</span> OF OCCULTISM

A summary and some explanation of the principal forms of
occultism must precede the chapters which deal with the
historical <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of this subject, and the objections, those of the
credulous as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as those of the sceptics, must be foreseen
and forestalled. Many persons are tempted to deny, arbitrarily
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> examination, statements on matters of which
they have no previous knowledge, but even the possible
criticism of such as these must have received due consideration.
In this age of wireless and aeroplanes, one of the fads of the
modern highbrow is to scoff at such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as sorcerers,
magic and evocations as old wives' tales. Tales of ancient
history ! There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who refuse to believe in the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the supernatural, perhaps we should say
supernormal, even when confronted with the evidence. Such
are the sceptics who deny everything. Hidebound in their
prejudice, they ignore the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that magic, White or Black, has
now as many adepts as ever, nor can they distinguish between
the different schools of spiritism.
First, there are the charlatans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> tricks in the line of
Spiritism are generally sooner or later unmasked.

25

Second, there are the Occultists who operate in secrecy and
hide their meetings from all but initiates with the greatest
care.
Many persons are duped by charlatans, so the sceptics
persuade themselves of the absolute non-existence of all
diabolical practices in modern times. They are wrong. For
Occultism flourishes now in Europe, Asia, and America. The
Black Mass is said today in Paris and London, and Satanism
has its faithful followers. On this subject one of the most
eminent writers was Carl Hackse, who, under the pseudonym
of Dr. Bataille, made an extensive study of Occultism and
gave his extremely exaggerated views of it in the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Le
Diablc au XIXe Siecle.
The following pages of this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> are mostly either
quotations or abridgements from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> :
" According to the teaching of the Christian churches, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
allows demons certain limited powers, but they are not
permitted to open the gates of hell and release a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> at the
request of one who evokes the dead. The dead, even damned,
will not show themselves if evoked, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> evocations be
answered by those who had succeeded in attaining the
kingdom of heaven, but devils can and do, says the Church,
substitute themselves for the deceased. They will impersonate

" It is also admitted that the fallen angels or spirits will
often manifest to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being called, The theological
hagiographa cite many cases of diabolical apparitions to
saints, apparitions which these saints have been able to repel
and conquer... but what sceptics and agnostic Christians alike
ignore is that besides the drawing room mediums, mediums
for diversion, there are occultists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> vile practices are

The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> is operative magic, also subdivided into
several branches of which the principal are :
Alchemy
Necromancy
Mesmerism
Theurgy
Various miraculous feats
There are moreover some superstitious practices not
specially classed.
Bataille <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> defines some of the foregoing :
Astrology. — Divining the future by the stars. The casting
of horoscopes is its most prevalent practice.
Palmistry. — Divining the future by the hand.
Anthropomancy. — This is one of the practices supposed at
present to have fallen into disuse. It is a horrible, savage
abomination and consists in disembowelling a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being
for the purpose of divining the future by inspection of the
entrails.
Mediaeval history accuses Gilles de Retz of perpetrating
this crime on children, whom he lured to his castle for the
purpose. Tacitus says that the Druids, in ancient Britain, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
to consult their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> by looking into the entrails of their
captives.
Oneirocritics. — Divining the future through interpretation
of dreams.
Aeromancy. — Divination by the study of aerial
phenomena.
Hydromancy. — Divination by the study of liquids or
aquatic phenomena.
Pyromancy. — Divination by fire.
Cartomancy. — Divination by cards.
There is no need to expatiate further on the more or less
grotesque means employed by those who follow these false
sciences. One must be somewhat erratic to imagine that the
future can be foretold by coffee grounds, by the antics of
flames in a grate, by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>

to the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of clairvoyance, but these fortune

governing the practices of these absurdities, are the first to
distrust their art.
Such expedients, disdained by the real occultists, are too
unimportant to be worthy of note. It is quite another <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> to
expose the Satanists, ignored by the public, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sects,
bearing different names in different countries, constitute, in

blindly to their cause.
Throughout the universe, all Luciferian and Satanic rites
bear a basic similarity.
Dealing principally with the practices of contemporary
operative magic, it is Bataille's opinion that as regards the
mysterious <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of Alchemy, its theory is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hermetic

the philosopher's stone, a substance capable of transmuting
base metals into gold and drinkable gold, or the Elixir of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

necessary to prolong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> indefinitely or, at least, to
maintain in old age the faculties of youth. Alchemy as a
science seems now obsolete.
The Alchemists knew the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of microbes and toxins

judged necessary by the " Masters " that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is to be destroyed.
In these cases deaths occur from apparently natural causes!
He further says that Magnetic Mesmerism is the occult
medicine of the Cabalists. One must naturally not confuse the
scientists who are at present making researches in hypnotism
and suggestion, in the interest of science, with the emulators
of Cagliostro <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> aim is to procure diversions, often
wicked and immoral. Scientific magnetism is still an obscure
question being studied by theologians, physiologists and
criminologists, whereas that of the adepts of magic has
nothing to do with this ; it is a branch of the subterranean
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> that is nearing its goal today.
Necromancy is partly divining magic and partly operative
magic. This practice consists in the evocation of the spirits of
the dead. Spiritism and rapping of tables are necromancy, but
if all spiritists are not necessarily Cabalists, all Cabalists are
practicing necromancy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> are far from suspecting the
progress made by necromancy along these lines. Freemasonry
is yearly more and more invaded by the spiritist element to the
extent that, in 1889, an international convention of spiritist
Freemasons attended by about 500 delegates was held at the
Hotel of the Grand Orient of France, rue Cadet, Paris.
This was only a beginning ! 3
Eliphas Levi, a renowned occultist of the 19th century,
writing in Histoire de la Magie, 4 in the following words,
sounds a warning to those who, recklessly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> venture into

writings. The very sight of them induces a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of convulsion

these so-called spirits require sympathetic excitement

<span class="t13 t23 hoverable">Hands</span> must be placed in hands, feet on feet, they must breathe
in each other's faces, these acts often being followed by others
of an obscene character. The initiates, revelling in these forms
of excesses believe themselves to be the elect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and the

each other no resemblance, although Lucifer-Satan manifests
indiscriminately to his faithful followers of both

The Gnostics were not ordinary heretics but constituted an
anti-christian sect. To deceive the multitude, they affected
disagreement with certain doctrines of the Apostles, and the
chiefs selected from among the initiates those destined to
receive, in secret council, the Satanic revelation. Gnosticism
is marked with the seal of Lucifer. It is contemporary with the
Apostle Peter and has continued, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interruption, down

Gnosticism, as the Mother of Freemasonry, has imposed its
mark in the very centre of the chief symbol of this association.
The most conspicuous emblem which one notices on entering
a masonic temple, the one which figures on the seals, on the
rituals, everywhere in fact, appears in the middle of the
interlaced square and compass, it is the five pointed star
framing the letter G. Different explanations of this letter G are
given to the initiates. In the lower grades, one is taught that it
signifies Geometry. To the brothers frequenting the lodges
admitting women as members, it is revealed that the mystic
letter means Generation, but the revelation is attended with

Let us add that the ancient mysteries of Gnosticism have
been known and published in the past. There is no difference
between the Gnosticism of the early ages of Christianity and
modern occultism.
The fundamental principle of Gnosticism was the double
divinity (dual principle) and this is exactly the theological
theory of modern occultism. The Gnostics claimed that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> was Lucifer and that <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> was the devil, that what
the Christians <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> vice was for them virtue, and to the
Christian dogma they opposed Gnosticism, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

Early Gnosticism had its doctors ; the Basilideans, Ophites
and Valentinians. Basilide of Alexandria, one of them, lived
at the end of the first century. He taught metempsychosis and
the principles underlying present-day Theosophy. His system
resembles that of the spiritists of the nineteenth century who
have invented nothing, for they copy Gnosticism even in its
theory of the transmigration of souls. Basilide affirmed that he
was the reincarnation of Plato. Whoever has penetrated into
assemblies of modern theurgists can attest that one of its
current theories is that of reincarnation.
After Basilide came Montanus who died in 212. Montanus
was a grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of the <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of divination. The Bite of
Mizraim (a Freemasonry said to be Egyptian) copies slavishly,
in its Cabalistic grades, all the phantasmagoria of Montanus.
This Gnostic doctor plunged himself into ecstasies and,
according to history, he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> women, Maximilla and
Priscilla, trained to act as his accomplices. The Gnostics came
in crowds to admire their contortions worthy of epileptics.
They had the sacred illness, 10 and were considered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

frenzies and prophesied, their oracular sayings were listened
to with veneration by the adepts.
Were they acting a part, were they just mediums or
somnambulists, or were they what the Roman Catholics <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> "
possessed " ?
This is a hard question to answer.
A modern example of the influence exercised by occult
organizations on the destinies of mankind is to be found in the
history of The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Alliance, founded in 1815 by Alexander I,
Emperor of Russia. This was originally a union of monarchs
pledged to support the Christian Church and to stem the rising
tide of radicalism, revolution and subversion.
In L'Histoire de la Magie (p. 467), Eliphas Levi states that
the spiritist sect of " The Rescuers of Louis XVI ", wishing to
penetrate this organization to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> it for their own purposes,
succeeded in insinuating one of their illumines into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
graces of the Czar. This was Madame Bouche, known to the
adepts as Sister Salome. After eighteen months spent at the
Russian Court, during which she had many secret interviews
with the Emperor, she was supplanted by another
medium-somnambulist of the sect, the famous Madame de
Krudner who acquired so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> an influence

caused the palace to be searched and a man, armed with a
dagger, was found. He confessed, when questioned, that he
had been introduced into the palace by Madame de Krudner
herself. '
One wonders if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> affair was not simply the result
of a clever intrigue calculated to get rid of the prophetess. As
such it was singularly successful for Madame de Krudner was
summarily banished from the Russian Court.
In De la Magonnerie Occulte (pp. 87-88), J. M. Ragon tells
us that " science counts four kinds of Somnambulism : The
natural, the symptomatic, the magnetic and the ecstatic.
" Natural and symptomatic somnambulism are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

The conduct of the subject is

" Magnetic and ecstatic somnambulism differ from one
another insomuch as the one is commanded (willed) and the
other is not. The first is artificial, the other natural. In the first,
the subject is dependent; in the second, he acts independently.
That is why induced somnambulism cures the natural when
substituted for it.
" A lucid somnambulist bears no more resemblance to a

diabolical marvels. In this respect, are not contemporaneous

Secret Gnostic meetings lead to depravity, as the adepts
indulge in every kind of turpitude and obscenity, often under

A further explanation of the phenomenon of induced

the following lines from Eliphas Levi's History of Magic:
" This may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when, through a series of almost

" It attempts to show that it leads to mastership and self
control, but on careful consideration it proves to be merely
conscious mediumship inspired by crafty and wilful deception,
giving the adept a false confidence, inducing him to let go his
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the astral, where, enclosed by
formulae given by these masters themselves, he is completely

A recent practical illustration of these methods is the
teaching contained in a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Asia Mysteriosa by Zam
Bhotiva, (published by Dorbon Aine) which suggests ways

necessarily an adverse factor in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> ; for there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
to suppose that such messages may not be transmitted from
one to another for generations. Thus, the particulars of a
tragedy might be revealed many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after the event, and in

the line through which the <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> was transmitted. For
the spiritist the easy and ever-ready explanation of such a
phenomenon is to ascribe it to the intervention of spirits of the
dead. But to those who have kept pace with the developments
of modern scientific investigation, and who are able to draw
the legitimate and necessary conclusions from the facts
discovered, the explanation is obvious, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the necessity
of entering the domain of the supernatural. "13
On the subject of Hypnotism and Crime, Hudson, writing
further, reaches however a fatally false conclusion which for
many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> remained unchallenged. He states (p. 140) " It is

in the subjective mind. A hypnotic subject will often say,
during the hypnotic sleep, that which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not say in his

" The Stewards prepare the candidate ; the Tyler first, and
afterwards in turn the I. G., Deacons and Junior Wardens should
inspect the candidate to see that everything is strictly correct.
" The preparation symbolises poverty, blindness (or ignorance)
and poverty of spirit, — but it may also signify a purification, i.e.,
that the riches and pleasures which bind one to the material <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of

through the candidate by means of a rod or sword with which

that at this first initiation the candidate is deprived of all metals

want them, but it is here evident that the candidate, unknown
to himself or herself, has acted throughout the ceremony of
initiation under the stress of hypnotism. No longer a <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> agent,

BRAHMINISM

For a brief study of Brahminism, the religion practised in
India, we can hardly do better than quote from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
such recognized authorities as Messrs. Stillson and Hughan. '
In attempting to trace the origin of Brahminism, they make
the following observations :
" After being conquered by the Cuthites under Rama, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Cush, referred to in Genesis x, 2, 7, the Mysteries of
the Deluge were introduced. The worship soon became
divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects. We are not fully apprised when was
first introduced the Brahminic system, composed of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva, constituting the Trimurti... one branch of
which was mild and benevolent, and addressed to Vishnu, the
Preserver, while the other proclaimed the superiority of Siva,
who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Destroyer and the representative of terror
and penance, barbarity and blood ; in Egypt, represented by
Typhon.
" These Mysteries, whatever may have been their origin, or
for what purposes they were then instituted, were certainly a
corruption of the original worship of

which these rites were performed and remaining to the
present day, is an evidence of the magnitude of that system...
" The caverns of Salsette, of which there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred,

different ranges of apartments are connected by open
galleries, and only by private entrances could the most secret
caverns, which contained the ineffable symbols, be
approached, and so curiously contrived as to give the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

A cubical cisia, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for the periodical sepulture of the
aspirant, was located in the most secret recesses of the cavern.
The consecrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> of absolution was held in a carved
basin in every cavern, and on the surface floated the flowers
of the lotus. The Linga or Phallus appeared everywhere most
conspicuous, and oftentimes in situations too disgusting to be
mentioned...
" Sacrifices to the sun, to the planets, and to household
gods, were made accompanied with ablutions of water,
purifications with dung and urine of the cow. This last was
because the dung was the medium by which the soil was made
fertile and reminded them of the doctrine of ' Corruption and
reproduction ' taught in the worship of Siva. "

is Jacolliot who gives the following description of perverted

" The Fakirs appear to have gradually monopolized all the

Brahmins, seeking to justify the method whereby the control
of the masses is vested in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of a few, when preaching
in the pagodas, even now say : " See how logical is this system
of division of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> into castes. It was formed in the

but taking no action himself. This is the Brahmin priest

appropriate to his station in life.
" Another very important function appears however to have
been early assigned to him, on which much more stress is laid
in his (Siva) modern worship — that of destroyer — viz., the
character of a generative power, symbolized in the phallic
emblem (Linga) and in the sacred bull (Nandi), the favourite
attendant of the god. This feature being entirely alien from the

plausibility, that the Linga-worship was originally prevalent
among the non-Aryan population, and was thence introduced
into the worship of Siva. 7

One of the most curious facts in the Theocratic System
ruling India is that the principle of equality is evidenced only
in the teaching and practice of Occultism. Members of all
castes are admitted on the same footing to learn magic or
fakirism and compose the class known under the name of
Fakirs. This system of equality is similar to the brotherhood
principle and teaching of democracy advocated in
Freemasonry which was so effectively exploited in all the
lodges that fomented the French Revolution.
" As all castes are admitted to the congregation of the
Fakirs, the lowest of the soudras on entering it becomes the
equal of the Brahmins. In spreading the belief that whosoever
consented to enrol among the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> initiates of the pagoda, and
to die for the faith, was transported to the abode of Brahma
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> accomplishing further migration on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or having to
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> through hell, the Brahmins provided for an inexhaustible
supply of fakirs. "
" Before entering the category of fakir, those who are
destined to illustrate the ceremonies of the cults by their
tortures and death, the new recruits practise the occult
sciences under the direction of initiated Brahmins in the
innermost recesses of the pagodas. "
While " there are indeed extraordinary phenomena in what
is termed by the Brahmins occult science, there are none
which cannot be explained and which are not in accordance
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of nature. "
" To become expert in magic, like the believers in the
philosophic doctrine of the Pitris, the pupil must learn, from a
magician whom the sorcerers <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> their Guru, the formulas of
evocation, by means of which the malign spirits are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>

ference to others, probably on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their willingness to
do anything that may be required of them. "
" An intimate connection exists between the doctrine of the
ancient Jewish Cabalists and those of the Hindu votaries of
the Pitris — or spirits — <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> scientific <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> is the
Agrouchada-parikchai. 8
" It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be impossible to enumerate the different drugs,
ingredients and implements that compose the stock-in-trade
of a magician. " 9
The standard Indian <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on magic is the Oupnek'hat.
Therein is to be found a detailed description of methods
available for producing catalepsy, somnambulism,
hallucination and ecstasy by strength of will and fatigue of the
nervous system. 10
This is what is known to the modern common-sense mortal
as " Yogi stuff ", and it is mostly based on breathing
exercises.
We will now quote from Mr. Sellon :
" It is a little remarkable that of the host of Divinities,
especially in Bengal, Siva is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> whom they are
especially delighted to honour. As the Destroyer, and one who
revels in cruelty and bloodshed, this terrible deity, who has
not inaptly been compared to the Moloch of Scripture, of all
their Divinities suggests most our idea of the Devil. It may
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be concluded that the most exalted notion of
worship among the Hindus is a service of Fear. The Brahmins
say that the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and benevolent, and will not
hurt their creatures, but that Siva is powerful and cruel, and
that it is necessary to appease him.

" Although this deity is sometimes represented in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in his images, it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that he is most
frequently adored. The most popular representation of him is
unquestionably the Linga ; a smooth stone rising out of
another stone of finer texture, simulacrum membri virilis, et
pudendum muliebre. This emblem is identical with Siva in his
capacity of 'Lord of all.' n
" It is necessary, however, to observe here that Professor
Wilson, while admitting that ' the Linga is perhaps the most
ancient <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of homage adopted in India', adds, '
subsequently to the ritual of the Vedhas, which was chiefly, if
not wholly, addressed to the Elements, and particularly to fire.
How far the worship of the Linga is authorized by the Vedhas
is doubtful, but that it is the main purport of several of the
Puranas there can be no doubt.' 12
" The worship of Siva under the type of the Linga is almost
the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> in which that deity is reverenced. Its prevalence

sufficiently conspicuous. In Bengal, the Lingam Temples are
commonly erected in a range of six, eight, or twelve on each
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of a Ghaut leading to the river. At Kalma is a circular
group of one hundred and eight temples erected by the Rajah
of Burdwan. These temples, and indeed all those found in
Bengal, consist of a simple chamber of a square <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
surmounted by a pyramidal centre ; the area of each is very
small. The Linga of black or white marble, and sometimes of
alabaster slightly tinted and gilt, is placed in the middle. " 13

" Bacchus or Osiris was represented by an equilateral
triangle, and the sectarian mark of the worshippers of Siva is

that which is paid to Siva, it had the same obscenities, the
same cruel bloodthirsty rites, and the same emblem of the
generative power. 15
" Durga, Kali, or Maha Kali as the Sacti, spouse or
energetic will of Siva, the destructive power, bears a
remarkable analogy with the Moloch of Scripture, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as

" The Ghoculasthas adore Krishna, while the Ramani
worship Rama ; both have again branched into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sects —
one consists of the exclusive worshippers of Krishna, and
these only are deemed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> and orthodox Vaishnavas... As
Parameswarra, Krishna is represented of a black or dark blue
colour. Now the Tulasi is the black Ocymum, and all animals
or vegetables of a black or blue colour are sacred to him. His
linga also is always either black or dark blue, and may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be
distinguished from that of Siva, which is generally white.
" This divinity, as Parameswarra, is Janan'nauth
(Juggernaut), or ' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the Universe ', and it is under the
wheels of his sacred car that so many misguided <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
annually immolated themselves.
" To return, however, to the Vaishnavas. Another of their
sects adore Krishna and his mistress Radha united. These are
the Lingionijas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> worship is perhaps the most <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of all
the Pujas. A third, the Radha-ballubhis, dedicate their
offerings to Radha only. The followers of these last
mentioned sects have adopted the singular practice of
presenting to a naked girl the oblation intended for the
Goddess, constituting her the living impersonation of Radha.
Rut when a female is not to be obtained for this purpose, the
votive offerings are made to an image of the Yoni, or emblem
of the feminine power. These worshippers are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

Yonijas, in contradistinction to the Lingayats, or adorers of
the Krishna (Vishnu) Linga.
" As the Saivas are all worshippers of Siva and Bowannee
(Pavati) conjointly, so the Vaishnavas also offer up their
prayers to Laksmi-Nayarana. The exclusive adorers of this
Goddess are the Sactas.
" The caste mark of the Saivas and Sactas consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

possible, from the hearth on which a consecrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> is
perpetually maintained. The adoration of the Sacti is quite in
accordance with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the mythological system of the
Hindus. It has been computed that, of the Hindus in Bengal, at
least three-fourths are Sactas, of the remaining fourth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

" Independently of the homage paid to the principal Deities,
there are a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> variety of inferior beings, Dewtas, and
demi-gods of a malevolent character and formidable aspect,
who receive the worship of the multitude. The bride of Siva,
however, in one or other of her many and varied forms, is by
far the most popular goddess in Bengal and along the Ganges.
" The worship of the female generative principle, as
distinct from the Divinity, appears to have originated in the
literal interpretation of the metaphorical language of the
Vedhas, in which Will, or purpose to Create the Universe, is
represented as originating from the Creator and co-existent
with him as his bride, and part of himself. "
" Although the adoration of the Sacti (the personified
energy of the Omnipotent) is authorized by some of the
Puranas, the rites and formulae are more clearly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in a

" The followers of the Tantras profess to consider them as a
fifth Vedh, and attribute to them equal antiquity
and
superior authority. "
" The Tantras are too numerous to specify them further,
but the curious reader will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> them under the heads of
Syama Rahasya, Anandra, Rudra, Yamala, Mandra,
Mahodahi, Sareda, Tilika, and Kalika-Tantras.
" Although any of the goddesses may be objects of the
Sacta worship, and the term Sacti comprehends them all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
the homage of the Sactas is almost restricted, in Bengal, to the
consort of Siva. The Varnis, or Vamacharis, worship Devi as

of the Tantras.
" According to the immediate <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the worshipper is
the particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of worship ; but all the forms require the
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of some or all of the five Makaras — Mansa, Matsya,
Madya, Maithuna, and Mudra — that is : flesh, fish, wine,
women, and certain mystical gesticulations with the fingers.
Suitable Muntrus, or incantations, are also indispensable,
according to the end proposed, consisting of various
unmeaning monosyllabic combinations of letters, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

solitude is enjoined, but all the principal ceremonies
comprehend the worship of Sacti, or Power, and require, for
that purpose, the presence of a young and beautiful girl, as the
living representative of the goddess. This worship is mostly
celebrated in a mixed <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> ; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of which represent
Bhairavas, or Viras, and the women, Bhanravis and Nayikas.
The Sacti is personified by a naked girl, to whom meat and
wine are offered, and then distributed among the assistants.
Here follows the chanting of the Muntrus and sacred texts, and
the performance of the Mudra, or gesticulations with the
fingers. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> terminates with orgies amongst the
votaries of a very licentious description. This ceremony is
entitled the Sri Chakra or Purna-bisheka, The Ring or <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span>
Initiation. 20
" This method of adoring the Sacti is unquestionably
acknowledged by the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> regarded by the Vanis as
authorities for the impurities practised.
" The members of the sect are sworn to secrecy, and will
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> acknowledge any participation in Sacta-Puja.

and at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they trouble themselves very little to
disguise their initiation into its mysteries, but they do not
divulge in what those mysteries consist.
" The Kauchiluas are another branch of the Sactas sect;
their worship much resembles that of the Caulas. They are,
however, distinguished by one particular rite not practised by
the others, and throw into confusion all the ties of female
relationship ; natural restraints are wholly disregarded, and a
community of "women among the votaries inculcated.

worship, the women and girls deposit their " julies ", or
bodices, in a box in charge of the Guru, or priest. At the close
of the rites, the male worshippers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> each a " julie " from the
box, and the female to whom it belongs, even were she his
sister, becomes his partner for the evening in these lascivious
orgies.
" In every temple of any importance in India we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a
troupe of Nautch or dancing girls attached.
" These women are generally procured when quite young,
and are early initiated into all the mysteries of their profession.
They are instructed in dancing and vocal and instrumental
music, their chief employment being to chant the sacred
hymns, and perform nautches before the God, on the
recurrence of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> festivals. But this is not the only service
required of them, for besides being the acknowledged
mistresses of the officiating priests, it is their duty to
prostitute themselves in the courts of the temple to all comers,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> raise funds for the enrichment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of worship
to which they belong... A Nautch woman esteems it a peculiar
privilege to become the Radha Dea on such occasions. It is an
office indeed which these adepts are, on every account, better
calculated to fulfil with satisfaction to the sect of Sacteyas,
who require their aid, than a more innocent and
unsophisticated girl.
" The worship of Sacti is the adoration of Power, 21 which
the Hindus typify by the Yoni, or womb, the Argha or vulva,
and by the leaves and flowers of certain plants <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> to

Heckethorn tells us that the Maharajas constitute another

As regards the sect of Kali's worshippers, Hecke-thorn
gives the following details :
" A newly admitted member takes the appellation of
Sahib-Zada. He commences his infamous career as lughah, or
gravedigger, or as belhal, or explorer of the spots most
convenient for executing a projected assassination, or bhil. In

abundant proof of his ability and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will. He is then raised
to the degree of Bhuttotah, or strangler, which advancement,
however, is preceded by new formalities and ceremonies. On

is pronounced a perfect bhuttotah. He binds himself by fearful

The political significance of such a sect in any Theoc-rasy
can be easily understood when one realizes what it means to
the rulers of a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> to have at their disposal a staff of fanatics

MAZDEISM
(Zoroastrianism)

While the origin of Mazdeism seems shrouded in mystery,
one may nevertheless recognize its antiquity, probably the
same as that of the Rig-Vedha, for it has been proved by
Eugene Bournouf and Spiegel that certain parts of the Avesta
are as old as the Rig, and the many similarities of this religion
with that of the Vedhas proves that Mazdeism must have had
its origin at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the Aryans undertook the conquest
of India, that is to say seventeen to eighteen centuries before
our era.
From Le Mazdeisme, I'avesta of G. de Lafont, we extract
the following facts : l The historic role of Media began with
Ouwakshatara, a name <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by the Greeks Kyouxares, the
founder of the Median empire. After defeating the Scythians,
Kyouxares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Assyria where he laid siege to Nineveh,
after the destruction of which the Assyrian empire came to an
end. (612 B. C.)
Kyouxares <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Astyage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> daughter Man-dane

empire.
The Parthian dynasty of the Arsacides, who reigned from
256 B. C. until 226 A. D., marks a fatal period for Mazdeism.
It was only on the accession of Ardeschir Babejan, the
founder of the Sassanide dynasty, that Mazdeism regained its
strength. With Ardeshir, Mazdeism became the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> religion
and Shapour II caused all the Avesta <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> treating of
philosophy, medicine, cosmogony and astronomy to be
collected.
Under the last Sassanides appeared several heretical sects,
the most celebrated of which were those of Manes and of
Mazdeck. However, in the seventh century, came the Arab
conquest; with Yesdegirt the Persian empire of the
Sassanides disappeared and with it the influence of
Mazdeism.
Towards the tenth century, a few <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Persians,
faithful to the old cult, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> into exile taking with them their
laws and altars. Some of these <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> refuge in the Kirman in
the Yezd while the others fled to India where they now
constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known sect of the Parsees.
The Zend Avesta, the sacred <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of Persia and of the
modern Parsees, contains the teaching of Zoroaster
(Zarathustra), a reformer, said to have lived some 7000 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
before Christ. It was first translated into French by
Hyacinthe-Anquetil Duperron in 1761.
The Chevalier de Ramsay, giving Plutarch as his authority,
says : — " Zoroaster taught that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> contrary

he calls Oro-mazes, (Ahura-Mazda) the other the Daemon
Arima-nius (Agra-Mainyus). He says that the one resembles

justice and truth. "
For the benefit of the reader we compile the following
interesting information from the previously mentioned author,
G. de Lafont :
Pure Zoroastrianism was monotheistic, for in the beginning
Ahura-Mazda was recognized as infinitely more powerful
than Agra-Mainyus, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> dualism, or the potential equality of

corruption of the Zoroas-trian teaching.
The Avesta, the bible of Mazdeism, containing the
revelations of Ahura-Mazda to the Prophet Zoroaster, is
composed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal parts — the Avesta, containing the
Vendidad, the Yacnca and the Vispered, and the Khorda
Avesta, or little Avesta, itself composed of six parts.
Mazdeism taught the immortality of the soul, a

on the Altar.
The Fravashis (modern Ferouers) are supposed to be the
souls of the dead deified. Their cult also forms the basis of the
Ancestor worship, of the Pitris of India and the Manes of
Latin Countries.
According to Geiger, by " Fravashis " must be understood
the immortal, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> part in man, which unites with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for

who are dead, of those who are living, and of those who are
still unborn. Darmstater further explains that the Fravashis are

offered to the Ferouers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> the choice of remaining in the

At the advent of death, corpses were supposed immediately
to become the prey of the Demon Druge Nacus, the demon of
the impurity of corpses. Thus, it being most essential never to

Their ancient customs persist today among the Parsees of
India where the bodies of the dead are carried to " The Towers
of Silence " there to be exposed and devoured by the birds of
prey.
Besides the many other parallels between Mazdeism and
Christianity, the deity of the Mazdeans, their personal God,
Ahura-Mazda, was not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of vengeance as was the

last of the prophets of the Jains and a contemporary of
Buddha.
Vardhamana Mahavira died at the age of 72 at Pava 527 B.
C. He had eleven disciples to whom he preached the law.
Many authorities however believe the Jain Church to be as
old as Brahminism itself.
The following paragraph quoted from Hastings'
Encyclopaedia of Religions and Ethics, article on Jainism,
describes the Jain theory of the Transmigration of Souls as
opposed to the orthodox theory of Reincarnation. It is here
referred to as " a peculiarity of the Jains which had struck all
observers more than any other, viz. their extreme carefulness
not to destroy any living being, a principle which is carried
out to its very last consequences in monastic life, and has
shaped the conduct of the laity in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> measure.

strict vegetarians. This principle of not hurting any living
being bars them from some professions, e. g. agriculture, and
has thrust them into commerce and especially into its least
elevating branch of money-lending. Most of the money
lending in Western India is in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the Jains, and this
accounts in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> measure both for their unpopularity and for
their wealth. A remarkable institution of the Jains, due to their
tender regard for animal life, is their asylums for old and
diseased animals, the pan-jarapolas, where they are kept and
fed till they die a natural death. "
The reluctance on the part of an orthodox Jain to discourage
vermin on the theory that a louse may actually be his
reincarnated grandmother or a scorpion some other
reincarnated relative is only a logical development of his
religious belief in the transmigration of souls.
The Jains are subdivided today into numerous schools each
following the teachings of a certain <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> but united in
certain fundamental beliefs.

communication with the Sublime Sovereign or God. The rites
had nothing of a religious character, they were purely social.
Then in 1122 B. C, when the Chinese dynasty of Chang-Yin

China numerous innovations, most of them appertaining to

with the erroneous belief prevalent among the non-Jews that
Judaism is a religion.
In spite of the loud and frequent assertions, made by Jews

The closer one studies the history of the Jews, the clearer it

The absolute failure of Zionism which

bind all the Jews of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> into a national entity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

such an effort.
Judaism is not a religion and the Jews are not a nation, but
they are a sect with Judaism as a rite.
The obligations and rules of the rite for the Jewish masses
are contained in the Talmud and Schulchan Aruk, but the
esoteric teachings for the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> initiates are to be found in
the Cabala.
Therein are contained the mysterious rites for evocations,
the indications and keys to practices for conjuration of
supernatural forces, the science of numbers, astrology, etc.
The practical application of the Cabalist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is

over the masses. Sovereigns and Popes, both, usually had one
or more Jews as astrologers and advisers, and they frequently
gave Jews control over their very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by employing them as

Munk leave no doubt on the point that the sect appeared
during the period of the captivity.
" From then dates the Cabala or Tradition of the Pharisees.

The Pharisees were, as it were, a class <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> tendency was

first, they formed a sort of brotherhood, a haburah, the
members being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> haburim or brothers. They were a
subversive element, aiming at the overthrow of the
Sadducean High-priesthood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> members prided
themselves on their aristocracy of blood and birth, to which
the Pharisees opposed an aristocracy of learning. The war
waged by the latter extends over a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of time, and
the rivalry was bitter. The Pharisees, who, although they
professed, as one of their chief tenets, the utmost contempt of
the am-haretz or simple people, did not overlook the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that
they needed their mass support for the attainment of their own
aim, and they enlisted it by opposing the Sadducean strictness
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in many instances, namely, in the observance of

Temple by Titus and thenceforth the Pharisaic element held
supremacy among the Jews.

Quoting an acknowledged authority on Judaism, Mr.
Flavien Brenier, Lt. Gen. Netchvolodow further describes the
policy of the sect as follows : 2
" Before appearing proudly as the expression of Jewish
aspirations, The Tradition of the Pharisees had serious
difficulties to surmount, the chief of which was the revival of
the orthodox <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> stimulated in the Jewish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> by the
Captivity. To the exiles, bemoaning the fall of the Temple of
<span class="t28 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> and begging Jehovah to end the misfortunes of
their homeland, the revelation that Jehovah was only a
phantom, entailed not only certain defeat, but also their own
exposure to perils the least of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been the loss
of all authority over Israel.
" The Pharisees then, judging it wiser to capture the
confidence of their compatriots by taking the lead of the
religious movement, affected a scrupulous observance of the
slightest prescriptions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> and instituted the practice of
complicated rituals, simultaneously however cultivating the
new doctrine in their secret sanctuaries. These were regular
secret societies, composed during the captivity of a few hundred adepts. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Flavius Josephus which was that of
their greatest prosperity they numbered only some 6,000
members.
" This group of intellectual pantheists was soon to acquire a
directing influence over the Jewish nation. Nothing, moreover,
likely to offend national sentiment ever appeared in their
doctrines. However saturated with pantheistic Chaldeism they
might have been, the Pharisees preserved their ethnic pride
intact. This religion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> divinised, which they had

profit of the Jew, the superior and predestined being. The
promises of universal dominion which the orthodox Jew
found in the Law, the Pharisees did not interpret in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of the reign of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> over the nations, but in that
of a material domination to be imposed on the universe by the
Jews. The awaited Messiah was no longer the Redeemer of

wheels of his chariot'. The Pharisees did not ask this
enslavement of the nations of a mystical Jehovah, which they
continued worshipping in public, only as a concession to
popular opinion, for they expected its eventual consummation
to be achieved by the secular patience of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Israel</span> and the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of

principles as these, but they had nothing one could see, which
might have rendered unpopular those who let them filter, drop
by drop, among the Jews.
" The admirably conceived organization of the Pharisees
did not fail soon to bear fruit.
" One cannot better define its action in the midst of Jewish
<span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> before <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> Christ, " said Mr. Fla-vien Brenier, " than
in comparing it with that of the Freemasons in modern
society. "
" A carefully restricted membership tightly bound,
imposing on their members the religion of ' the secret', the
Pharisees pursued relentlessly their double aim which was :
—
1. The seizure of political power, by the possession of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> political offices (the influence of which was tremendous
in the reconstituted Jewish nation) and the conquest of the
Sanhedrin (Jewish parliament).

The first of these aims was achieved when Hillel, a
Pharisee of Babylon who claimed Davidic descent, was
elected president of the Sanhedrin. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> ended the bitter fight

Exoteric Judaism, the Jewish religion as practised in the
twentieth century, is based on the Old Testament, and on
equally ancient commentaries on it, preserved for ages as oral
traditions, and known, as above stated, under the general
name of The Talmud. All copies of this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> were ordered to
be burned by Philip IV, the Fair, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of France, in 1306, but

One follows the evolution of Greece from Orpheus to
Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato and one searches for the
remnants of Egyptian esoterism in the utmost recesses of the
Delphic temples and in the ceremonies of initiation to the
Eleusinian mysteries. These, having still been practised until
the Emperor Theodosius I, the Great, (379-395) prohibited
them and ordered the destruction of the Eleusinian Temple,
much material is available for their description.
We are indebted to Bishop Lavington, an erudite member

" Much more might be collected (even from initiated

Origin of the Mysteries, which I <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> over.....
" The celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries commenced

" One contrivance for ' giving the Initiated a Sight of the

ran wildly into the System of an universal Doubt, and carried
it almost to such an Excess of Frenzy, that they doubted of the

THE DRUIDS

We heard, in 1928, of a " Druid " celebration at Stonehenge.
Shortly afterwards we read of another, an initiation ceremony,
at Penzance where "12 bards of Britain, including Sir Arthur
Quiller-Couch, the author, were initiated by the Archdruid of
Wales into a sect revived after a lapse of 2000 years. " l
Some of us might prefer the lapse to have continued and as
the subject of the Druid Mysteries is here relevant we quote
verbatim the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> entitled " The Druids " from Mr. Charles
William Heckethorn's interesting <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Secret Societies of All

" The secret doctrines of the Druids were much the same as
those of the Gymnosophists and Brahmins of India, the Magi
of Persia, the priests of Egypt, and of all other priests of

Kit Cotey's House, in Kent, was such a pastos. Considerable
space, however, was necessary for the machinery of initiation
in its largest and most comprehensive scale. Therefore, the
Coer Sidi, where the mysteries of Druidism were performed,
consisted of a range of buildings, adjoining the temple,
containing apartments of all sizes, cells, vaults, baths, and

terror <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> on these occasions. Most frequently these places
were subterranean.
" The system of Druidism embraced every religious and

bore an undoubted reference to astronomical facts. Their
chief deities are reducible to two, — a male and a female, the

May-eve, when fires were kindled on all the cairns and
cromlechs throughout the island, which burned all night to
introduce the sports of May-day, whence all the national
sports formerly or still practised, date their origin. Round
these fires choral dances were performed in honour of the sun,
who, at this season, was figuratively said to rise from his
tomb. The festival was licentious, and continued till the
luminary had attained his meridian height, when priests and
attendants retired to the woods, where the most disgraceful
orgies were perpetrated. But the solemn initiations were
performed at midnight, and contained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees, the first

those of Pythagoras.
" Their authority in many cases exceeded that of the
monarch. They were, of course, the sole interpreters of
religion, and consequently superintended all sacrifices; for no

Holocausts of men, women, and children, enclosed in large
towers of wicker-work, were sometimes sacrificed as a
burnt-offering to their superstitions, which were, at the same
time, intended to enhance the consideration of the priests,
who were an ambitious race delighting in blood. The Druids,
it is said, preferred such as had been guilty of theft, robbery,
or other crimes, as most acceptable to their gods; but when
there was a scarcity of criminals, they made no scruple to
supply their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> with innocent persons. These dreadful
sacrifices were offered by the Druids, for the public, on the
eve of a dangerous war, or in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of any national
calamity ; and also for particular persons of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> rank, when
they were afflicted with any dangerous disease.
" The priestesses, clothed in white, and wearing a metal
girdle, foretold the future from the observation of natural
phenomena, but more especially from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> sacrifices. For
them was reserved the frightful task of putting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> the

Druids ; and their auguries were drawn from the manner in
which the blood issued from the many wounds inflicted, and
also from the smoking entrails. Many of these priestesses
maintained a perpetual virginity, others gave themselves up
to the most luxurious excesses.
" As the Romans gained ground in these islands the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

MANICHEISM

Manicheism is the religion of the followers of Manes, a
slave who was sold to a widow who freed and adopted him,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> making him the " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the widow " a name which after
him passed to all his followers and is still <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in Masonic
Lodges.
Of Manicheism, C. W. Olliver, considered an authority on
all masonic matters, writes :
" Manicheism was one of the most important attempts to
found a universal religion and to reconcile the Christian,
Buddhist, and Mazdean with the Greek philosophy. It
presented the same syncretic ideas found later among Moslem
Druzes and among Sikhs. It failed in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> because
Islam presented a much simpler system in the East, and
because in the West Christianity was already developing, in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Manes, a religion which aimed at reconciling the
Paganism of Italy and Gaul with the ethics of Christ, this
presenting a simpler and more familiar faith. But the one
achievement of Manes was the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the Devil which led
to an afterwards unremovable taint throughout religion.
Manes was a notable philosopher and religious teacher <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span>
about the year A. D. 216, and he was crucified and flayed
alive by the Persian

Magi under Bahram I in the year A. D. 277. His Persian name
was Shuraik, rendered Cubricus in Latin. " 1
He was the slave of the wife of a certain Terebinth who
was a disciple of Scythianus of the race of the Sarrasins.
Olliver tells us further that : " His Acta Archdei became the
Manichean Bible with sundry added epistles. He taught the
Mazdean dualism of the powers of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and darkness, as
representing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> beings, and an asceticism which
aimed at the control of all passions. Manes repudiated
Judaism, and like the Gnostics, regarded Jehovah as an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
God. The Mani-cheans were more hated and feared by
Catholic Christians than any other sect. They were still in
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in spite of constant persecution as late as our tenth
century, and their influence was felt from China to Spain and
Gaul. It still lingers in Asia, and among the ' Christians of St.
Thomas ' in Madras it survived till the fifteenth century. St.
Augustine had listened for nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to Manes, but the
Roman Empire felt the force of this system chiefly in A. D.
280. The Romans knew it themselves in A. D. 330, and
Faustus became its missionary among them. Many clung to
Manicheism till A. D. 440, when Leo the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> found that he
must stamp it out if the Roman creed was not to be extinguished. It was the basis of the Paulican heresy, and of that of
the Albigenses in the South of France which was only
quenched by blood in the thirteenth century.
" The doctrine of Manes can be summed up as follows. He
believed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> gods, or, more exactly, principles, the

Manicheism possessed its- dogmas, liturgies, devotees,
and churches.
But again to quote Olliver : " First and foremost amongst
the manifestations of what had become Devil worship we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
the Black Mass or Devil Masses of the Middle Ages, from

character of the benefactor of humanity, and in other instances
Satan, the same spirit, as the Principle of Evil.
This is evident from the various references to their deity adduced
in the trials of persons accused of this heresy. In both cases however,
the devotees, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of Lucifer or Satan, were obliged formally to

goat-headed Baphomet, the latter variously modified but
usually bearing between the horns on its <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> the phallic
emblem of a lighted candle.
Esoterically, this candle symbolized the sex-force or
Kundalini risen to the pineal gland.
Cotton Mather stated that the witches " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> themselves
after the manner of Congregational Churches, " and M. A.
Murray gives the following description of their leader :
" The Chief or supreme <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">Head</span> of each district was known to
the recorders as the ' Devil '. Below him in each district, one
or more officers — according to the size of the district —
were appointed by the chief. The officers might be either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
or women; their duties were to arrange for meetings, to send
out notices, to keep the record of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done, to transact the
business of the community, and to present new members.
Evidently these persons also noted any likely convert, and
either themselves entered into negotiations or reported to the
Chief, who then <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> action as opportunity served. At the
Esbats the officer appears to have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> command in the
absence of the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> ; at the Sabbaths the officers
were merely heads of their own Covens, and were known as
Devils or Spirits, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> recognized as greatly inferior to the

entered the witches' report in his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> ; if he were a priest or
ordained minister, he often performed part of the religious
service ; but the Devil

himself always celebrated the mass or sacrament. "
From Lemoine in La Tradition, published 1892, we learn
that the garter is the distinctive mark of the witch leader, for a
woman shared this honour with the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> as the
Grand Mistress and in some cases occupied the office of
deacon.
Animal masks seem to have been a popular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
disguise adopted by the witches and wizards attending
meetings, and this custom is probably responsible for many
of the stories of witch lycanthropy.
Among other obscene and phallic witch-rites was the
Black Mass, celebrated by a renegade priest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the naked

It
symbolized the perversion of all the rites of the Catholic
church. Black candles instead of white, inverted crosses,
chalices containing the blood of new-born infants sacrificed
for ritual purposes, urine for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> water, all these were part of
the paraphernalia needed, according to historians, to propitiate the Prince of Darkness and his retinue of minor Devils.
Besides evocations, casting of spells and sex-orgies, devil
worship entailed such inanities as desecration of the hosts
stolen from catholic churches and the kissing of the Grand
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> (devil) on the tail or membrum virile.
Only hosts consecrated in Roman Catholic churches could
serve for Black Mass purposes as it was essential, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to
achieve desecration, that the miracle of transubstantiation
should have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> place. The host had actually to be, not
merely to represent, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and blood of Christ.

and they impede the conjugal action of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women. "
Eliphas Levi, in Histoire de la Magie, (p. 116) gives the
following explanation of the supposed origin of " elementals "
known by spiritists as " dwellers on the threshold. "
He states that; " according to the best authorities, these
spirits (larves) possess an ethereal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> formed of the vapour
of blood. That is why they seek blood and why they were
supposed, formerly, to feed on the smoke of sacrifices.
" They are the Incubi and Succubi, the monstrous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span>
of impure dreams.
" When sufficiently condensed to be visible, they are only a
vapour coloured by the reflection of a picture and, having no
independent life, they imitate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of him who evokes
them as the shadow does the body.
" They generally manifest around the persons of idiots and
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> devoid of morality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> isolation has led them to
develop irregular habits.
" Owing to the feeble cohesion of the parts of their fantastic
bodies, they <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> the open air, fire, and above all, the point of
swords, and as they live only by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of those who have
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> or evoked them, they become the vaporous
appendices of the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of their parents. So it can happen
that an injury inflicted on them might actually react <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
parent body, as the unborn child is really wounded or
disfigured by an impression made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its mother.
" These elementals draw the vital heat from persons in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> health and quickly exhaust those who are weak.
" They are the source of the stories of vampires, stories
only too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> and periodically recurrent, as everyone knows.

" That is why one feels a chill of the atmosphere when
approaching mediums who are persons obsessed by these
spirits that never manifest in the presence of anyone able to
unveil the mystery of their monstrous birth. They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span>
of an exalted imagination or unbalanced mentality... "
In politics, throughout the ages, witchcraft, as practised by
subversive sects, has played a prominent part.
Illustrations of this are to be found in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the North
Berwick Witches who were tried for treason in 1592 when
their Devil or Grand Master, Francis Stewart, Earl of
Bothwell, attempted to supplant James VI as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of
Scotland. The Black Masses held by the infamous Abbe
Guibourg for Madame de Mon-tespan, with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
regaining for her the favour of Louis XIV, are famous in
history.
Eliphas Levi, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> initiate, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> defined the aims of
magic and witchcraft :
" To deceive the peoples for the purpose of exploiting them,
to enslave them and delay their progress, or prevent it even if
possible, such is the crime of black
ii 4

magic.
Proof of the foregoing devil worship and contact with
spirits or devils is found in history, even as late as 1819 when
we read that; " The Devil met Margaret Nin-Gilbert etc... "
Studying the history of the Mopses in 1761 we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> its Grand
Masters, Grand Mistresses and Deacons, adorned with the
distinctive " Garter " of the witch, performing the ceremonial
of kissing the Devil's tail as part of the ritual of 18th Century
Masonry. The "Coven" of the Middle Ages is the Masonic '
Lodge " of today, but the " Craft " remains the " Craft ".

THE GNOSTICS
(The Heretics)

Gnosticism, like the Ancient Mysteries, was founded on
Spiritism, their mediums giving instructions purporting to
come from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> or Spirits.
In the Christian era, one of the earliest prominent Gnostics
was Simon Magus, a Jew and an adept of the sect of
Dosithians.
This article is composed of certain passages transcribed
verbatim from The Moravians Compared and Detected by
Lavington. (See pages XIII, 59, 105 to 109 and 133).
Among the successive disciples of Simon Magus were —
Basilides, Valentinius, Carpocrates, Marcus, Marcion, Cerdo,
Epiphanes, Montanus, etc., and according to Bishop
Lavington, " these were Heretics, and, that they were Heretics
of the worst Kind that ever defiled and disgraced the Christian
Name, is allowed by all Denominations of Christians.
" Some of these lived in the first Century and even in the
Apostles' Days, but the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Century was most fruitful in

certain Women, would, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a Blush, seduce them from

" And to aggravate their wickedness, they esteemed
Copulation as a most sacred Mystery, known only to

LAMAISM

Lamaism was founded about 407 A. D. by a Bodi-satva
called, it is said, Chomschim, in Chinese Boyan-chi-yin, (the
<span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> which reflects the world) on the mountain Bouthala
around which was built the sacred <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa.
Lamaism is not only a religion, it is a theistic government.
In 1206, when Tibet was conquered by Ghengis Khan
(Mongol), Buddhism became the established religion but in
1368 when Tibet fell from the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the Mongols into
those of the Chinese, Lamaism, losing its temporal power,
became merely a religion, its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> remaining
however the same and the religion of more than 250 million
men.
The Lamas are Priests of <span class="t0 t14 t18 t19 t24 hoverable">Buddha</span> among the Mongols and
Tibetans, but Lamaism is not orthodox Buddhism.
Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, laid down the
following laws governing the attainment of Nirvana (state of
not being). Their enumeration will serve to show how
Buddhism and Lamaism differ.
According to that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher the ten obstacles which

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of tulkous. Soon all monasteries made a point of
having at their <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> the incarnation of some celebrated
personage. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the Dalai-Lama, the political <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of Tibet
today, is said still to be a reincarnation of Tchenrezigs and the
present Trachi Lama one of Eupamed. " 6
The palace of the Dalai-Lamas is the monastery of Gahlden
situated some twenty kilometres from Lhassa. It was founded
by Tsong Khapa in the XV century. Tsong Khapa, the
reformer, forbade marriage and the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of fermented
beverages to the clergy. His followers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gelougspas are

their red hats, are their religious opponents.
As regards the Tibetan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and the ritual pertaining to
their worship Madame David-Neel gives us the following
most illuminating description :
" To the respiratory exercises repeated several times a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
the recluse often joins meditation-contemplation assisted by
Kyilkhors.
" A Kyilkhor, or magic circle, is a kind of diagram drawn
on paper or stuff or engraved on metal, stone or wood...
Deities or lamas are generally represented on them by little
pyramids of paste <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ' torma. ' 7
" Kyilkhors are also designed with coloured powder on
boards or on the floor, but only such persons as have
received a special initiation may compose or

draw them. Each Kyilkhor, moreover, requires a particular
initiation and that erected by a non-initiate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain a
dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> impossible to animate and powerless. An
advanced student, wishing to evoke a Bodhisatva or deity,
seeks to animate the Kyilkhor which has hitherto only served
as a focus for concentration.
" The Hindus endow magical diagrams as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the
statues of deities with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> before worshipping them. The
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of this rite, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prana-pratishtha, is to convey to the
inanimate object, by means of psychic currents, the energy of
the worshipper. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> infused into the latter is kept up
by the daily cult which is rendered it, for it lives on the
concentration of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> which has given it birth. Should it
suddenly be deprived of this subtle food, the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

to its former condition of inert matter. " 8
The Tibetan mystics animate their Kyilkhor by a similar
method, but they do not aim at making it an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of worship
and the material representation of the Kyilkhor is abolished
when, after a certain amount of practice, it becomes purely a
mental image.
A tradition of the Kahgyudpas relates that the founder of
their sect, Marpa, was blamed by his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> (guru) Narota for
having paid homage first to the Kyilkhor.
" It is I who constructed the Kyilkhor ", declared Narota. "

OCCULT THEOCRASY

" According to Tibetan occultists, these beings, (the gods)
have acquired a kind of real <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> due to the innumerable
thoughts which have been concentrated on them 10.
" According to the Tibetans, during the celebration of a rite,
the thoughts of the officiating evocator, concentrated on the
deities who ' exist already ', cause these to become more
powerful and more real for him. By identifying himself with
them the evocator establishes contact with an accumulation of
energy infinitely greater than that which he alone might
generate. "n
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we must conclude that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of Eastern Magic
correspond to what our occidental scientists <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span>
thought-forms. That these thought-forms can be projected
and reabsorbed into the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of their creator is a theory with
which all students of spiritism and psychic science are
familiar, but that they can detach from their makers and lead
separate existences, empowered for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> by the

an emaciated Yogi alone in a hut in the middle of the forest.

THE YEZIDEES (DEVIL WORSHIPPERS)

The sect of the Yezidees was founded by Sheik Adi in the
fifth century.
Mr. W. B. Seabrook's observations on the Yezidees, as
recorded in his book, Adventures in Arabia, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a basis for
the study of the beliefs of this sect.
According to his informant, the Yezidee <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> is briefly
this : l

after another ', and the first of these spirits was Satan, whom
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> made supreme ruler of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> for a period of ten
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> years. And because Satan was supreme <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of
the earth, those who dwelt on it could prosper only by doing
him homage and worshipping him.
" Since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> name was forbidden ", Mechmed Hamdi
told me, " they referred to Shaitan as Melek Taos (Angel
Peacock) and worshipped him in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a brass bird ..."
While the name of Shaitan was forbidden ", he said, " so
much so that if a Yezidee hears it spoken, their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>

about Melek Taos as we could to a Christian about Jesus. "
A priest of the cult also volunteered the following
information to Mr. Seabrook on the Yezidee divinity.
" Our difference from all other religions is this — that we
know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is so far away that we can have no contact with

or worship Him. He cares nothing about us.
" He has given the entire control of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for ten

therefore, we worship. Moslems and Christians are wrongly

The sacred <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of Islamism, the Koran, was devoid of
mystic teaching. The Figh, for every believer, is the code of
morals and obligations such as fast, prayer, pilgrimage to
Mecca, etc. Mysticism was interjected into Islamism by
Sufism.
Mahomet aimed at the establishment of a religion which,
he declared, was revealed to him during periods of trance
which he frequently underwent. He was determined to
impose this religion on all the Arabs and, through much
bloodshed, he succeeded in stamping out the Koraishites

LODGE OF CAIRO

Manicheism was not the only secret association that sprang
from the initiations of the Magi. In the seventh century of our
era we meet with similar societies, possessing an influence
not limited to the regions in which they arose, variations of
one single thought, which aimed at combining the venerable
doctrines of Zoroaster with Christian belief. Of these
societies or sects the following may be mentioned : the
followers of Keyoumerz; the worshippers of Servan, certain
Zoroastrians, so-called " Dualists " ; Gnostics and, lastly, the
followers of Mastek, the most formidable and disastrous of
all, preaching universal equality and liberty, the
irresponsibility of man, and the community of property and
women.
The Arabs having rendered themselves masters of Persia in
the seventh century, the sects of that country <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to

This is corroborated by Heckethorn who writes :
" The Persian sects examined the Koran, pointed out its
contradictions, and denied its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> origin. And so

there arose in Islamism that movement which attacks dogmas,
and destroys faith, and substitutes for blind belief <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>

In Persia and in Mesopotamia had spread the new
rationalism, the philosophical heresy of the Mutazi-lites
(schismatics) exposed by Hassan al-Basri.
The Jew Abdallah Ibn Saba 2 presented himself as the
prophet of the future Imam, who was to manifest. He meant
to overthrow the caliphate and to uphold the rights of
Mahomet al-Hanafi, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Ismael, the descendant of the

founded the Shi'a sect.
The Fatmite dynasty (from Fatima, daughter of Mahomet)
was founded in 909 A. D. when Ahmed-Said, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of a
Jewess who had married the Shi'a chief al-Hussain,3
conquered <span class="t28 hoverable">Egypt</span> and Syria, establishing the centre at Cairo.
Declaring himself to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> expected Imam, Said, on
coming to power, assumed the name of Obaid Allah el-Mahdi.

The Fatmite dynasty lasted from 909 to 1171. Heckethorn
informs us that " The Doial-Doat, or supreme missionary or
judge, shared the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> with the prince. 5
" Meetings were held in the Lodge at Cairo, which
contained many books and scientific instruments; science was
the professed object, but the real aim was very different. The
course of instruction was divided into nine degrees... the ninth
degree... as the necessary result of the teaching of all the
former, taught that nothing was to be believed, and that
everything was lawful.

OCCULT THEOCRASY

" Egypt, especially, seems as if predestined to be the
birthplace of secret societies, of priests, warriors and fanatics.
It is the region of mysteries... Cairo has succeeded the ancient
Memphis, the doctrine of the Lodge of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> that of the
Academy of Heliopolis... The throne of the descendants of
Fatima was to be surrounded with an army of assassins, a
formidable body-guard; a mysterious militia was to be raised,
that should spread far and wide the fame and terror of the
caliphate of Cairo, and inflict fatal blows on the abhorred rule
of Bagdad. The missionaries spread widely, and in Arabia and
Syria, partisans were won, to whom the designs of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
were unknown, but who had with fearful solemnity sworn
blind obedience. "
The Fatmites had received from the sect the mission of
destroying, or at least of disrupting Islam. The successor of
Obaid-Allah continued this work, having himself proclaimed
a Shi'a while in reality he was sceptic. It was under the Caliph
Hakim that the Druses came into being.
The Shi'a sects who recognized Mohammed al-Hanafi as
the last living " Imam " were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ismae-lites or Septimans.
From their midst sprang a secret body, the Khoja, which, in
spite of persecution still exists in Persia and India, where its
exoteric chief is the Anglicised Indian, the Aga Khan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
followers are the moneylenders of Islam, a profession
forbidden by Mahomet.
Still another Shi'a sect, the Duodecimans or Ima-nites,
recognize Mohamed al-Muntazar the twelfth Imam.
Under the Fatmite Caliph Hakim, a new religion sprang out
of Ismailism, that of the Druses, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from its inventor, a

DRUSES

The Druses, as afore stated, are a gnostic sect among the
Ismaelite Mahommedans. It was founded in the tenth century
during the reign of the Fatimite Caliph al-Hakim
Biambellalu.
The founder is usually recognised as Mohammed al Darazi
or al Druzi (Nouchtegin ben Ismail al Bokhari) <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> near
Bokhara cir. 960. He adopted the doctrine then preached by

ending with the statement that the last living manifestation
was al-Hakim, the Caliph of Egypt. So pleased was al-Hakim
with the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mohammed al-Druzi to him, and

time, al-Hakim who hitherto had been known as Biambellalu

THE ROSICRUCIANS

Speculation has been rife as to the origin of the
Rosicrucians, and the many fables and legends connected
with the subject have but little historical value.
Owing to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> discrepancy between the information
contained in the following article and that given in the more
modern editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, it has been
deemed advisable to reprint the former. (See Enc. Brit., 3r
Edition, Vol. 16, year MDCCXCVII (1797) Edinburgh. Bell
and Macfarquhar.)
" Rosicrucians, a name assumed by a sect or cabal of
hermetical philosophers ; who arose, as it has been said, or at
least became first <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> notice of in Germany, in the
beginning of the fourteenth century. They bound themselves
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by a solemn secret, which they all swore inviolably
to preserve : and obliged themselves, at their admission into
the order, to a strict observance of certain established rules.
They pretended to know all sciences, and chiefly medicine :
whereof they published themselves the restorers. They
pretended to be masters of abundance of important secrets,
and, among others, that of the philosopher's stone : all which
they affirmed to have received by tradition from the ancient
Egyptians, Chaldeans, the Magi, and Gymnosophists.

They have been distinguished by several names, accommodated to the several branches of their doctrine. Because

them, they have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Invisible Brothers. Their
<span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> is frequently signed by the letters F. R. C. which some
among them interpret fratres roris cocti; it being pretended
that the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of the philosopher's stone is dew concocted,
exalted, etc. Some, who are no friends to free-masonry, make
the present flourishing <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> of free-masons a branch of
Rosicrucians ; or rather the Rosicrucians themselves, under a
new name or relation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is
certain, there are some free-masons who have all the
characters of Rosicrucians ; but how the aera and original of
masonry, and that of Rosicrucianism here fixed
from
Nadaeus, who has <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> expressly on
the subject, conflict, we leave others to judge.....................
Notwithstanding the pretended antiquity of the Rosicrucians,
it is probable that the alchemists, Paracel-sists, ' or
fire-philosophers, who spread themselves through almost all
Europe about the close of the 16th century, assumed about
this period the obscure and ambiguous title of Rosicrucian
brethren, which commanded at first some degree of respect,
as it seemed to be borrowed from the arms of Luther, which
were a cross placed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a rose. But the denomination

This article having been <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in 1747 only hinted at what
the Rose Croix might have been. Subsequent research <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

Before it conquered Freemasonry, which was officially
instituted in 1717, many names were already associated
intimately with this esoteric organization. Among others were
Faustus Socinius, Cesare Cremonini, Michael Maier,
Valentin Andrea, Thomas Vaughan (Philaletes), Charles
Blount, Frede-rich Helvetius, Richard Simon, and Theophilus
Desa-guliers.

The movement was greatly furthered by the impulse given
it when, after the appearance of the Fama Frater-nitatis and
Confessio, a German Alchemist, Michael Maier, an English
Physician, Robert Fludd and a Pietist, Julius Sperber, wrote
treatises in defence or explanation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the Rose
Croix.
It has repeatedly been stated that Michael Maier, who
frequently visited England, was a friend of Robert Fludd. He
was the author of Themis Aurea and Silentium post Clamores,
both Rosicrucian works. His political influence may be
judged from his career. Physician to Rudolf II, he was <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>
by him Count of the Palatinate, and acted as adviser to his
sovereign. In 1609, Rudolf II issued an Imperial Charter
granting religious liberty to the Moravians.5
Masonic authorities <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that Maier, as a Rosicrucian,
changed his official title to Summus Magister, Sovereign
Master, which is that <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by all his successors and borne by
the principal Socinian Rose-Croix documents, dating from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Faustus Socinius to that of Johann Wolff, which
are preserved in the Sovereign Patriarchal Council of
Hamburg. (That is the Supreme Jewish Lodge secretly
affiliated to International Masonry.)
In his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Themis Aurea, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in 1616 and 1617 and
printed in 1618, Maier, the Grand Master, refers to a
resolution passed at a meeting in 1617 in which it was
formally agreed that the Brotherhood of the Rose Croix must
maintain the strictest secrecy for a hundred years. On October
31 1617, the Convention of the Seven at Magdebourg had
indeed agreed to qualify its members during the ensuing one
hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

association which could carry on a more or less open
propaganda, while adopting such meas-sures of prudence as
might then be deemed expedient by the leaders of the sect.
Finally, the Seven adopted definitely, as being sufficiently
original to appeal to the popular imagination, Valentin
Andrea's curious story of the Rose Croix which had been
secretly print-ted in Venice towards 1613.
Robert Fludd was the author of Tractatus Apologe-ticus
(1617) and Clavis Philosophiae et Alchymiae (1633). He was
greatly helped in the foundation of the Rose Croix <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> in
England by Francis Bacon, author of Nova Atlantis 6 (1624).
Valentin Andrea to whom, as we have seen, are ascribed
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> Fama and Confessio, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Che-mycal

of Brunswick Wolfenbuttel, who was soon to make him his
chaplain.
To those who know the important part played by a Duke of
Brunswick during the French Revolution, this entrance of the
Brunswick family into the sect is very interesting. As a
Rosicrucian, Andrea was the teacher of Comenius (Amos
Kominsky), who frequently visited England during his
mysterious political career. Bishop of a Moravian community,
Comenius was the leader of the Moravian Brethren, a sect
pledged to achieve the extermination of the Catholic church
and which, being considered heretical, was also suspected of
practising secret satanism. The Moravians were imbued with
Socinianism, that is the doctrine of Lelius

Socinius which had been spread among them by his. nephew
Faustus Socinius who had found refuge in Moravia when
persecuted by the Church. Their link with Rosicrucianism had
already been established in the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of the pietist, Julius
Sperber, who was also one of their leaders. When Kominsky
was persecuted, he first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to London in 1641 and, early the

help by the powerful Swedish Minister, Count Axel
Oxenstiern, himself a Rosicrucian adept and protector of
another initiate, Ludwig van Geer from Holland.
The combination of the pursuit of alchemy and
her-meticism with political aims was frequently evidenced
even before the official appearance of Rosicrucianism. The
influence of adepts on the destinies of nations was immense.
To Queen Elizabeth, the advice of John Dee, her alchemist,
was always considered in matters affecting national policy,
and to Dee, his crystal gazer, Edward Kelly, was
indispensable as a medium. 7
Ludwig van Geer, (one of the Seven present at
Magdebourg) had settled in Sweden and had won over the
chancellor, Count Axel Oxenstiern, then the real regent, in
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the minority of Queen Christina. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> industrialist
of Dutch birth, with a colossal fortune made in the
manufacture of cannon, he had become a Baron, and as owner
of 20 ships of the Swedish fleet, he was an indispensable
man.
Another striking Rosicrucian figure was Thomas Vaughan,
(Eugenius Philaletes) not to be confused with his pupil,
George Starkey, known as Irenius Philaletes.
It is said that it was Thomas Vaughan who, inspired

by the writings of Nick Stone, conceived the idea of
subverting to the ambition of the sect to which he belonged,
the guild of the Freemasons which, owing to its universal
character, lent itself better than any other to the realization of
his project.
Nick Stone was one of the Seven of the Convention of
Magdebourg. As an architect, belonging to the guild of the
Freemasons, he had helped Inigo Jones, the grand-master of
the English Lodges which, at this period, were nonsectarian.
On the other hand, as a Rosicrucian he had grasped, in the
Luciferian sense, the idea given by Faustus Socinius, and he
had composed, for the nine grades of the fraternity, rituals
which the chiefs declared remarkable. His ritual of the eighth
degree (Magister Templi) was really Satanic.
Thomas Vaughan, struck by these manuscripts wondered
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be possible to extend the teaching of the
Rose Croix to all " accepted masons ", who were then
admitted to the lodges in an honorary capacity ; the
Freemasons received in their guild, under the name of "
accepted masons ", peers and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of letters or professional

of their meetings and patronized their entertainments. These
honorary members were their protectors and benefactors. 8
Vaughan believed that this element, gifted with certain
intellectual qualities, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lend itself better to the
propagation of the principles of occult Socinian-ism than the
workers of the Fellow Craft, and, having made up his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
that this was the solution of the problem, he hastened to put it
into practice.
8. This is still customary. Many of the English Guilds of
today such as the Goldsmiths have honorary members who,
for attending their dinners receive a box of chocolates and £3 in
cash.

Some brothers of the Rose Croix were already mingling
with the Freemasons. Among the members of the Warrington
Lodge were Richard Penkett, James Collier, Richard Sankey,
Henry Littler, John Ellam and Hugh Brewer and in London,
the Whartons and their friends had slipped into a lodge as "
accepted masons ".

CATHARES, ALBIGENSES, WALDENSES

Manicheism, with its hierarchy and missionary system, had
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> root in Europe and, with its chief seat in Bulgaria, had
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> found its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into Northern Italy and the southern part of
France.
Unquestionably Manicheans in their beliefs and teachings,
the Cathares (purifiers or pure) held the unadulterated
tradition of Manes. Their hierarchy was that established by
their founder. In the 12th century, their supreme chief was in
Bulgaria having under him, bishops, priests, deacons and
simple Perfects. These composed the class of Perfects who
were distinguished from the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> degree of Believers.
As to the Albigenses, their name derived from Albi, a town
of Languedoc, covered not one but many sects issued from
Manicheism and Arianism, and counted also many Jews or
judaised Christians. Under this appellation of Albigenses,
historians, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> political or religious, have almost
unanimously included the Cathares.

excesses of which popes, bishops and almost all dignitaries
of the Church were guilty. The

pioneers of the rebellion had been Peter of Bruys (died 1126)
and the monk Henri (died 1148).
They had openly attacked the vices of the clergy and fallen
victims, the first to his own fanaticism (he was killed by the
mob <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> anger he had aroused by pulling down a wooden

attacked the beliefs and practices of the Church ; like the
Baptists of today they rejected the practice of baptism for
children, and denied the dogmas of transubstantiation and
redemption through Christ.
They gained many adherents and <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> numerous disciples
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> Manichean opposition to the Church was identical

preaching of Peter Waldo who, although he repudiated the
dualist doctrine of the Manicheans, formed a serious
opposition to the Church. He <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the sect of the
Waldenses divided in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> degrees, Perfect and Believers. The
former made a vow of Poverty and as such <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the names of
Poor Brethren, the latter formed the Outer or <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Order.
From the South of France and Northern Italy, persecution
drove the Waldenses to the Central and Northern provinces of
France, thence to England, then from Lombardy into
Germany and Bohemia. John Wickliffe (1324-1384) in
England and John Huss (1369-1415) in Bohemia, were their
foremost representatives and in the latter country they formed
the Bohemian Brethren who later also <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the name of
Moravian Brethren or Religious Masons.

Margrave Albert expelled the Jews from the town of Iglau,
in Moravia, on the ground that they had been in league with
the Taborites, the subversive element among the Hussites.
The Taborites were Bohemians.
The Moravian Brothers or Unitas Fratrum, a Gnostic sect,
were founded in 1457 at Kunewald, near Seftenberg, by
Gregory ; the nephew of the Calixtine leader Rokyzana. They
were an offshoot of the Bohemian Brethren said to represent
the religious kernel of the Hussite movement.
At the Synod of Lhota near Reichenau, in 1467, they
constituted themselves into a Church separate from the
Calixtine or National church of Bohemia.
The constitution of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was revised at a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>

who may be regarded as their <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> founder. This
reorganization enabled the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> to grow rapidly. In the

Unitas included nearly 400 congregations in Bohemia and
Moravia, with 150,000 members, and, including Poland,
embraced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> provinces — Bohemia, Moravia, where the
Jews are the best educated of the inhabitants, and in a few
small towns <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> half of the population, and Poland.
Each province had its own bishops and synods, but all were
united in one church and governed by the general synod.
The Lutheran movement in Germany awakened lively
interest among the Brethren, and some unsuccessful attempts
were made under the leadership of Agusta to unite with the
Lutheran Church (1528-1546); but when the Calvinist
reformation reached Bohemia, the Brethren found themselves
more in sympathy with it than with the Lutheran. The Jesuit
anti-reformation, instigated by Rudolf and his brothers
Matthias and Ferdinand, found the Brethren a prosperous
church, but the pitiless persecution which followed the
unsuccessful attempt at revolution crushed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Protestantism of Bohemia, and in 1627 the Evangelical churches
there had ceased to exist. About the same time, the Polish
branch of the Unity, in which many refugees from Bohemia
and Moravia had found a home, was absorbed in the
Reformed Church of Poland. A few families, however,
especially in Moravia, held religious services in secret,
preserved the traditions of their fathers, and, in spite of the
vigilance of their enemies, maintained some correspondence
with each other. In 1722, some of these <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> home and property
to seek a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where they could worship in freedom. The first

soon joined by others (about 300 coming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> seven years),
and built a town which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Her-renhut. The small

Renewed Moravian Church. The new settlement was not,
however, destined to be simply a revival of the organization
of the Bohemian Brethren. Zinzendorf, who had given them
an asylum, came with his wife, family, and chaplain to live
among the refugees. He was a Lutheran who had accepted
Spener's pietism, and he wished to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> distinct

element and the adherents of the ancient Unitas Fratrum. The

THE ANABAPTISTS
(Founded 1521)

The Anabaptists were founded in 1521 by Nicolas Storch,
Mark Stubner and Thomas Muncer.
Their Heresies were founded on the following Lutheran
maxim interpreted subversively : A Christian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span>
of everything and is subject to no one. They further claimed
that infant baptism is null, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> adults only can be
baptized.
" If the Anabaptists ", writes Hoeninghaus, a German
Protestant writer, in La Reforme contre la Reforme, were not
all equally intolerant, they were nevertheless all equally
detested, hated, and persecuted by the Protestants much more
than by the Catholics. "
Queen Elizabeth ordered them to be excluded from
England.
Madden, in Phantasmata, describes their religion in the
following terms :
" We <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> among them claims to intercourse with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and
angels — to the gift of prophecy — to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of driving

dences of epidemic religious mania in countries which were
Protestant. " 1
At certain periods in its history, this sect wielded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

length of time, the entire senate was composed of
theomaniacs. As the republic was composed alone of fools
and madmen, it is incredible to what a length they carried
their excesses in Munster : each magistrate proposed for the
rule of government the wild chimeras of his own imagination,
disguised under the imposing name of revelation. It was a sad
spectacle to hear the deliberations of a senate composed
altogether of fanatics : some being inspired in a perfectly
contrary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to that suggested to others : nevertheless, each
one adhering to the dictates of his inspiration, because he
believed that a special revelation had been made to him.
When such things, says Calmeil, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in a country,
where pseudo-prophets are tolerated who disseminate terror,
and run about the streets <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any clothing, when the

places in the midst of their disciples and apostles, the will of
the Supreme Being is supposed to serve as a rule and direction
to all the extravagances that mortals fall into, and it is difficult
to say where will end the excesses of this religious delirium...
The Anabaptists, when they fell into the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of their
enemies, allowed their fingers, tongue, nose and ears, to be
cut off, nay, even suffered themselves to be drowned by
hundreds in torrents, rather than desist or depart for a moment
from the orders they imagined came from God. " 2

In 1525, Luther headed an alliance of the Princes and
governments to repress these excesses, and they were
defeated at the Battle of Frankenhausen in that year, their
leader Thomas Muncer being seized and beheaded.
In 1536, John of Leyden proclaimed himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of the

<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by " the ungodly " and put to death.
The principal leaders of the sect were John Mathias, John
Bockhold, <span class="t6 t11 t13 t14 t15 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">David</span> George, William Hacket, Kotte-rus,
Kuhlmann and Dabricius.
" The principal offshoots of the Anabaptist fanaticism in
Germany, Holland, and Switzerland, were the Adamites, the
Apostolics, the Taciturn, the Perfect, the Impeccable, the
Liberated Brethren, the Sabbatarians, the Clancularians, the
Manifestarians, the Bewailers, the Rejoicers, the Indifferent,
the Sanguinarians, the Antimariens. " 3

GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND
(Founded 1717)

John Valentin Andrea, the Rosicrucian, having elaborated
a plan to merge all the existing religious Societies into one
organization, published in 1614 a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Universal and
General Reformation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Whole</span> Wide World, in which he
advocated the foundation of a secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> of all classes,
pledged to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> quietly for the benefit of their fellows.
To this period also belongs the legend of Christian
Rosenkreutz (see page 151).
Andrea, however, failed in his endeavours but Jan Amos
Komensky (Comenius) joined actively in his efforts and, as
early as 1628, begged leave to share in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of which he
presently was given sole charge.
About this time, Comenius wrote his renowned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on
All-wisdom, the Pansophia, which embodied his ideas on the
foundation of humanity's Utopia.
This Moravian school-master, Comenius, while doubtless
an idealist, was also interested in spiritism, prophecies,
revolution, Antichrist, the Millenium and such like whims of
a dangerous fanaticism. He collected the visions of the
Anabaptists, Kotterus and those of Dab-ricius and published
them at Amsterdam. Those visions

promised such wonders as the extermination of the Pope, the

Sweden, Cromwell and others and were of a most disturbing
character. 1
When Anderson undertook the task of uniting the old
traditions of practical Masonry with the more recent
development and broadened ideas of the new world-league,
he incorporated in his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of constitution a reproduction of
the main part of the plans and ideas of Comenius. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

decisive passages were adopted almost literally.
The transformation of the Lodge was actually carried out
in 1663 when, in the General Assembly of Masons, the
masters of operative masonry, feeling themselves supplanted
and overruled, realized that if they did not wish to forsake
their Lodge they must unite with its new masters and
subordinate themselves to their designs — Henry Jermyn,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> St. Albans, was elected and installed Grand Master, Sir
John Denham became his deputy and Sir Christopher Wren
and John Webb, wardens.
The English Grand Lodge, as we know it, was founded on
June 24, 1717, by Anderson, Desaguliers (an expatriated
Frenchman said to have been the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the Rose Croix),
Calvert, James King, Elliot, Lumden Madden and George
Payne.2 It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees, Apprentice,

English masonry claims to be a purely charitable
institution.
It is Blue Masonry which answers to the lesser mysteries
of the ancients wherein, in reality, nothing but the exoteric
doctrines were revealed, whilst spurious masonry, or all
subsequent degrees (for no one can be initiated into them who
has not passed through the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees) answer to the
greater Mysteries. 3
" According to Anderson's own showing", stater,
Freemasonry Universal, " previous to the formation of Grand
Lodge in 1717 the ceremonies of the Freemasons were purely
Christian, but soon after that important change it was decided
to widen the basis of the Craft so that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of all religious

On page 303 of The Rosicrucian and Masonic Record can
be found the " Articles of Union ", dated 1813, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

" Very little is known of the proceedings of Masonic bodies,
from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that very few <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> documents were permitted
to be recorded, and of these few, owing to the jealousy or
over-caution of their rulers, many were burnt in London in
1721. "
We can accept the causes given above for the destruction
of these documents with a smile!
On initiation, Masons receive an alias by which name they
are henceforth known in the Lodge.
All Masonry is founded on the usual system of sectarian
help. " Help a Mason " supplants the Christian teaching of "
Help everyone ".

it does a virtual business boycott against non-masons. Each

Masonry, English and Continental, has been very useful to
persons with political ambitions and minor mental and moral
capacities.

Apart from the Rosicrucians already mentioned, we see the
foundation and growth of such societies as :
1. The Strict Observance of the Baron Hund and the notorious
Jew Leucht who had assumed the name of Johnson, and several
other aliases. It recruited its members in the Lodges and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> from
occultism into political intrigue, later even formulating a plan of
economic and financial rule.
2. The Martinists, which, founded by a Portuguese Mar-rano
Jew, Martinez Depasqualy, united political intrigues, fomented for
the overthrow of the monarchy, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with magical practices. It
numbered among its members the chief politicians who prepared
the French Revolution. These were Savalette de Lange, William

3. The Scottish Rite.
4. The Moravian Brothers.
5. The Alta Vendita.
6. The Egyptian Rites of Cagliostro (Mizraim).
The adepts of all these different rites knew but little beyond the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that they had shaken off the yoke of Christian principles which
were replaced by the cult of nature, and in almost all cases
licentiousness. They 'Were but mere puppets manipulated by

1. The destruction of Christianity and of all Monarchical
Governments ;
2. The destruction of nations as such in favour of universal
internationalism ;
3. The discouragement of patriotic and loyal effort branded as narrow minded prejudice, incompatible with the tenets
of goodwill to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and the cry of " Universal Brotherhood
";
4. The abolition of family ties and of marriage by means of
systematic corruption ;

<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Mendelssohn, himself the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the Haskalah,
(Jewish Illuminati) cooperated with the Bavarian Illu-minati
of Weishaupt and with the prominent members of the other
revolutionary secret societies aspiring to political power, but,
in 1784, the Elector of Bavaria made an abortive effort to
stamp out the conspiracy which, being international, was
necessarily impervious to local measures. The poison of
subversion was working in France where on January 21, 1793,
it culminated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> on the scaffold of Louis XVI, an
event that in masonic jargon is known as " The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> cannon shot ". The capture of Rome by Cadorna in 1870 was the
third.

regard to the introduction of this rite in America is made in a
report by Albert Pike :
" We can soon learn how it was that the Council degrees
came, about 1766, from France, and not from Prussia. In
1761, the Lodges and Councils of the superior degrees being
extended throughout Europe, Frederic II (Frederic the Great),
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Prussia, as Grand Commander of the, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of
Princes of the Royal Secret, or 32 degrees, was by general
consent acknowledged and recognized as Sovereign and
Supreme <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">Head</span> of the Scotch Rite. " 1
" On the 25th Oct. 1762, the Grand Masonic Constitutions
were finally ratified in Berlin and proclaimed for the
government of all Masonic bodies working in the Scotch Rite
over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hemispheres; and in the same year they were
transmitted to the Jew, Stephen Morin, who had been
appointed, at the request of Lacorne, in August, 1761,
Inspector General for the New <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> by the Grand
Consistory of Princes of the Royal Secret, convened at Paris,
under the presidency of Chaillon de Joinville, representative
of Frederic (the Great) and Substitute General of the Order. 2
It will be remembered that the 33rd degree was not then
created; and under Frederic the Great, there was no rank
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the 32nd degree nor anybody superior to a
Consistory. " 3

the Lodge of Perfection, at Albany (New-York), was directed
as early as 1770 to transmit reports to Berlin. 6 This indeed
becomes significant when considered with the circumstances

described in The History of Freemasonry and Concordant

On November 30, 1773, the Lodge of St. Andrew's (that
founded by Dacosta and of which Warren was a member) was
closed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the transaction of any business, in

was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the lodge-room to destroy the tea on the then
arriving ships.
" On April 8, 1776, the Grand Lodge was convened for the

In 1738, Pope Clement XII had excommunicated the
Freemasons.
We extract the following instructive points from Adriano

it talks and vomits flames.
Its conversational propensities were however not revealed
until Gallatin Mackey, who claimed to be the reincarnation of
Jacques de Molay, developed the proclivity for going into an
annual trance on the 11th of March. This trance lasted about
one hour, during which the skull conversed volubly about
itself and all sorts of other things."
Pursuing the subject further, Margiotta states that:
" The Mother Lodge of Boston had ceased functioning for

interest is awakened by the perusal of Thomas Frost's <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> on
Secret Societies, from which we extract the following :
" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> results of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance in the progress of the
European revolution proceeded from the events that occurred
at Naples in 1820-21. One was the reorganization of the
Carbonari, consequent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the publicity given to the system

which it had hitherto been enveloped was no longer deemed
necessary ; the other was the extension of the system beyond
the Alps. When the Neapolitan revolution had been effected,
the Carbonari emerged from their mystery, published their
constitution and statutes, and ceased to conceal their patents
and their cards of membership. In the Papal States, in
Lombardy, and in Piedmont, the veil of secrecy was
maintained for a little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> longer, partly through the
adoption by the Carbonari in those portions of the peninsula
of symbols and pass-words different from those of the
Neapolitan lodges, partly by the for200

mation of the various societies of the Adelphi, the Guelphs,
the Brother Protectors, and the Italian Fede-rati, which were
similar, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> not the same, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> all holding the same
principles, and having a common object. But after the
collapse of the Piedmontese revolution, so much doubt and
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> existed among the leaders as to the extent to which the
secrets of the system were known that they were all effaced,
and consigned to oblivion. The scattered directors of the
movement drew <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> the broken threads of the
conspiracy as soon as they were able, but with a new
nomenclature and a new symbolism. 1
" The dispersion of the Carbonaro leaders had, at the same
time, the effect of extending the system in France, where it
had been introduced towards the end of 1820 and creating
centres of revolutionary agitation in the foreign cities in
which they temporarily located themselves.
General Pepe proceeded to Barcelona when the
counter-revolution was imminent at Naples, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was
no longer safe there ; and to the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> several of the
Piedmontese revolutionists when their country was
Austrianized after the same lawless fashion.
Scalvini and Ugoni <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> refuge at Geneva ; others of the
proscribed proceeded to London. This dispersion, and the
progress which Carbonarism was making in France,
suggested to General Pepe the idea of an international secret
society, which should combine for a common purpose the
advanced political reformers of all the European States.

of which, he says,
' was to enable the members to correspond and by these
means preclude the possibility of a renewal of that want of
union which had been experienced amongst the most noted
patriots of Spain and Portugal, Naples and Piedmont. Several
deputies of the Cortes were inclined to regard such an
association as extremely beneficial to the public cause, more
especially in their own peninsula, where a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> want of
concord existed between the Portuguese and the Spaniards.
The <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was accordingly founded; several members of the

between the most enlightened patriots of the different cities in
Europe. It was decided that I should exert myself to give it
extension in Lisbon, London and Paris ; and that, in the event
of my success, other members should proceed to propagate it
over Italy and Germany. '
" Having organized in Madrid the first circle of the
Constitutional <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of European Patriots, Pepe proceeded
to Lisbon, where he was even more successful in his efforts
than in the Spanish capital. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> of the Ministers, and several
Councillors of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> and members of the Cortes signified their
adhesion, and, before Pepe left, a flourishing circle was
formed, under the direction of Almeida-Moraes, the president
of the Cortes. From Lisbon the general proceeded by sea to
London, where, as he says, he soon found that 'a secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span>
in England among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> quite out of the

met with no encouragement. The Duke of Sussex and Sir
Robert "Wilson read the statutes and regulations of the
society, but only as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of curiosity. "

This curiosity is doubtless responsible for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of
what was later known as The International Committee of

date, to subvert English Freemasonry to the aims of The
International. According to the system which worked out
later, English Freemasonry retained, to all appearances, its
original autonomy.
But to proceed with the statement of Frost :
" Pepe next opened a correspondence with Lafayette, who
hailed the proposed international organization of the secret
societies as ' a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Alliance opposed to that of despotism, '
and at once associated himself with it. He, with Manuel and

The Author of Secret Societies of the European Revolution
writes the foregoing paragraph but fails to explain it.
Who and what are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> he refers to ?
Such indeed are the political principles adopted by the
leaders of Freemasonry. Therein lies its power. As soon as
any political movement becomes inevitable, as soon as public
pressure on an existing government becomes too strong, this
sect, in the name of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, takes the
secret leadership of the opposing faction. Through the new
government which becomes the subservient tool of its
capricious master, who, at any moment, may suppress its
fledgling, by creating and backing a new opposition, it holds,
not the balance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> but all the power.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> : Those who rule Freemasonry today, rule the world.
And Frost further adds :
"In 1831, the French Government had not only proclaimed
a policy of non-intervention, but had expressly declared that
France <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not permit intervention on the part of any other

deceived by these professions, and assured Misley (the agent
of the Masonic Revolutionary Committee) that the Italians
had nothing to fear. "

GENERAL PEPE AND THE " ONE BIG UNION "

205

In that year Masonry made an attempt to cast off the
Austrian yoke in Italy by using France as its base of
operations. Owing however to French non-cooperation the
revolution failed.
" A few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> afterwards, Misley and Linati arrived at
Marseilles and chartered a vessel, aboard which they put a
couple of cannon and twelve hundred muskets. They were
joined by General Pepe, Count Grilenzoni, the advocate
Mantovani, Dr. Franceschini, and Lieutenant Mori; but, at the
last moment, the Prefect received a telegraphic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> from
Paris to prevent their embarkation and lay an embargo on the
vessel. General Pepe evaded the vigilance of the police,
however, and contrived to reach Hyeres, where he <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of
the entrance of the Austrians into Bologna, and thereupon
abandoned his intention of giving the aid of his reputation and
experience to the revolutionary cause. "
In connexion with the agitation provoked in Piedmont,
during the reign of Charles Albert, by Mazzini's " Young
Italy " movement in 1848, the veteran General Pepe again
comes into prominence. On March 29, 1848, he arrived at
Naples, and was sent for by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Ferdinand who invited him

with the Ministries of War and Marine. " Every difficulty
however was thrown in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of Pepe's projected military
operations, " the Naval Department insisting that the fleet
could not convey troops, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> interposing various delays

the organization of a supreme rite, introduced into
Freemasonry, to lend a satanic character to the vague divinity

Architect of the Universe ".
During the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> preceding the capture of Rome,
Mazzini had established relations with the Masonic chief of
Scottish Rites, Albert Pike, President of the Supreme Council
of Charleston, United States.
Pike was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> student of the Cabala and the occult.
Mazzini had understood that Freemasonry was a powerful
lever with which to revolutionize the world, but he saw it
divided into numerous rites, often rivals, and even hostile to
one another. Aspiring to Italian Unity as a means of breaking
the temporal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> See, he dreamt of a union of
masonry throughout the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to destroy the church itself as a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> power.
He addressed himself to Pike in preference to another
Grand Orient or Supreme Council chief because of the many
international ramifications of Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rites, as Pike, its recognised chief, had succeeded in gaining
considerable influence over all the Supreme National
Councils of this rite which had hitherto been of a purely
dogmatic and liturgic character.
Mazzini, who was very practical, said that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
inadvisable to favour one rite only to the exclusion of all the
others. In a letter to Albert Pike, dated Jan. 22, 1870, he writes.
" We must allow all the federations to continue just as they
are, with their systems, their central authorities and their
divers modes of correspondence between <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> grades of the
same rite, organized as they are at present, but we must create
a supreme rite, which will remain unknown, to which

we will <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> those Masons of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> degree whom we shall
select. With regard to their brothers in masonry, these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
must be pledged to the strictest secrecy. Through this
supreme rite, we will govern all Freemasonry which will
become the one international centre, the more powerful
because its direction will be unknown. "
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Mazzini formed the scheme of
unifying Freemasonry by creating one central universal
direction reserved to a small <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> masons chosen
with the greatest care, he selected Albert Pike as an ally.
Pike was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in Boston on Dec. 29, 1809.
His parents, in modest circumstances, succeeded in giving
him a course at Harvard College. He then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to join his
family at Newbury port. There, for a while, he taught in a
primary school till he moved to Fair-haven where he
continued his career of pedagogue.
In 1833 he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Little Rock.
From 1830 to 1840, Masonry in the United States had
fallen into disrepute and almost ceased to exist. After the
torture and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of William Morgan in 1826, many lodges
faded into oblivion to resuscitate only after the storm of
public censure had abated.
During the Civil War, Pike served as brigadier-general in
the Confederate army. The Confederate government named
him Indian Commissioner and charged him with the conduct
of negotiations with the most powerful savage tribes, to raise
an army of their warriors. To facilitate his organization of this
army he was made Governor of Indian Territory, and once
these hordes were united, they were placed under his command. What followed can be easily understood as his troops
were composed of Chickasaws, Comanches,
Creeks, Cherokees, Miamis, Osages, Kansas and
Choc-aws, with all of whom he personally was on the best

of terms. Among them, he was known as " the faithful
pale-face friend and protector ". It was no longer war — it
was an orgy of murder and atrocities so terrible that the
foreign powers interfered. Representations made by England,
threatening intervention in the name of humanity, finally
compelled Jefferson Davis to disband his auxiliary Indian
troops.
Mrs. Liliana Pike Room gives us the following chronological history of her father's early Masonic career. She says
that he became an Oddfellow, some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the forties, and in
1850 entered the Masonic Fraternity. After that he gradually
ceased to be active as an Oddfellow. Soon becoming
prominent in Masonry he advanced rapidly to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
honours. His Masonic record is as follows :
" He was initiated in Western Star Lodge at Little Rock,
Arkansas, in 1850.
" Raised to the degree of Worshipful Master, in Western
Star Lodge No. 1, Little Rock, Arkansas, in July 1850.

which was now destined to be filled by the particular member
of the Fraternity selected by the conspirators. Among these

Supreme Council of Charleston to which he was duly elected

" Once Grand Master, Pike reestablished the supremacy of

an important Masonic personage and the real chief of Scottish
Rites ".

established at Rome under Mazzini himself who, knowing the

seldom appeared at the official meetings of the Grand Orient

Rut was this interest, plan or pretence ?
In the following paragraph on the International in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span>
Revolution by N. Webster, page 179, we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a link, if not the
link, between Mazzini and Karl Marx. Mazzini and his
International Masons are already preparing the subversion of
the Socialist Labour movement.
" At the meeting in St. Martin's Hall, on September 28,
1864, when the ' International' was definitely founded, Marx
played no part at all. ' I was present', he wrote Engels, ' only as
a dumb personage on the platform'. Rut he was named
nevertheless a member of the sub-committee, the other
members being Mazzini's secretary— a Polish Jew named
Wolff — Le Lubez, a French Freemason, Cremer, the
secretary of the English Masons' Union, and Weston, the
Owenite. At the first meeting of this committee, Wolff placed
before it the statutes of Mazzini's Working-men's Association,
proposing them as the basis of the new association; Le Lubez
suggested amendments described by Marx as ' perfectly
childish '. ' I was firmly resolved ', he wrote, 'not to leave a
single line if possible of all their balderdash'. In a few weeks
he had succeeded in establishing his authority. ' My
propositions were all accepted by the commission.' "

agents manoeuvred Marx into this position to suit their own
ends, is <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to our imagination, but the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of someone, not
an outstanding personality, being elected or nominated on a
committee for no particular reason, generally means, to
anyone versed in the technique of political tricks, that the
nomination or election was something arranged " behind the
scenes ".
On page 46 in La Theologie Politique de Mazzini et
I'lnternationale, Bakounine, the celebrated Russian anarchist,
refutes certain statements said to have been current in London
about himself at the time, in the following terms :
"But in 1864, while on my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through London, he (Karl
Marx) came to see me, and assured me that he (Mazzini) had
never <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> any part direct or indirect in these calumnies
against me which he himself had considered most infamous. I
had to believe. "
It is a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that for a certain length of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Mazzini and
Marx were closely associated.
An eminent Mason, the atheist leader of the Italian
Socialists, Alberto Mario, husband of Miss Jessie White, an
ardent Mazzinian and the authoress of a history of her hero —
Delia vita di Giuseppe Mazzini — was moreover a tool of
Pike whom he generally consulted on all important matters.
Thus, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to divert the attention of the imperfect initiates,
Mazzini organized a congress of working <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in Rome, in
October 1871. A close examination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of this
congress shows however that it was only pretence for nothing
practical was attempted or accomplished. On the other hand,
he busied himself with grouping all the political elements of
the sect in which occult manoeuvre his agent, Adriano
Lemmi, helped him more than anyone else.

Mazzini was <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of an enthusiastic praise for his col-

del Popolo. The public however failed to understand the
sentiment that inspired him to proclaim the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a
divinity and denounce materialism and atheism. One was
puzzled to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> a mystic. He showed himself
extremely religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he declared himself the sworn enemy
of the Church ! " 5
Pike's literary achievements were numerous. These were,
Ariel, Morals and Dogma, The Sacred Hymns, The Sephar H.
Debarim, <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of the Word6, Legenda Magistralia, Ritual of
the New and Reformed Palladium (4 grades out of 5) The
Booh of Revelations, The Supreme Verb, The Ritual of Elect
Magus, and The Booh of Apadno, which latter contains the
prophecies concerning the reign of the Anti-Christ from the
Satanic point of view.
The theological dogma of Albert Pike is explained in the '
Instructions ' issued by him, on July 14, 1889, to the 23
Supreme Councils of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and have been recorded by A.

When Mazzini felt himself to be dying, he designated
Adriano Lemmi as his successor. He died on March 11 1872,
at Pisa, and Albert Pike, deferring to his wishes, named
Adriano Lemmi as his successor.
Pike was not only an organizer and a politician, he was
also, in his religious capacity, as Cabalist and spiritist, a
mystic on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> personality the following anecdote sheds a

Sister Ingersoll, lifted into space, floated over the assembly
and her garments were suddenly devoured by a flame which
enfolded, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> burning her.

had the latest news of our very illustrious brother Adriano
Lemmi. Then, Astaroth, in person, revealed himself, flying
beside our medium and holding her hand. He breathed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

again. Finally Astaroth vanished and our sister fell gently on
to a chair where, with her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> thrown back she gave up Ariel
and the 329 spirits who had accompanied him.

A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of books of this period refer to what must have
been a wireless telephone in the possession of the heads of the
Masonic organization. A translation of the detailed
description of this instrument, given in Ba-taille's book, is
quoted herewith as being of interest in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> when magic
sometimes becomes experimental science. At the date on
which this description was first printed (1894) wireless was
unknown.
" In his house, Gallatin Mackey once showed me that
Arcula Mystica (the Mystic Box), of which there are only
seven examples in existence, at Charleston, Borne, Berlin,
Washington, Monte Video, Naples and Calcutta. 8
" The exterior of this small box resembles a liqueurs
receptacle. A spring catch opens simultaneously its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> doors
and lid. Inside, in the middle, stands a telephone mouthpiece
in silver, which, at first sight, one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> for a very small
trumpet or hunting horn. At the <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> is a little rope made of
twisted silver threads, one end of which is attached to the
machine while the other extremity ends in a, kind of little bell
which one holds to one's ear to hear the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
with whom one is speaking, just like the telephone of today.
At the right is a toad, -in silver, with its mouth open. Placed
around the opening of the mouth-piece, stand seven statuettes
in gold, each on a small separate silver pedestal representing
symbolically the seven cardinal virtues of the Palladian
Ladder.
" Each of these seven statuettes designates one of the
Directories. The statuette Ignis (sacred fire) <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> endeavour,

Labor (Labour) the Sovereign Administrative Directory of

Emancipatio (the emancipation of humanity shedding the
yoke of all despotisms) and Felicitas (Happiness derived
from virtuous practices) representing the four Grand Central
Directories of Washington, Naples, Monte Video and
Calcutta.
" 'When the Supreme Dogmatical chief wishes to
communicate, for example, with the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of political action,
he presses his finger on the Statuette Ignis and on the
Statuette Ratio : these sink into their sockets and at the same
instant, a strong whistling is <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in Rome, in the office
where Lemmi keeps his Arcula Mystica ; Lemmi opens his
box and sees the statuette of Ignis sunk, while tiny, harmless
flames issue from the throat of the silver toad. Then he knows
that the Sovereign Pontiff of Charleston wishes to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to
him. He presses down the statuette of Ratio in his box and
from then on, the conversation between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chiefs

described above, while at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> holding to his ear the
small silver bell.
" At the end of the conversation, each chief replaces the
golden statuettes by pulling them up by the head.
" Every Sovereign Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of a Directory travels
with his Arcula Mystica. This box is personally confided to
him. That of the Administrative Directory of Berlin is kept by
the Sovereign Finance Delegate... who is

Bleichroeder (1893).

word, and the force is literally thrown into the initiate's
bodies and centres, passing down through the centres
on the mental plane, via the astral centres, to the centres
on etheric levels, which finally absorb it. This is the stu
pendous moment for the initiate, and brings to him a
realisation of the literal absolute <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of the phrase

gainsaying that fiery energy and electric force constitute
the sum-total of all that is. He is literally bathed in the

4. As to the seven rays :
Groups of Egos are formed :
1. According to their ray.
2. According to their sub-ray.
3. According to their rate of vibration.
They are also grouped for purposes of classification :
1. As Egos, according to the egoic ray.
2. As personalities, according to the subray which is
governing the personality. 13
" All are graded and charted. The Masters have Their Halls
of Records, with a system of tabulation incomprehensible to
us owing to its magnitude and its necessary intricacies
wherein these charts are kept. They are under the care of a
Chohan of a Ray, each Ray having its own collection of
charts... These Halls of Records are mostly on the lowest
levels of the mental plane and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of the astral, as they
can be there most fully utilised and are most easily accessible.

" While the ray business may be an excellent scientific,

between Masons and anti-Masons. Societies of anti-Masons
have been formed, newspapers and magazines started, and
many pamphlets and volumes, with much correspondence,
published ; so that before the slavery question was passed
amongst them, all parties had merged themselves into
Masons and anti-Masons. Several persons were punished for
the abduction of Morgan : but the murderers were sheltered
by Masonic Lodges, and rescued from justice. "

tion in the Order, conceived the idea of publishing a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>
disclosing all the secrets of the sect. What his motive may
have been is only conjectural. Mr. Weed was living at that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the town of Rochester, New York, and Morgan
requested him to publish the projected book. Mr. Weed
declined, and Morgan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the adjoining town of Batavia,
where he arranged with another <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> for the publication.
" He had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> a portion of the book, and was engaged in
completing it when he was arrested on a false charge of
larceny, on the 10th Sept., and conveyed to the jail of Ontario
county. The sheriff and officers of this prison were Masons.
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> was searched, and his manuscripts were seized and
destroyed.
"On the evening of the 12th Sept, he was discharged by the
interference of some of the conspirators, and, as he passed out
of the door of the jail, was seized by them, <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> a short
distance, and then forcibly put into a carriage. He was carried,
in the course of that night, on to the ridge-road about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
miles beyond the village of Rochester. During the next day,
he was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to Lewiston, a distance of seventy or eighty
miles, and from thence to Fort Niagara, at the mouth of the
Niagara river. His benevolent captors had decided on
bringing him here in the hope that their brother Masons of
Canada <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> aid them in disposing of him. His murder was
not then contemplated ; but it was hoped that the Canadian
Masons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> charge of him and send him to end his

Placing their prisoner in Fort Niagara, his captors crossed the
river into Canada to attend a meeting of a lodge there ; but the
Canadian Masons, after much deliberation, refused to
become parties to the business. The American Masons
returned to Fort Niagara, and in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span>

assembled a short distance off to open an Encampment of

dined together, and, after dinner, the chaplain gave a

others to accompany him. These were Whitney, a
stonemason ; Chubbuch, a farmer; Garside, a butcher; and
Howard, a bookbinder. ' They were all' says Mr. Weed, ' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

driven in a carriage to the fort where Morgan was confined. It
was just midnight. They told the doomed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that his friends
had completed their arrangements for his removal to Canada,

He consented to go with them,
and they walked to the wharf where a boat was waiting for
them ; they embarked and rowed away into the darkness.
When the boat reached the point where Niagara River
empties itself into Lake Ontario, the murderers threw off all
pretence, and with some horrible mummeries ordered Morgan to prepare for death. They wound a rope around him,
attaching to each end of it a heavy weight, and threw him
overboard. He sank like a stone, and the murderers returned
to tell their comrades that the traitor had met a traitor's doom.
One of the murderers, Whitney, told all these particulars to

Nowadays, greater precautions are observed in getting rid
of the enemies of the sect. Some little study and the
cooperation of a few culpable doctors, its auxiliaries and
affiliates, enable the terrible sect to dispose easily of their
enemies. The victim of their vengeance, swallowing some
disease germ, meets a fate that none can prove to have been
artificially contrived. This is the secret of secrets, denied
again and again ! And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the charge remains ! For plague,

It is necessary here to say that in many instances, where a
masculine lodge has a feminine annex, its <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is
frequently completely ignored by the majority of the brothers.
No mutual visiting is allowed among the female members of
the lower masonic degrees, for a sister may enter lodges other
than her own, only after she has herself attained the fifth
degree. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>

his address before his Council in 1878, Albert Pike said :

We have no records of the transactions at Charleston from 1801

As regards the position of women in Masonry, we think
that this cannot be better explained than in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of

Universal Freemasonry, addressed to the 23 Supreme

" To the science of Faust, the real Mason will join the

pleasure only when he wishes it and will wish it only when he
should do so.
" We earnestly recommend the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of Lodges of
Adoption. They are indispensable to the formation of Masons
who are indeed Masters of themselves. The pnest tries to
subdue his <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> by enforced celibacy... The real Mason, on
the contrary, reaches perfection, that is to say achieves self
mastery, by using his zeal

Dr. Bataille elucidates this point in the following terms :
" Concerning androgynous lodges, Masons generally give
the same answer. They either say 'Yes, once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there

hide the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the sister masons, it is now opportune to
expose the ruse employed in stifling further investigation.
From <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time, one of the semi-initiates is urged to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> a
resolution suggesting the establishment of feminine lodges,
and a petition is drawn up and sent in to the Grand Orient or
Supreme Council, whereupon the chiefs gravely insert a
decree in the official bulletin rejecting the petition, and
emphasising the point that ' the constitution is opposed to the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of regular female lodges '. Then, whenever the
question of sister masons is raised in the profane press, —
quick! The Grand Orients and Supreme Councils publish
these famous decrees. " 16
In certain cities where masonic secrecy is less carefully
guarded, a part of the masonic premises is available for the
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the profane public and daily lectures or instructions of

" The ' Pink Serpents ' are sister masons. They are the luciferian
missionaries and operate as individuals and under conditions of the
greatest secrecy. No records of the money appropriated for these
religious spies are shown. "
But let us resume the subject of Palladism as explained by Dr.
Bataille.
" This super-rite, which is masonic luciferian spiritism, must not
be confused with the machinery of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> masonry. Palladism is the
cult of Satan in the inner shrines of a rite superposed to ail the rites.
It is a cult, a religion. <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> masonry is a supreme administration
involving an organization much more highly developed than
Palladism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> secret leaders, some of whom are not luciferian,
act in concert and accept a superior central authority in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that

These officers are obliged to live in Germany and to be in a
sufficiently independent position to be able to go to the seat of
the Directory at a moment's notice.
" The business of the Propaganda agent is to furnish
information to the chiefs at Rome and Charleston... He
receives monthly, by secret messenger from Berlin, the report
of all measures formulated at the Sovereign Administrative
Directory relating to means and methods judged useful in

" As above said, the Palladian rite has no share in the
functioning of the Sovereign Administrative Directory. This
should again prove that Palladism is superposed to all the
other rites. It is the luciferian religion and only need concern
itself with the triangles which have a separate budget. Being
the real hidden power, known only to the perfect initiates, it
need not unveil itself even to this permanent committee which

forces. Then, only the puppets change while the rule of the
individuals controlling the machine continues unhindered.
Voters who wonder why their efforts have failed, wonder in
vain. As the dupes of a controlled publicity their privilege of
the vote is a farce.
If all factions in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> can be controlled from one source,
why should International Control be impracticable? Italy, if
one follows its history for the last hundred years, gives a

and Bismarck.
International control was Mazzini's dream. His cynical
remark " We aspire to corrupt in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to rule " leaves one
little <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in the idealism of this Patriarch of International
Freemasonry. That he applied his motto is shown by the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
he made of Francesco Crispi.
As Palamenghi-Crispi writes : 1
" Crispi became personally acquainted with Mazzini in
London, in January, 1855, but they had corresponded since
1850, when, their golden dream of liberty and independence
banished by the return of all the tyranny of the past, the
bravest of the patriots had once more begun to conspire.
" While pondering the idea of founding a National
Committee in which the various regions of Italy should be
represented, Mazzini also determined to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a fund for the
carrying out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> enterprises. And ' as it is impossible to

a National Loan, to be raised by the issue of bonds to be
redeemed by a liberated Italy.
" The first act of the National Committee was to authorise
the issue of such bonds to the amount of ten million lire. "
In his youth, Francesco Crispi made a mistake, and
blackmail made him a ruler of men. As the tool of Mazzini,
he ruled Italy for many years, and as the ruler of Italy, he
wielded the secret <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of International Masonry in
accordance with the policy of his masters.
According to Crispi 33° by D. Vaughan, " Crispi, in
Palladism, Brother v Serafino-Chiocciola, was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at Ribera,
in Sicily, on Oct. 4, 1819. His father, Tommaso Crispi, a
lawyer, destined him to the church, but in 1837, he married
Felicita Valle, a pretty young girl with whom he was
infatuated. In 1856, he abandoned her for Rosalia
Montmasson, deserting the latter in 1878 to marry Lina
Barbagallo, widow Capellani. At this period, he was openly
accused of bigamy and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> challenged to do so, he never
produced the documents necessary to prove the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his
first wife, Felicita Valle.
" After his marriage in 1837, he practised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> and in 1838
joined one of the numerous secret societies which in those

political intriguer and conspirator travelling over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> on
his sinister business under different aliases and false
passports provided for him by Mazzini, who, in <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of his
confidential position as friend of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Naples, had
bought his services as a spy. "
Domenico Margiotta states in Francesco Crispi, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span>

which penalty he however successfully escaped — a
telegram from Mazzini, instructing the organization to " give
Crispi promptly thirty <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> ducats to begin with on the
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Neapolitan Committee of Young Italy and let
him get to work. "
"While at Malta in 1855, he joined the masonic lodge, "
Zetland", under English jurisdiction from which he was
shortly expelled for the theft of 800 francs from one of its
members. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to London shortly afterwards. There, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
Palmerston had returned to power. By becoming an ardent
admirer and fanatical follower of Mazzini, Crispi
simultaneously entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> graces of Palmerston who
was on the very best of terms with the Italian leader.
In 1856, believing that Napoleon III, in cooperation with
Cavour, was the secret arbiter of the destinies of Italy, and the
greatest obstacle to the realization of his own republican
schemes, Mazzini induced Crispi to go to Paris.
While he was there, a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of attempts were made on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Emperor, among others that of Orsini on Jan. 14,
1858, but, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> strongly suspected of participation in these
conspiracies by the police or Paris, no evidence for a direct
charge of complicity against Crispi was ever obtained.
However, it is known that he and Orsini had previously met in
London where the latter had shown him how to make the
famous bombs, the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> and manufacture of which Crispi
afterwards taught his followers in Sicily.
By August 3, 1858, he was back in London, the Paris
police having developed too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a zeal on his behalf during
his sojourn in the French capital.
At last by 1860, the various Italian conspiracies
crystallized into one. Everything was ready for the fulfilment

Bixio and Crispi decided to go to Turin themselves to see
General Garibaldi and, after the British Minister, Sir James
Hudson, had confirmed certain information on conditions in
Palermo, which had been furnished by the Genoese deputies,
the General seemed at last inclined to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> action. He ordered
Bixio to Genoa to charter a ship and Crispi to Milan to
receive from Enrico Besana the arms and the money already
subscribed. This subscription was begun by General
Garibaldi himself and, in <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of later developments, it is a
significant <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that one of the contributions he received for
the famous expedition of the One Thousand, was the sum of
fifty <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> francs from the Jew, Cornelius Herz.
Twelve <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> guns were in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of Massimo
d'Azeglio, then governor of Milan who, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the
government, surrendered them to the rebels.
Finally, General Garibaldi arrived in Genoa on April 14.
On the 16th, Crispi returned to Turin where he saw the
Minister of the Interior, Farini, who, having by that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
changed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> concerning the Italian expedition, had
ceased to be a dictator and had assumed the attitude of a
diplomatic satellite of Cavour. He proved quite intractable.
Back in Genoa, Crispi found La Farina again, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with
orders to report all developments to Cavour. Cavour, warned
not to interfere with Garibaldi, raised no obstacles to the
progress of the plot. He only advised waiting for better news
from the Island of Sicily, and promised to cooperate with a
million guns, as soon as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for the expedition seemed
propitious.
Still Garibaldi hesitated. The Sicilian news was contradictory. On April 26, Crispi received from Niccola
Fabrizzi a message from Malta reading " Failure in the
provinces and in the town of Palermo. Many exiles

arriving at Malta on English ships. " Luckily a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> later,
a communication from Palermo, published by the Gazette of
Turin, told of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> proportions assumed by the
insurrection in Sicily, This communication had been invented
and <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> at Genoa by Crispi for the purposes of
overcoming the last scruples of Garibaldi !
One day, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> of May, Crispi and Garibaldi were
alone in a room looking seaward, in the Villa Spinola Quarti.
They were talking about the expedition. Crispi as usual, was
fighting the vacillations of Garibaldi. Suddenly, the General
interrupted him saying, " You are the only one to encourage
me in this enterprise, Everyone else tries to dissuade me.
Why ?"
"Because I am profoundly convinced that it will be helpful
to the fatherland and that it will cover you with glory. I <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span>
only one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> : The uncertainty of the sea. "
" I answer for the sea " said Garibaldi.
" And I answer for the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> " said Crispi.
Garibaldi was persuaded and the die was cast.
After the victorious expedition of the One <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Thousand</span> had
placed the group of conspirators in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in Sicily, each was
rewarded according to his merits, Crispi becoming Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Cavour had died on June 6, 1861,
poisoned, it is said, on May 28, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of Mazzini.
Until 1861, Crispi had cooperated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> heart-1 edly with
the revolutionaries but, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> wore on, he began to think
that it might be more to his personal advantage to serve the

His plan was discovered by Mazzini's spies and in 1862,
the deputy of Castelvetrano found himself facing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> for

Early in April 1862, he attended a Freemasonic dinner of
the Associations Emancipatrice at Turin. Suddenly he felt ill,
very ill, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> seemed to be burning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> him. He was in the
throes of the most appalling agony. Instead of <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span>
assistance, the other guests began to laugh, then, one of them
rising, spoke to him severely in the following terms :
" Francesco, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to visit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Victor Emmanuel,

secret services. You let him know that you were ready to go
over at the first opportunity. Till then your opinions had been
republican. Well, that is treason. We have condemned you.
You are poisoned. You are a dead man. "
The poison had indeed been administered in the bread.
Among the organizers of the banquet was the baker Dolfi,
who had formerly contributed to the expulsion of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany and who had become one of the members of
the Radical Directing Committee. On this occasion, Dolfi had
kneaded the bread himself, and each guest had found his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at the table marked by a small roll bearing his name,
traced on its golden crust by a fillet of whitish dough. All the
guests, agreeably surprised, had congratulated the baker for
his delicate attention, but the piece of bread marked Crispi
had been separately kneaded and contained the poison.
Crispi realized <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> that he was lost. He knew there
was no escape and that all the exits to the banquet hall were
closed, moreover, he was too weak to tight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span>

was raised and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> appeared. He advanced slowly. It was
Mazzini.
" Poor wretch ! " said he to the dying man. " I pity you. "
At these words, Crispi looked up. His dim <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> gleamed
suddenly and he murmured feebly.
" Yes, ambition made me betray... It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> ... I was going
to sell myself... But I die... Do not insult my agony... Do not
mock me... 1 suffer too much ! "
" I do not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to you in derision, " answered the grand
master, " Francesco Crispi, I forgive you... Drink this and you
are saved. You will be reborn... "
So saying, he forced his teeth apart and pressing a small
vial to the lips of the dying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> poured the counter-poison
down his parched throat.
After his last words, Crispi had collapsed. Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
passed. Was he still alive ? He seemed a corpse. Little by
little, sweat gathered on his face and <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> then, slowly, his
livid countenance regained some colour.
For a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he seemed inert. Then his eyelids opened
and, looking around with a stunned expression of
incomprehension, he asked.
" Where am I ? "
" You have returned from the realm of the dead "
murmured Mazzini gravely.
" Oh ! Yes, I remember now, Mercy ! Mercy ! " he added
suddenly, recalling realities and clinging desperately to life. "
I live indeed, Master. Is it not a dream ? "
"You live, yes, Francesco; but henceforth you are more
completely enslaved than the last of the negroes for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

instrument for us and we have condemned it to disappear
after it has served our purpose. "
This plan of action was carried out. In 1864, Crispi, on
orders from his master, became a Royalist and duly
denounced Mazzini. That is the explanation of his often
incoherent and erratic policies in after life. Maz-1 zini's
promise was fulfilled and Crispi became Minister of the
Interior in 1878.
In 1877, he had been on a tour to Paris, Berlin, London and
Vienna. In Paris, he had seen Thiers, Jules Favre and
Gambetta; in Germany, Prince Bismarck, with whom he
already had an acquaintance of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> standing, and who
shared his aversion for France and the Roman Catholic
Church ; in England, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Derby and Mr. Gladstone ; but the

a consequence of his interview with Bismarck, at Salzbourg,
Italy, fearing

France, threw herself into the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the Iron Chancellor.
Germany henceforth was to hold her as a dog ready to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
at either against Austria or France when it suited her purpose.
The Triple Alliance was formed on May 20, 1882.
Crispi's accession to the ministry was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> a victory of
prime importance to the sect.

Francesco Crispi, who, with the Jew Baro-zilai, became his

succeeded by Humbert I. That same year saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of
Pope Pius IX and the accession to the papacy of Leo XIII.
In 1884, Humbert I was initiated into masonry as Knight
Kadosch, under conditions of the greatest secrecy and a lodge,
that of Savoia Illuminata, was founded in his honour.
In spite of his exalted masonic position the monarch's
political information was always strictly censored by his
masonic superiors.
From 1887 to 1891, and again from 1893 to 1896, Crispi
acted the part of Prime Minister.
In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to enable him to curry favour with the common
people, Lemmi occasionally authorized him to execute
political turnovers. The Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Lemmi once said to
Humbert " <span class="t28 hoverable">Fear</span> not; The socialism of Crispi will not last; it
will provoke no riots, it is simply an electoral manoeuvre "
and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> was much gratified at being so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> informed.
There at least, the 33° <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> was not deceived. If now and
again Crispi resumed his revolutionary complexion, it was
only to obtain the votes of those whom he persecuted
mercilessly once he had obtained power. To him, a

change of opinion was as easy as a change of shirt. 2
In 1889, came the scandal of the Banca Romana, revealed
as such through the efforts of Giovanni Gio-' litti 3 and in 1892,
that of Panama involving another, namely the Grand Cordon
of Cornelius Herz, any one of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have swamped
the political career of any unprotected individual. Crispi,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> seriously implicated, was supported through an
impossible situation by the masonic brotherhood.
The Abyssinian War, itself the result of masonic intrigue,
was the terrible manoeuvre calculated to ruin the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of
Savoy in the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of the Italian people.
It was known that, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the disaster of Adowa, the
succession of Adriano Lemmi to the Grand Mastership of the
Grand Orient of Italy was open, and that competition for the
position was keen. Some favoured the candidacy of Bovio,
others that of Nathan, later Mayor of Rome. But Crispi had
promised General Baratieri, 4 a masonic dignitary, that he
should have the preference above all others, on condition that
he win a victory over the Negus. Such an achievement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
give Italy another Garibaldi, a popular hero, while
simultaneously providing Crispi himself with a useful tool
and the position of " top dog " which had never been his
before.
But the disastrous defeat of his candidate by Mene-1 lek, at
the Battle of Adowa on March 2, 1896, resulted in the fall of
Crispi, not that of the king.
The agent of Lemmi had played his part but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> game

The fate of Italy is the fate of all nations governed by
political rings. Italy in the 19th century seems to have been
the vortex of the intrigue directed against Christianity which
today ravages the world, carrying in its wake a general
disregard of all ideals, decency, duty and loyalty.
Liberty is corrupted into licentiousness, marital fidelity
into perversion, equality into equality of low standards and

information necessary to the reader, from :
Adriano Lemmi
by Domenico Margiotta 33°
Adriano Lemmi was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> of Roman Catholic parents, at
Leghorn, Tuscany, on April 30, 1822. He was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of
Fortunato Lemmi and Teresa Merlino, his lawful wife.
At an early age, he became the despair of his parents. He
was dissolute, frequented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> haunts and formed undesirable
friendships.
Running away from home on December 29, 1843, he
forged a letter stating, under the letterhead of Falconet and
Co., that a credit for his <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> was to be opened on Pastre
Bros., Bankers, at Marseilles, where, shortly after his arrival,
he scraped acquaintance with Monsieur and Madame Grand
Boubagne whom he was soon accused of having robbed of
300 francs. The evidence against him was overwhelming,
and he was condemned to a year in prison for that and other
minor offences, and also sentenced to five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> on
probation.

He served his term and bolted to Constantinople, Arriving
there early in April 1845, he eked out a precarious existence,
first as a kitchen hand, then as the assistant in the shop of an
old apothecary, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> preparations he peddled in the streets
of Galata.
His employer had a friend, a Polish rabbi who, having been
condemned for conspiracy in Russia, had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> refuge in
Constantinople. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a fancy to him and in an effort
to curry favour with the Jews, Lemmi presently asked if he
might be received into the religion of Moses. As a diplomatic
move, the suggestion was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> success for the apothecary
and the rabbi, proud and jubilant to have secured a neophyte,
taught him the Talmud, while another rabbi, Abraham
Maggioro, instructed him in the mysteries of the Cabala.
Together, they initiated him into the secrets of magic, in
which he proved an apt pupil and his lot was much improved,
but the old apothecary died in 1847, and Lemmi found
himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> employment. The Polish rabbi having <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
Constantinople, he stayed on a while under the protection of
his friend Maggioro.
In those days, the few Freemasons coming to Pera were
English. Freemasonry had been introduced into Turkey in
1738, but until the Crimean war it suffered many vicissitudes.
The English saw their lodges fade away for want of active
members, for the government did not favour them. Adriano
Lemmi was supposed to have been initiated into
Freemasonry in 1848 by an English Mason, but this
ceremony seems to have somehow been irregular as it had to
be repeated at a later date.
Finally, the era of his trials seemed to end. In 1849, some
of his English masonic friends gave him a letter of
introduction to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Magyar, Kossuth, who

had come to Constantinople, a fugitive from public
opprobrium in his own country.
To save him from starvation, Kossuth <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> him as his
servant at low wages, but he gradually succeeded in
ingratiating himself with his patron till finally he became his
secretary on the recommendation of Mazzini with whom he
was already in correspondence.
When Kossuth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the United States in 1851, he was
accompanied by Lemmi. They were forced to travel via
Gibraltar and London as the French authorities refused
Kossuth permission to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> in France, and Lemmi, knowing
that he was wanted by the French police, knew better than to
try to do so. In Lodge No. 133 in Cincinnati, U. S. A.,
Kossuth received the masonic initiation.
On the 2nd of December 1851, Prince Louis Napoleon,
then President of the French Republic, announced to the

After 1851, Lemmi began playing an important part in all
politico-masonic assassinations and in all the popular
insurrections of which Italy was the scene. On behalf of
Mazzini, he kept up relations with the revolu1.

On February 6, 1853, an incipient insurrection broke out in
Milan, then under Austrian dominion, as the result of a

Switzerland, under threat of severance of diplomatic
relations, was then obliged to banish indiscriminately all

Then came the Crimean war, the real causes of which were
known only to the chiefs of Freemasonry.
England and Piedmont worked up a quarrel with Russia

Christian Greek and Catholic churches at Jerusalem. This

with the energy necessary for doing their
duty.
The Parma business greatly enhanced the value of
Lemmi in the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of the principal chiefs. He remained
incognito for several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> at SantTlario, but the revolution

with horror, and the widow of Charles III, the daughter of the
Due de Berry, was proclaimed regent for her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Robert, a
child of six.
Still under the false name of Lewis Broom, Lemmi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to

insurrection of July 22, which was quickly suppressed.
In January, 1855, the Piedmontese government suppressed
334 religious institutions at the instigation of the
revolutionary societies which, thanks to complicity under the
guise of tolerance, were unhindered in the development of
their criminal resources.
Lemmi, who had at his disposal as many false papers as
might be necessary for his secret missions, again changed his
name. Armed with a Hungarian passport, belonging to one of
the henchmen of Kossuth, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Rome under the name of
" Ulrick Putsch ", professional cook, and on June 12 there was
an attempt to kill Cardinal Antonelli! He immediately
reappeared at Genoa where, on the thirteenth of the month, a
manifesto was published by Mazzini, inciting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> "to
insurrection. This was spread by Lemmi in several towns,
notably even in Rome where, by a curious coincidence, on
July 9, the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which he returned to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of the

received their instructions, Lemmi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Switzerland with

occur simultaneously with that in Lombardy, was to be
fomented. Orsini was arrested at Hermanstadt, in

<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> treason on August 20, 1855.
Locked up in the castle of San Giorgio, he succeeded in
escaping on the night of March 29th, 1856.
On November 13 of the same year, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other agents of

caused certain confidential papers to be stolen, knew some

King, had been his protector against the machinations of the
secret societies.
Napoleon III, too, allowed himself to be influenced by
Palmerston who, as patriarch of European Freemasonry,
favoured one of his pet projects. This involved the
appointment of Prince Murat, Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of the Grand
Orient of France, to the throne of Naples and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sicilies,

named Baron de Bentivegna, who had been introduced by an
English <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> mason, Henri Misley, to Mazzini in London,
was entrusted with the task of fomenting the trouble, while
Lemmi <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> charge of the murder. According to the plan,
Ferdinand II was to be blown up by a bomb thrown under his

travelled under a French passport, provided for him by a

Everything was ready both in Palermo and Naples. The

revolution were fixed for November 22, but the individual
chosen to perform the deed, Filippo Carabi, suddenly lost
interest in the project when he realized that the bomb
destined for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also inevitably prove fatal to

Lemmi was angry over this unexpected check. It was then
too late to recruit another executioner but the disobedient
Sicilian was eventually punished, for, five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later he was

contain the details of the affair, the sequestration of Carabi in
1861, his accusation before a secret tribunal, the terrible
tortures to which he was subjected and his last horrible agony,
shrouded in mystery.
Lemmi, now unable to have the assassination and the plot
coincide, stayed on nevertheless in Naples, as he hoped to

On the appointed day, November 22, Bentivegna raised
the banner of revolt at Cefalu, near Palermo.

another for the bomb method of assassination, induced a

so, while Ferdinand II was reviewing his troops, Milano
stepped forward and struck him twice in the chest with his
bayonet. Luckily for the king, the instrument bent, failing
even to wound him. Milano was arrested, judged and shot, but
Mazzini, qualifying him as a martyr, had a commemoration
medal struck in his honour.
As for the insurrection in Sicily, it was suppressed,
Bentivegna was captured and shot on December 20, but
Lemmi-Lathuile <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> the country as soon as he realized that

Isaac Artom, 5 while l'Olper, later rabbi of Turin and also the
friend and counsellor of Mazzini, was one of the most open
advocates of Italian Independence.
A few Freemasons in English, French and Prussian
diplomacy alone knew what was being plotted, so the
International Committee of London decreed an upheaval in
Tuscany for the year 1857 and, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that Piedmont might
not be suspected of complicity, it -was arranged that an
insurrection should be staged in that kingdom at the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as the one in Tuscany. That was the comedy !
The insurrection occurred but failed in its object.
In London, the same year, Mazzini hatched a plot against
Napoleon III. It was not the first.
As the French Emperor did not seem sufficiently active on
behalf of Italian Unity, it was decided to stimulate him by
terror. Mazzini, Kossuth and Ledru-Rollin were reinforced in
the committee of London by Herzen, Bakunin, Turr and
Klapka and, early in the year 1857, Paolo Tibaldi, Giuseppe
Bartolotti and Paolo Grilli were chosen by Mazzini and
Ledru-Rollin to kill Napoleon. Massarenti, another tool of
Mazzini's, gave them fifty golden Napoleons when they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
for Paris to perpetrate the crime and, addressing them before
their departure, Mazzini said " You will study the habits of the
Emperor and you will strike when you <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the opportunity

The Piedmontese were not quite satisfied with the results

revolutionaries had attained their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> as far as Tuscany, the

Palmerston's plan was in process of realization.
To Francesco Crispi, a tool of Lemmi, was now assigned

in the poison plot was Monsignor Caputo, a priest who had

popular sentiment. Lemmi was continually running back and
forth from England with instructions from the London
Committee to the local revolutionary chiefs and, in his secret
capacity, was very active through the different assemblies
where the votes of the sold or terrorized members <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> for

Mazzini and Cavour each followed an occult personal and
distinct line of action, the secrets of which they did not share.

Isaac Artom and Carletti and the chief agents of Mazzini
were his Jewish secretaries, Wolf, Lemmi and L'Olper.

banker. His patrons Mazzini and Kossuth were never in want
of money furnished either by England or Masonry. He made
money, practising usury as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> Jew, charging it is said up
to 200 and 300 per cent, but, in politics, he continued as a

a powerful weapon in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of Victor Emmanuel, and

document however, Lemmi induced Crispi in 1893 to arrange
for its disappearance, but this move was forestalled by an
implacable enemy of Lemmi who succeeded in getting possession of the famous paper. 8
In 1867, Lemmi entered into negotiations with the
Freemason Graf von Bismarck and the first projects of
alliance between Prussia and Italy date thenceforth. Lemmi
hated France as much as did Mazzini, so it is not surprising to
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> them both intriguing with Bismarck to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about a
Franco-Italian estrangement.
Napoleon III, by the convention of Sept. 15, 1864, had
established Rome and its surrounding territory as distinct
from the Kingdom of Italy, so that till 1870, the church still
retained this last fragment of its temporal possessions but,
towards 1865, Mazzini organized an association for Italian
Unity, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of which was the Union of these States with
the rest of Italy, with Rome for the capital, according to
Garibaldi's programme. Mazzini however was afraid to go to
Rome <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the consent of France, thinking that the
destruction of the temporal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Pope, in the face of

When the Franco-Prussian war broke out in 1870, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
for revolution was ripe. In July, shortly after the declaration of
hostilities, the Italian revolutionaries held a mass meeting in
the theatre at Milan, organized by the most notorious and
dreaded agitators in Italy. After this public meeting, there was
a secret political one attended by 15 <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> masons. Those
present, according to Oreste Cucchi, who was told of it by
Fabrizi himself, were : Doctor Timoteo Riboli, Francesco
Crispi, Colonel Cucchi, Asproni, Bertani, Fabrizi, Fra-polli,
Cairoli, Rattazzi, Seismit Doda, Morelli, Sineo, Cosentini,
Mancini and General Raffaelo Cadorna. The <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of this
conference was to determine the line of conduct to be adopted
in the event of the defeat of Napoleon's army, and it was
decided to send Cucchi to Bismarck to obtain from the
Prussian government the necessary arms to go to Rome
should Victor Emmanuel persist in his attitude of vacillation.
Cucchi accomplished his mysterious mission, and Bismarck
concluded a deal whereby Prussia was to furnish guns and
money to the Italian revolutionaries, in return for which they
were to keep up agitation to prevent an Italian alliance with
the French nation.
Everything was ready. Still, Victor Emmanuel hesitated.
Public opinion was rapidly being manufactured with the
assistance of Bismarck's money, so the deputies of the <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">Left</span>

"
The government then decided to act, and General Cadorna,
who had already been selected by Freemasonry to lead a
popular army should the government not wish to send him
there in an official capacity, marched on Rome.
The operations of war began on September 15, 1870, and
on September 20, at five o'clock in the morning, the cannon
of Cadorna settled the Roman question. The Porta Pia was
forced. The <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> was accomplished. Freemasonry had
triumphed.
But Freemasonry had won again when, according to Mr.

By this time, Adriano Lemmi had attained prosperity and

Lemmi was appointed by Albert Pike to succeed him as chief

of Rome was absorbed by the Grand Orient of Italy.
All Lemmi now required to complete his victory was to
absorb the Supreme Council of Turin, but Riboli, the only
real and legitimate representative of Italian Freemasonry,
recognized by the Convention of Universal Scottish Rites at
Lausanne, in 1875, and by all the Masonic powers of the
world, had no wish to part with a source of revenue or to
defer to the little Jew at Rome who was invested with no
recognized superior authority.
Lemmi, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> knew that his secret title of Palla-dist
chief assured him eventual supremacy, addressed himself to
the Sovereign Pontiff at Charleston, Albert Pike, to whom he
explained the danger to Italian Masonry of such intense
dissensions and the necessity for fusion in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> struggle
against the Vatican, stating further that the authority of Rome,
the capital of Italy since 1870, must be recognized by the
foreign Masonic powers.
His reasons appealed to the Sovereign Pontiff of Universal
Freemasonry who, in November 1886, entirely disarmed
Riboli by promising him an indemnity of 30,000 francs.
Riboli acquiesced and the money was handed out from the
central fund of the order.
In the Supreme Administrative Directory of Berlin, the
payment of this sum is recorded in the balance sheet of 1887
under the heading of exceptional expenses in the following
terms : 13

balustres demonstrating the legality of the supreme Council

Many Freemasons rallied to his assistance. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

in the fundamental constitution of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> masonry that the
Constitution, Statutes and Regulations of each rite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

The Supreme Council of Lausanne was much embarrassed
inasmuch as, where Scottish Rites was concerned, it was
obliged to admit that Lemmi's opponents were in the right,
and that as a Scottish Rites Mason he, as Petroni's successor,
the Chief of Political Action of secret <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> masonry, was a
rebel.
In an effort to beat the devil around the bush, Riboli and
Tamajo, pretending to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> Lemmi as their temporary
delegate, accepted for themselves the empty honorary title of
Sovereign Grand Commander ad vitam, while Lemmi became
Sovereign Grand Commander delegate invested with the real
power.
Italian Freemasonry was united. A meeting was convened
at Florence in January 1887, by Tamajo and Riboli at which
seven brothers from Rome and seven from Turin, under
orders from Charleston, ratified this agreement.
Lemmi misappropriated masonic funds and profited by his
position to exploit everyone, during which period of frenzied
finance, he pocketed over four hundred <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> francs.
Many complaints of his conduct were sent to the Supreme
Directory at Charleston but while passing through the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>
of Phileas Walder who shared in the loot, anything to
Lemmi's discredit was suppressed, never reaching Pike who
trusted him till the end.
It was in 1881 that Lemmi had embarked on his campaign
for the dechristianization of Italy, giving, under his invisible
direction, an organization to the scattered forces of
anticlericalism. Mazzini had made no mistake for Lemmi
persecuted the church with a savage hatred.
During a Masonic congress held at Milan in 1881, the
following resolutions were adopted : —

Finally the Congress decided to create by masonic initiative one
great, politically non-partisan, anti-clerical party <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>

Adriano Lemmi promptly obeyed Pike's orders and the
resolutions of the Congress which he himself had dictated, by
establishing in Rome on July 13, 1881, ten anticlerical auxiliary
lodges, the foundation expenses of which were paid by the
Supreme Directory of Rome. By his order, similar lodges were
founded in almost every important town of the peninsula.
Lemmi is a Satanist and he organized the anticlerical movement
as a Satanist. 14 Besides his effort to destroy the church, he led a
movement to spread " The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> Cult " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> knowing that the

So Lemmi first preached Lucifer and then fought
Christianity by combating the idea of the supernatural!
All his discourses and manifests were composed either by
Ulisse Bacci, an atheist, or Umberto dal Medico, a
Luciferian.
His instructions to the Italian anticlericals were also put
into operation by the Freemasons of other countries, for the
supreme <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the sect is the suppression, by a terrible
social upheaval, of the religion of God, and its substitution by
that of Satan, known to the dupes of Masonry as " The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
Architect of the Universe. "
On November 21, 1888, Lemmi wrote Pike a letter
appealing for help in his fight against the Vatican. The letter
closed with the following paragraph : —
" Help us in our struggle against the Vatican, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

Europe and America will rally to our cause. "
Pike needed little urging and immediately fell in with
Lemmi's plans.
On March 30th, 1889, the Mother Lodge Archimede <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
the initiative in an effort to shake oif Lemmi's tyrannical yoke
by announcing the formation of " The Masonic Federation of
the Independent Lodges of Italy. " Lemmi was much
perturbed by this effort at secession which he finally
succeeded in crushing by the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of gold. After

the Federation. Soon, the disintegration was complete, the
centre of Palermo vanished and opposition was crushed.
Towards this period, Lemmi got control of the

swindling methods, in acquiring several millions. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

As a result of Lemmi's politics in the elections of 1890, no
decent honest and independent candidate for political
position had a chance of being elected against one of his
hand-picked nominees. Italian politics became a Freemasonic
monopoly and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were mercilessly exploited by the
dregs of <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> backed by Lemmi and his money, much of
which was extorted from the Banca Romana.
On April 2, 1891, Albert Pike died and was succeeded in
the supreme Grand College of Masons by Albert George
Mackey, who held the post for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> and five months.

staff, and Albert George Mackey was chosen as a
compromise candidate who was unlikely to interfere
seriously with any of the others.
With neither strength of character, energy nor activity, he
was no match for Lemmi who aspired to the supreme

to realize this project it was first necessary to create a
movement in the triangular provinces. To this end, he
employed his secret political agents of the Executive
Directory of Rome, practically all of whom were Jews. These
agents were registered in the central directory only by a
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> and a special Masonic name and were unknown even
to the Grand Masters of the provincial lodges as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to the
brothers and sisters at the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of a Lotus Mother Lodge.
His particular agent in London in 1893 was supposed to be
an old Piccadilly Jew <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Daniel Mold. The came under
which he was registered for this Triangular province, in the
Grand Central Directory at Naples, was Adam-Kadzmoun,
the magical value of the letters of which, when added, give
the total of 244 exactly as do the letters of his real name.
Lemmi was not forced to rely solely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his special
agents, for he also had the unanimous support of the powerful
secret Jewish lodges.
By the decree of Sept. 12, 1874, which confirmed a treaty
signed by Armand Levi for the Jewish B'nai B'rith (brothers
of the Alliance) of America, Germany and England and the
supreme authority of Charleston, Albert Pike authorized the
Jewish Freemasons to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a secret federation functioning
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> by <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> with the ordinary lodges. This secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was
to bear the title of Sovereign Patriarchal Council and its
Universal centre was to be at Hamburg, Valentinskamp
Strasse. In subscriptions alone, it collected one million four
hundred <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> francs a year which were <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for general

Under the terms of this document (given in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> on p. 225 of

Gentile Masonry, was not to be graded, its members were
exempt from belonging to any other official rite and " the

members of <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> Masonry who had been informed by the

plans to manufacture the public opinion necessary to the
success of Lemmi's ambitious project were made, and what
actually happened was the result of a plot of the Sovereign
Patriarchal Council of Hamburg against the Supreme
Dogmatic Directory of Charleston.
Hamburg won in the end and the secret Jewish control of
the powerful machine of International Masonry was assured.
The Jewish Lodges were Lemmi's willing tools, and fifty
<span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> Masons, simultaneously Palladists and members of
the Hamburg federation, under orders given by the Jewish
agents in the pay of the Chief of Political action, made over a
period of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months, in the triangles and secret Jewish
lodges, a splendid propaganda calculated to induce discussion
and approval of the transfer of the Supreme Dogmatic
Directory of Charleston to Rome. Everywhere, by every
means, the agents of Lemmi worked indefatigably to create a
demand for the removal of the headquarters of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> from

Vatican could be better fought at close quarters. These
reclamations of a noisy minority were then magnified for the
benefit of the Grand Council of Masons at Charleston into a
threat of imminent secession and, after much manoeuvring,
Phileas Walder succeeded in inducing George Mackey and
the American

Masons to sign the decree convening the Sovereign
Convention. Walder, having remarked that Lemmi was not to
be a candidate for the Supreme Grand Mastership in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> of a vote of transfer of which he maintained there
was no danger, seeing that the majority of the triangles
favoured Charleston as the seat of <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> Masonry, the
American Masons, over confident of the outcome of the
convention, overlooked the importance of the choice of the
town in which it was to meet.
On May 20, 1893, after all the delegates had been elected,
Lemmi suddenly launched his decree of chief organizer
appointing Rome as the convention city.
Had everything been straight, Charleston <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
come out of the trial of the secret Convention with a majority
of 52 votes, for only 25 provinces favoured the move to
Rome, but to Lemmi, all ways, including bribery and crime,
were good.
On the eve of the opening of the Convention, fourteen of
the delegates favouring Charleston were suddenly <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> ill,
and elections for substitute delegates were held in five of the
Grand Triangles but in the remaining nine, the provincial
Grand Masters, owing to lack of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or some other reason,
referred the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> by telegram to Charleston. George
Mackey answered " Send Bovio proxy to provide a European
substitute. "
It was suicide. Bovio, Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> General of the Grand
Central Directory of Naples, and his lieutenants were entirely
devoted to Lemmi in whom George Mackey continued
blindly to confide. The nine sudden illnesses of the American
delegates (the only ones he knew of) had failed to open his
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and he continued counting 52 votes against the transfer !

landed in England in August and were entertained by the
Mother Lodge of the Lotus of England in the secret temple at
32, Oxford Street (Frascati's) were oblivious of the imminent
crisis.
When the Grand Central Directory of Naples received
these proxies, nine Italian delegates were named to represent
Cleveland, Memphis, Guatemala, Havana, Caracas, Lima, La
Paz, Treinta-y-Tres and Port Louis, one of whom abstained
from voting while the rest cynically voted against the wishes
of the province they represented.
The count of the ballots gave the following result out of 77
delegates :
48 delegates for the transfer to Rome,
25 delegates against the transfer to Rome, 4 delegates not
voting the transfer to Rome.
After this essentially fraudulent transfer of the real
masonic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> from Charleston to Rome, the rest was easy.
The ten Masons of Charleston retained their empty titles in
an honorary capacity while Lemmi, now self-styled
Sovereign Pontiff, named ten other active Masons, but owing
to the difficulties attendant on the meetings of these widely
dispersed magnates, he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> a Supreme Triangle, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

In 1895, a schismatic masonic group calling itself the Grand
Orient of Italy was founded. On March 5, 1899, it held a meeting at
which it adopted a constitution of its own after which Lemmi's
Grand Orient and the new one settled down to a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of secret civil

between the various Masonic factions had become so acute that the
profane public had begun to get seriously interested in the Political

The outcome of this dispute was the exposures made in the
following books :

Satan et Cie, by Paul Rosen.
To inaugurate a policy of suppression these revelations were
shown to have been a hoax, a mystification. The manoeuvre was
successful. On the 19th of April, 1897, the author, writing under the
pseudonym of Diana Vaughan, mysteriously disappeared and Leo
Taxil publicly repudiated his own allegations against Freemasonry.

(Founded 1541)

We give the following quotations from the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, in spite of its marked anti-jesuit bias, solely to
register certain historical facts, leaving their interpretation to
the personal judgment of the reader. l
" The Company of the Jesuits was founded by Don Inigo
de Loyola (Ignatius Loyola), a Spanish nobleman and soldier,
on April 5, 1541, at the church of Saint Paul <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
Walls, near Rome, under the sanction of the Pope, Paul III.
" It has six grades. These are novices, scholastics, temporal,
coadjutors, professed of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> vows, and professed of the

confer a share in the government and eligibility for the offices
of the society. Its head, virtually a commander-in-chief, is
known as The General. He wields absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over the

309

The " fourth vow " is one of special allegiance to the Pope
promising to go in obedience to him for missionary purposes
whensoever and whithersoever he may order, — a pledge
seriously qualified in practice, however, by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> given
to the general of alone sending out or recalling any
missionary.
" The question has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been hotly debated whether, in
addition to these six avowed grades, there be not a seventh,
answering in some degree to the Tertiaries of the Franciscan
and Dominican orders, secretly affiliated to the society, and
acting as its unsuspected emissaries in various lay positions.
This class is styled in France ' Jesuits of the short robe ', and
some evidence in support of its actual <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> was alleged
during the lawsuits against the company under Louis XV.
The Jesuits themselves deny the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of any such body,
and are able to adduce the negative disproof that no provision
for it is to be found in their constitutions. On the other hand,
there are clauses therein which make the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of such a
class perfectly feasible if <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> expedient.

given to the general to receive candidates secretly, and to
conceal their admission, for which there is a remarkable
precedent in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Francis Borgia, duke of Gandia,
afterwards himself general of the society; the other is an even
more singular clause, providing for the admission of
candidates to the company by persons who are not themselves
members of it. ... The general, who should by the statutes of
the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> reside permanently at Rome, holds in his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span>
the right of appointment, not only to the office of provincial
over each of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> districts into which the houses are

in Europe must report weekly to their provincial on all

outsiders with whom they may have had dealings of any sort.
The provincial, for his part, must report monthly to the
general, giving him a summary of all details which have
reached himself. But, as a check on him, all superiors of
houses in his province are to make separate reports directly to
the general once in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months, and further to communicate

occurs, irrespective of any information which the provincial
may have forwarded. Nor is this all; an elaborate system of
espionage and delation forms part of the recognized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of

while the superior himself may be similarly delated to the
provincial or the general.
" Nor is the general himself exempt from control on the
part of the society, lest by any possible error he be unfaithful
to its interests. A consultative council is imposed on him by
the general congregation, consisting of six persons, whom he
may neither select nor remove, — namely, four assistants,
each representing a nation, an admonisher or adviser
(resembling the adla-tus of a military commander) to warn
him of any faults or mistakes, and his confessor. One of these
must be in constant attendance on him; and, while he is not at
liberty to abdicate his office, nor to accept any dignity or
office outside it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the assent of the society, he may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in common with the other professed. But such is the
extraordinary skill with which the relations of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> to
the papacy were originally drafted by Loyola, and
subsequently worked by his successors, that it has always
remained organically independent, and might very

was Ignatius Loyola himself who procured its erection in
Portugal in 1545-6, and F. Nithard, one of the very few

reported to Rome by Norbert, a Capuchin, and by the bishop
of Rosalia and was vainly censured in the pontifical briefs of
Innocent X in 1645, Clement IX in 1669,Clement XII in 1734
and 1739, and Benedict XIV, in 1745. The ' Chinese rites ',
assailed with equal unsuccess by 9 popes, were not finally put
down until 1744, by a bull of Benedict XIV... By these rites
the Jesuit missionaries had virtually assimilated Christianity
to heathenism> and their practical reply in opposition to a
papal decree in 1700 was to obtain an edict from the emperor
of China declaring that there was nothing idolatrous or
superstitious in the inculpated usages, while in 1710 they
flung Cardinal Tournon, legate of Clement XI, into the prison
of the Inquisition at Macao, where he perished. Finally, they
disobeyed the brief of suppression issued by Clement XIV in

To quote the Encyclopedia further :

From the Jesuit College at Ingolstadt is said to have issued
the sect known as " The Illuminati of Bavaria " founded by
Adam Weishaupt under the guidance of Nicolai, in 1776.
Weishaupt, its nominal founder, however, seems to have
played a subordinate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> conspicuous role in the

The well-known authority on theocratic organizations,
Heckethorn, writes the following concerning the Jesuits : '
There is considerable analogy between Masonic and Jesuitic
degrees ; and the Jesuits also tread down the shoe and bare the

" Not satisfied with confession, preaching, and instruction,
whereby they had acquired unexampled influence, they
formed in Italy and France, in 1563 several ' Congregations ',
i. e. clandestine meetings held in subterranean chapels and
other secret places. The congregationists had a sectarian
organization, with appropriate catechisms and manuals,
which had to be given up before death, wherefore very

remain.
To show the further similarity of the Jesuit-JudaicMasonic-Gnostic-Brahmin-Illuminati theology we now
quote from a MS. in the library of the Rue Richelieu
at Paris entitled Histoire des congregations et socialites
jesuitiques depuis 1563 jusqu'au temps present (1709). 5

some of the ceremonies with which aspirants were initiated
into the Order. Having in nearly all Roman Catholic countries
succeeded in becoming the educators of the young, they were
able to mould the youthful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> according to their secret aims.
If then, after a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of years, they detected in the pupil a
blind and fanatic faith, conjoined with exalted pietism and
indomitable courage, they proceeded to initiate him; in the
opposite case, they excluded him. The proofs lasted
twenty-four hours, for which the candidate was prepared by

apparatus of the ancient mysteries. If the neophyte, who was
closely watched, showed <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> or terror, he remained for ever
in the inferior degree ; but if he bore the proof well, he was
advanced to a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> grade.
" At the initiation into the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> degree (Scholas-tici) the
same proofs, but on a grander scale, had to be undergone. The
candidate, again prepared for them by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> fastings, was led
with his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> bandaged into a large cavern, resounding with
wild howlings and roarings, which he had to traverse, reciting
at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> prayers specially appointed for that occasion.
At the end of the cave he had to crawl through a narrow
opening, and while doing this, the bandage was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from his
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> by an unseen hand, and he found himself in & square

and skeletons ranged around. This was the Cave of Evocation,
the Black Chamber, so famous in the annals of the Fathers.
Here, giving himself up to prayer, the neophyte passed some
time, during which the priests could, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his being aware

forehead with a white band soaked with blood, and covered
with hieroglyphics; they then hung a small crucifix round his
neck, and a small satchel containing relics, or what did duty
for them. Finally, they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> off all his clothing, which they

point, the hierophant with his assistants entered and, having
bound a red cloth round the middle of the candidate's body,
the brethren, clothed in bloodstained garments, placed
themselves beside him, and drawing their daggers, formed the
steel arch over his head. A carpet being then spread on the
floor, all knelt down and prayed for about an hour, after
which the pyre was secretly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> ; the further wall of the

<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the following oath : —' In the name of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> crucified, I

of my birth, henceforth to exist in another sphere. I swear to
reveal to my new superior, whom I <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know, what I
have done, thought, read, learnt, or discovered, and to observe
and watch all that comes under my notice. I swear to yield
myself up to my superior, as if I were a corpse, deprived of

may be. '

introduced into a neighbouring cell, where he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> a bath, and
was clothed in garments of new and white linen. He finally
repaired with the other brethren to a banquet, where he could

THE DEFENDERS
(ROMAN CATHOLIC)

(Founded 1562)

This Irish Catholic organization, similar to that of the
Spanish Guarduna, was founded in 1562 by Roger Moore
behind whom were French and Spanish Jesuits.
According to Captain Pollard, author of The Secret
Societies of Ireland, " The nominal function of the Defenders
was the protection of the fugitive priests during the period of
proscription and the holding of the passes while Mass was
celebrated in some mountain glen. The enemies of the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span>
being the Protestants, and the Protestants standing for the
Constitutional authority of Britain, the Defenders soon
became a criminal association of law-breakers and banditti.
";
In 1641 they rose and massacred many Protestants, but
were duly crushed by Cromwell in 1649.
This Irish Catholic element was already opposed by the
Roman Catholic Archbishop Plunket, of whom Captain
Pollard writes : " Archbishop Oliver Plunket, Roman
Catholic Primate of Ireland, who had attempted to put down
the criminal association of Defenders in

the South of Ireland, was accused by the infamous Oates; and
at his trial at Westminster certain of these Irish priests, who
had been censured by him, gave false evidence against him.
The Archbishop, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> innocent, was, through the false

the original <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> of Defenders ; in common with its
ancestor it attempts to enable the clerics to exercise control in
politics.1 It claims in its own official history, published in
1910, to be the oldest secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> in Ireland. Independent
researches show that the claim is sound and that the present A.
0. H. is the descendant of certain criminal organizations of
the past. The open admission of this chain of descent by its
own historian is important. American sources trace the A. 0.
H. to 1565 but the date 1641 is that more commonly accepted.

" The Jesuit influence in the development of the Defenders
was reinforced, and their ceremonies and symbolism slowly
changed to an elementary ritual

JANSENISM
(Founded 1638)

This was a peculiar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Calvinism inaugurated by
Cornelius Jansenius (1585-1638) from Louvain in the
Netherlands.
The doctrine of Jansenism is exposed in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Augustinus, <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by Jansenius, and published after his

According to Jansenius' theory of Predestination, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was
either saved or damned according to God's own will,
regardless of his merits or demerits.
From the Low Countries, Jansenism penetrated into France
and its chief centre was in the Port Royal abbey near Paris. It
was Duvergier de Hauranne who had been a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> friend of
Jansenius during their student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> who, as abbot of Saint
Cyran, introduced Jansenism into Port Royal.
Antoine Arnauld was the leader of the Jansenists and was
followed by Pasquier Quesnel. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> minds of the
seventeenth century were Jansenists, among them Le Maitre
de Sacy, Blaise Pascal, Lancelot, Nicole and Fontaine,
Secretary of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> of Louis XV.
Jansenism, which had undergone severe treatment in
France under Louis XIV, revived under the Regency

in 1715, and found supporters among the learned and the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span>
clergy against the policy of the Pope.
It is during this period that among the Jansenist sectarians
there arose the strange occurrences practised by what is
known as the Convulsionaries of St. Medard.
The Jansenist party was very rich thanks to the boite a
Perrette (Perrette's box). This was a special fund whence
Jansenism <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> out all the money for its political and other
needs. It had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> its name from the servant of Mr. Nicole, a
leading Jansenist, who had started the fund and confided the
care of it to his servant. In 1778 it amounted already to 1100
livres and in 1865 was still very substantial.
Modern Jansenism, which, since the 18th century, had its
chief seat in the Netherlands, principally Utrecht, joined in
1889 the German party of the Old Catholics founded in 1871
which, supported by Bismarck, had been one of the elements
leading him to his Kul-1 turkampf policy against the Catholic
Church and institutions.

CAMISARDS OF THE CEVENNES
(Originating 1688)
The Camisards were actually a survival of the Wal-1 denses
and the Pastoureaux.
Calmeil, an authority on mental aberrations quoted by
Madden in Phantasmata1', <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> describes the characteristics
of the Camisard movement: — " The prophetic madness (of
the Camisards) made its appearance in Dauphine and Vivarais
in 1688 ; it very soon spread itself over a vast <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
places, and continued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any interruption among the
Calvinists for nearly twenty years.
" It was especially in the course of the year 1689, that the
phenomena of theomania excited the greatest astonishment
and rose to the height of its violence. The theomaniacs could
then be counted by hundreds ; men, women, girls, boys,
young children, all of them believed they were inspired and
imbued with the breath of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit.

of the pretended prophets, the military executions, all the

of this religious fanaticism, only augmented the force of the

" When, towards the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the Calvinists rose up in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> earnest to constitute small
bodies of troops, and to dispute inch by inch the soil which
had given them birth, with the king's soldiery, by whom they
were confronted, this war of extermination was preceded by
the apparition of a sort of swarm of pretended prophets and
prophetesses. Towards 1701, at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred of the
inspired, who had fallen into the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of their enemies, were
sent to the galleys.
" The madness of the theoma,niacs was less talked of

with respect and kindness ; but they soon forfeited all claim to
respect by the folly or knavery of their conduct. Of this group
Elias Marion was the prominent figure ; the others acting only
subordinate parts. He loudly proclaimed that he was the
messenger of Heaven, and was authorised to denounce
judgments, and to look into futurity. All kinds of arts were

Swedberg's family was ennobled by Queen Ulrika and his

Emmanuel Swedenborg was initiated at Lund in 1706 and
progressed to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> degrees of the Templars as practised
in Sweden.

SUPREME CONSEIL AND GRAND ORIENT DE
FRANCE
(Founded 1725)
SOVEREIGN GRAND COMMANDER,
SUPREME CONSEIL
1929,
M. RENE RAYMOND.

Freemasonry was introduced in France in about 1730,
some say 1725.
Its implantation bore a singular character. Due to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
of exile spent in France by Queen Henrietta, widow of
Charles I (1649), English ways and customs had become
fashionable among the members of the French aristocracy.
The exiled English Royal Family and their adherents, warmly
welcomed by the Jesuits of France, plotted in secret to regain
the throne for Charles II. Later, when the Catholic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>
James II was also overthrown in 1688, he found refuge in
France and his son, The Pretender, and later his grandson,
Charles Edward, headed numerous plots fomented to enable
them to regain their father's and grandfather's throne from
William of Orange.
Meanwhile Masonry had been instituted in England (1717)
and introduced in France in 1730. The Jacobites, partisans of
the Pretender, secretly plotting as

they constantly were, found the newly <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> Masonic

the Jesuits' colleges whence all their schemes emanated.
Lodges, having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> become fashionable resorts for French
aristocrats, presented a double aspect, one which might
almost be termed theatrical, inasmuch as the comedy of
equality between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and his varlet was enacted in the
Lodge, and the other far more serious was of a political
character. This latter aspect of budding English symbolic
Freemasonry in France was anxiously watched by the
minister Cardinal de Fleury who ordered its suppression in
1737. Up to that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the French lodges that had been formed
considered themselves as depending from the English Grand
Lodge, had an English Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> and were confining their
activities to the practice of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> grades of Blue Masonry.
Then appeared the would-be reformers of Masonry. At
their head, in France, was the Chevalier de Ramsay, and with
their advent came the innovation of a fourth grade followed
by others. This was the beginning of Scotch Masonry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
unavowed aim seems to have been to interpose itself between
the existing Lodges and the governing Grand Lodge of
France.
De Ramsay, who was one of the foremost exponents of
Scotch Rites and already dreamed of the Universal Masonry
of Albert Pike, exposed some of his theories in his famous
Discourse made in 1740.
By that time, the Grand Lodge of France, known as the
Grand English Lodge of France, was no longer headed by an
English Grand Master, but by the Due d'Antin who was
succeeded by Louis, Prince de Bourbon, Comte de Clermont,
who held the office of Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> from 1743 until 1771.

what might be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an offshoot of the Primitive French
Masonry on which, later, the Chevalier de Bonneville grafted
some additional degrees. This name " <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> of Clermont "
has been the cause of much confusion arising from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that a Jesuit college founded in Paris, in 1550, also bore the
name of Clermont College and had been a centre for Jacobite
secret plotting against the Protestant rulers of England.1
This grafting of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> degrees on those of Symbolic or
Blue Masonry gave Scotch Masonry its vitality and strength
and a continual superposition and absorption of one rite, to
and by another, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> place.
The period during the Grandmastership of the Comte de
Clermont was eventful for the craft. A masonic writer,
William H. Peckham, in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on Scottish rites, gives a
succinct but clear sequence of some of the changes undergone
by Masonry in France mentioning Thory, Le Blanc, de
Marconnay, Ragon and Clavel as his sources. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we learn
that the English Grand Lodge of France became the " Grande
Loge du Royaume " in 1756, and declared itself independent;
further, that an inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> known as the Supreme Council of
the Emperors of the East and West had been founded in 1754
by the Chevalier de Bonneville. It had its chamber in the
Grand Lodge of France and, likewise, was under the authority
of the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
1. Rev. E. Cahill, S. J., Freemasonry and the Anti-Christian Movement, p.
213, definitely refutes the story of certain Masonic authorities by whom it
has been alleged that The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> of Clermont was founded in the Jesuit
College of that name. He states that it was " founded in 1754 and was

an independent Grand Lodge. Both these Grand Lodges, as

Stephen Morin, had obtained a charter from the Council of the

known as Scottish Bites. Morin held his authority from the
Comte de Clermont who, at the request of Lacorne, charged
him with establishing Masonry in all parts of the world. His

degrees was established at Namur in 1770 by Marchot and in

thoroughly revived, than French masonry again suffered from
an invasion of mysticism, — first in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Scottish

as Napoleon disliked the constitution of the Supreme Council
which was largely influenced by the aristocracy. His brother,
Joseph, assisted by Murat and Cambaceres, was allowed to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> office in the older organization. During the reactionary
Catholic policy of the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Murat the younger
(1852-62), the liberties of the Orient were greatly interfered
with and its funds almost exhausted. Since then it has slowly
recovered. 5
Murat was succeeded by General Magnan who had been
appointed by Napoleon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> to group all Masonic bodies into

Scottish Rites, then under Jean Baptist Viennet, which still
held aloof.

Alliance Israelite Universelle became merged in the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of

THE CONVULSIONARIES OF ST. MEDARD (Founded
1731)
St. Medard was the name of a cemetery in Paris wherein
was the tomb of a famous Jansenist, the deacon Francois de
Paris, and it was said that miracles of all descriptions <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there.
The first recorded <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of convulsions in the St. Medard
cemetery occurred in August 1731.
On this subject, Madden tells us the following : —
" The tomb of the deacon Francois became the scene of
wonderful cures, and some very remarkable conversions,
which were reputed miraculous. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who came there,
especially afflicted with nervous disorders, appear to have
been affected in a singular manner, some with cataleptic,
others with hysteric and convulsive symptoms. l
" The convulsionnaires exhibited not only occasionally,
but frequently, all the phenomena which are ascribed by
mesmerists to animal magnetism, somnambulism, ecstasies,
raptures, submission of the will and the senses to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of

heightened powers of imagination, a vivid energizing

in the army, and to several others. The <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
afflicted with convulsions increased so fast, and
consequences of the meetings at the tomb appeared, or were

churchyard belonging to St. Medard's parish, where M. de

THE CONVULSIONARIES OF ST.

MEDARD

345

" Towards the end of the year 1732, those who were jn
convulsions began to foretell what was to happen, to discover
secrets, to make speeches, pathetic exhortations, sublime
prayers; even those who at other times were wholly unable to
perform any such things. 2
" Montgeron informs us : ' There is nothing which the
convulsionnaires did not undertake to mortify themselves, to
break down and to enfeeble their bodies. The most of those
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they had convulsions, hardly made <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of a bed;
they laid down with their clothes on, winter and summer, with
only one covering, some lying on planks, and others on the
bare ground, others on logs of wood, and some of them on
bars of iron. '
" The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is, not only the means <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for effecting cures
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in themselves, but many of the leading persons by
whom the remedy of the Grand Secours was administered or
superintended were persons of ill repute. 3
" Montgeron reckons that four <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> enthusiasts were
employed to kick, and to strike <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> cessation the infirm,
and all those young girls who begged for the violence of their
blows. ' They were not ashamed to maintain' says Calmeil '
that it was to be ignorant of pious and charitable duties, not to
obey under these circumstances the desires of the
convulsionnaires whilst the reasonable Jansenists repeated
aloud, that it was only a frantic madness which could suggest
to these young women to encounter such dangers, and make
an excuse for the criminal barbarity of those who had the
audacity to boast of the advantages of so scandalous a mode
of mortification, or rather martyr

' The convulsionnaire continued to complain that the blows
that I was giving her were so slight that they did not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> her

reply, they said to him — Come and verify the facts — He
hastened to do so, and at the very sight he was struck with
astonishment. Scarcely believing his eyes, he begs to

his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> the iron instruments, the strongest and the fittest to
beat effectually ; He spared nothing, he struck with the
greatest violence, he thrust into the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> the instrument with
which he was armed, he made it penetrate beyond the surface...
Notwithstanding which, the convulsionnaire laughed at all his

the Calvinist convulsionnaires progressed in their fanaticism
in the Cevennes, when they were interfered with by the civil
authorities ; and many of their chiefs were imprisoned, as
those of the Jansenists of St. Medard were immured in the
Bastille, and the Bicetre. The plea or the pretext of
persecution, and the consequent assemblage of the
convulsionnaires of Paris in secret, concurred greatly and
rapidly to augment the evils which it was intended to prevent
by those governmental measures. And those evils were not
effectually repressed during the following ten years. Nor were
they totally then put a stop to. It was of no avail that, in the
year 1762, the ' Grand Secours ' was forbidden by act of
parliament.

(Founded 1751-52)
The following main facts concerning the Strict Observance
are mostly gathered from the profusely documented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
R. Le Forestier who, having made a comprehensive study of
the subject, <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> as one of his chief authorities Nettelbladt.
The Templar rite of the Strict Observance was founded in
1751 by Charles Gotthelf, Baron de Hund (born 1722)
Chamberlain and Councillor of the Elector of Saxony, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>

Theresa.
In 1764, the Anglo-Jewish adventurer Leucht, variously
known as Johnson, de Martin, Robert de Leich-ten, Becher,
Despocher, de Bousch, Somery, Scheel and Koenig, made an
attempt to amalgamate the Templar System of Clermont, the
control of which he had seized the previous year from Rosa,
with that of von Hund, with the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of dominating the latter
also. In this he failed.
Rosa had been the Legate for Germany, Holland and the
kingdoms of the north while, in Paris, the Comte de Clermont
occupied a similar position with regard to France, Spain,
Portugal and Italy.

According to Le Forestier, again quoting Nettel-bladt, the
initiation ceremony ot the Strict Observance included the
presentation to the postulant of a ribbon to which was
appended a small cross which had been in contact with the
Baphomet.2
At the Convent, sitting from June 4 to 24, 1772, at Kohlo in
the Basse Lusace, it was decided to refuse further obedience

ILLUMINATI

OF

AVIGNON

(Founded 1760)

The Illuminati of Avignon were founded in 1760 by
Antoine Joseph Pernety, an unfrocked Benedictine, a Cabalist
and alchemist. Modified in 1766 by Chas-tanier, one of the
founders of the English Rite of Swedenborg, this rite was
introduced into Paris in the Lodge Socrates of Perfect Union
under the name of Theosophical Illumines. In 1770, Pernety,
founded La Grande Loge Ecossaise du Comtat Venaissin.
This Lodge was raided in 1774 and its papers confiscated by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the Pope. It was revived in 1789 \
Among its members were Cagliostro and his friend Baron
de Corberon, Mesmer, Marquis de Thome and the Marquis de
Puysegur, self-styled Professor of " Mesmerism ".
In Les Illumines d'Avignon by Joanny Bricaud (page 103)

annexation of the Grand Central Lodge to the Antient and
Accepted Scottish Rite among those recognized by the
Grand Orient. " 4
In 1804, in France, a Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand
Inspectors General of the 33rd degree of the Antient and
Accepted Scottish Rite was duly constituted. In the
construction of this Council, Comte Alexandre F. A. de
Grasse-Tilly, (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the Admiral) played a leading part.
He had been initiated in Paris several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to
America where we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> him a colonist of San Domingo.
His successor was the Due Decazes.
As regards the development of Scottish Rites in England,
Stillson and Hughan <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that : —
" After the Antient and Accepted Scottish Rite had been
established in England, the Templar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> resigned control
over the degrees of the ' Rose-Croix ' and ' Kadosch, ' which
then became incorporated with the rite, as the 18th and 30th ;

relegate them to Templar history, but they were still retained
in some of the older English encampments.
A revised ritual was issued in 1851 consequent on the
omission of the ' Rose-Croix ' and ' Kadosch '. 5
Another authority, Paul Rosen, makes the following
comment : —
" The philosophy of the degree of Kadosch (30°), the
apotheosis and real aims of Masonic teaching, can be summed
up in the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> : — I, I alone, All mine, All for me,

(Founded 1763)
Pope Clement XIV having excommunicated the
Freemasons in 1763, many German Catholics, frightened by
the Papal Bull, definitely renounced the society.
They formed however another association which, while
restoring their former organization, should not expose them to
the censure of the Vatican and, having found a protector in the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of one of the most august German Sovereigns of the
day, they secured an influential German nobleman as Grand
Master. Many distinguished persons joined the " new " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
which, like the Freemasons, had laws, words, signs of recognition, reception ceremonies and appointed officers.
One of the principal lodges was at Frankfort.
Adherence to the Roman Catholic <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> was declared a
requisite of membership, but the rule was not enforced and as
a protection from papal excommunication a promise, instead
of an oath of secrecy, was exacted from candidates.
Women were eligible to any dignity in the order, excepting
that of Grand Master, which position was held for life. There

" Mingled with points clearly stolen from the Masonic
ritual, such as the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the square and compasses, was the
veneration of a sort of mascot which was a dog, known as the
Mopse, and resembled a rather large pug dog with a curly tail.
" During the ceremony the candidates were admitted
blindfolded and were instructed to kiss something. This was
nothing more nor less than a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> sized model of a mopse, and

were merely boisterous fooling, or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they had any

This rite was founded in 1766 by Zinnendorf, the chief
surgeon of the general staff of Berlin and a Knight
Commander in von Hund's Strict-Observance. Zinnendorf
received the rituals and instructions for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> from a
Swede named Cklack.
On Dec. 27 1770, Zinnendorf formed a Grand Lodge in
Berlin with the cooperation of twelve lodges which had
adopted his opinions. On March 29 of the following year, he
demanded a constitution from the Grand Lodge of London.
This he finally obtained in 1773 through the influence of
Prince Louis George Charles of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Grand

This <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> seems to have borne a close resemblance to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of the Golden Cross which was reorganized in
1767.
According to Le Forestier, Illuminism was just as much
Masonry as the system of the Rose Croix, that of the
Templars or the crowd of Masonic French degrees, and it is
wrongfully accused of having <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in Bavaria the cloak of
Masonry.1
The intention of the Founder was to constitute a Protestant
organization to fight Jesuitism, using Jesuitical methods. He
was ably assisted in his efforts by Adolph, Baron von Knigge,
Massenhausen, Bode, Anacharsis Clootz, Fischer, Zwack,
Merz, Hertal, the Marquis de Constanza, Count Saviola,
Bassus, Baron de Montgelas and Nicolai.
Behind Nicola'i was <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Mendelssohn, and behind
Mendelssohn the Jewish Kahal, the Jewish International
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> Government. 2
" Nicola'i had established about the year 1765 at Berlin a
literary review with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of propagating the pernicious
doctrines of a shallow Illuminism, and, in that, the infancy of
German literature, when this periodical had scarcely a rival to
encounter, the influence it exerted was more extensive than
can at present be even conceived. Bahardt and Basedow, at
the same time, in cheap and popular tracts, scattered among
the lower classes the poison of infidelity ; and they, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
Nicola'i, were in close communication with Weishaupt,
carrying on with the most reckless violence, and with the
weapons of a most shameless ribaldry, the warfare
against Christianity.

literature, lent his powerful support to the anti-Christian
League. While librarian at Wolfenbuttel he edited a work,
composed by Reimarus, consisting of various irreligious
essays entitled Fragments of Wolfenbuttel, and which, from
the tone of earnestness and dialectic acuteness wherein they
were written, exerted a very prejudicial influence over public
opinion. "3
As the organization of the Illuminati developed, so did its
ambitions, which ended in a plot to subvert Freemasonry to
its aim of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> dominion by any and all means.
Politically speaking, its tendencies were republican ;
religiously, it was anti-christian. Its members were pledged to
blind obedience to their superiors and this was insured by a
strict system of secret confessions, and monthly reports
checked by mutual espionage. Each individual <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> a
pseudonym instead of his own name to help disguise his
identity.
But for the Freemason Baron Adolph von Knigge, a
Templar, who succeeded in having it absorbed by
Freemasonry, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have perished soon after its
creation.
After obtaining control of certain Masonic Lodges,
Weishaupt and his associates recklessly vaunted their
growing power. Their organization then, soon becoming
permeated by the agents of their enemies, the Jesuits and
Rose Croix Orders, they were denounced to the Elector of
Bavaria, Charles Theodore, by the Duchess Marie-Anne of
Bavaria (Princess Clementine), his cousin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> secretary,

On March 2, 1785, the Elector wrote his <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> and final
edict, suppressing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the Illuminati, but it was not
until July 10, 1785 that incriminating evidence was obtained
on the activities of the sect when one of its members, a priest,
Jacob Lang, was struck dead by lightning while walking with
Weishaupt at Ratisbon. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was placed in the chapel of
Saint-Emmeran and a Benedictine found some documents
and a list of the members of the Illuminati sewn in his clothes.
These he handed over to the Councillor of the Government of
Upper Bavaria.
More papers were found when the authorities, who were
watching Zwack's relations with a certain Jew, Mayer, the
superintendent of Bassus' chateau of San-dersdorf, near
Ingolstadt, decided to raid the place, and in 1787 the judge
charged with the inventory of the succession of the valet of
Baron Maendl, the Chamberlain of the Elector, found among
his effects an iron box <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of papers concerning the
Illuminati.
This discovery, Maendl, himself an Illuminatus, was
summoned to explain. Among the details of his evidence is
the statement that the Lodge Bader had 97 degrees. The
coincidence of this <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> becomes of interest when
compared with the 97 degrees of Memphis sent to England
in 1762 by the Grand Orient of France.
When Weishaupt was banished from Bavaria by his
sovereign, he was received at the court of the Duke
Ernest-Louis de Saxe-Gotha who, besides a pension, gave
him the title of Honorary Councillor.

" The Illuminati did not disappear after the last century. They are
still to be found in Germany, England and Russia where they have
formed a queer sect in which castration is one of the features of
initiation. The taste for the supernatural, the passion of the marvellous constantly urge these mentally unbalanced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in whom

(Founded 1786)

The name of Tugendbund or Union of Virtue was first
given to the association of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women who met at the

Herz, a Jewish Illuminatus, was the disciple, friend and
successor of <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Mendelssohn. Noted Illuminati were
frequenters of this abode of licentiousness about which
Graetz, the Jewish historian, wrote :
" The salon of the beautiful Henrietta Herz became a sort of
Midianite tent. Here a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of young Jewish women
assembled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> husbands were kept away by their business.
The most prominent male member of this circle was
Frederick von Gentz, the embodiment of selfishness,
licentiousness, vice and depravity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> chief occupation

forming, and to whom the Jews owed so much during his
secret diplomatic embassy (1786) to Berlin, was more in the
<span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> of Henrietta Herz than in that of her husband. "
Other frequenters of this salon were William von
Humboldt, Jean Paul Richter, Schleiermacher, a foremost
Moravian brother, and his friend Frederick Schlegel.
Later, in 1807, a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Tugendbund or Union of Virtue
was formed, a purely political league of which Thomas Frost
wrote : —
" The nucleus of the Association devised by von Stein
which received the name of the Tugendbund, or League of
Virtue, was formed during the latter months of 1807. His
colleagues, Hardenberg and Scharnhorst; Generals
Wittgenstein and Blucher ; Jahn, a Professor of the Berlin
Gymnasium, and Arndt, the popular author, were amongst the
earliest members. The initiations multiplied rapidly, and the
League soon numbered in its ranks most of the Councillors of
State, many officers of the army, and a considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
the professors of literature and science. By the active and
zealous exertions of Stein, Hardenberg and Jahn, its
ramifications spread quickly from the Baltic to the Elbe, and
all classes were drawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> its influence. A central
directorate at Berlin, presided over by Stein, had the supreme
control of the movement, and exercised, through provincial
committees, an authority all the more potent from emanating
from an unknown source, and which was obeyed as implicitly
as the decrees of Emperor or King. " 3

OCCULT THEOCRASY

With Heckethorn, we follow the Tugendbund further,
for he tells us that after its suppression by the police of
Napoleon I, the Tugendbund continued " concealing
itself however more strictly than before in the masonic
brotherhood. " 4
One of its first acts " was to send auxiliary corps to assist
the Russians in the campaign of 1813. Prussia having, by the
course of events, been compelled to abandon its temporizing
policy, Gneisenau, Scharn-horst and Grollmann embraced
the military plan of the Tugendbund. A levy en masse was
ordered. The conduct of these patriots is <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of history.
But, like other nations, they fought against Napoleon to
impose on their country a more tyrannical government than
that of the foreigner had ever been. They fought as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> only

the dawn of German freedom. But those who survived saw
how much they were deceived. The Tugendbund, betrayed in
its expectations, was dissolved ; but its members increased
the ranks of other societies already existing, or about to be
formed " such as the ' Black Knights ' under Jahn, ' The
Knights of the Queen of Prussia ', ' The Concor-dists ' under
Dr. Lang and the Deutscher Bund, founded in 1810."
The Tugendbund was revived in the Burschens-chaft, or
associations of students of the universities, where they
introduced gymnastics and martial exercises, but the
organization was broken up and its objects frustrated, after
the stabbing of Kotzebue by a student. It revived between
1830-33. It is said to have failed again.

founded a Lodge in Paris in 1786 which was duly "

was the Club Breton which afterwards became known as the
Jacobin Club, a name of Templar origin, recalling that of
Jacques de Molay.

available at that date for revolution.
" In his Nouvelles Historiques et considerations poli-tiques
sur la Revolution Frangaise (1793) the Swiss Girtaner, an
ex-freemason who had joined the ranks of the enemies of the
sect, states that, from 1786, there had existed in Paris a

end of 1791, these had increased to thirty millions. " 1
The conspiracy formed by Philippe of Orleans (Due de

leaders. That they in turn were controlled by a small clique is
obvious. Even the 300 masonic leaders of the French
Revolution of 1793 seem to have had their successors in
modern history — Rathenau mentioned them in his works.
One of the most interesting episodes of the French
Revolution was that known as the Conspiracy of Babeuf.
Babeuf formed the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of the Pantheon which, according
to Professor Laski, 6 was operated by " a secret committee of

Darthe, Sylvain Marechal, Germain and Buonarroti, who was

The particular brand of communism favoured by the
conspirators was based on the theory that the poor could not
help themselves or improve their position, that the rich must
be suppressed and that the ideal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>

THE UNITED IRISHMEN
(Founded 1791)
In 1791, the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of The United Irishmen was founded
by Theobald Wolfe Tone and Napper Tandy, both of whom
were <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> in rank in the Masonic lodges. The organization
sought to unite Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to throw off the oppressive yoke of England or, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the
graphic language of Tone himself, " to subvert the tyranny of
our execrable government, to break the connection with
England, the never-failing source of all our political evils,
and to assert the independence of my country — these were
my objects. To unite the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Ireland. " l
The priesthood and the nobles however stood solidly
behind the English <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> ; but the social conditions imposed
by England on its Irish-Catholic subjects rendered that
country a fertile soil for the sowing of the Revolutionary seed.
These disabilities are described by Lecky in the following
article which appeared in Macmillan's Magazine, January,
1873.
" To sum up briefly their provisions, they (the English)
excluded the Catholics from the Parliament,

one-third of the rent. A Catholic, except in the linen trade,
could have no more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> apprentices. He could not have
a horse of the value of more than £5, and any Protestant on
giving him £5 might <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> his horse. He was compelled to pay
double to the militia. In <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of war with a Catholic Power,
he was obliged to reimburse the damage done by the enemy's
privateers. To convert a Protestant to Catholicism was a
capital offence. No Catholic might marry a Protestant.
Into his own family circle the elements of dissension were
ingeniously introduced. A Catholic landowner might not
bequeath his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> as he pleased. It was divided equally

that The United Irishmen and The Illuminati bore one another
a close resemblance and, in his Diary, Wolfe Tone himself
refers frankly to having on " several occasions pressed his
friends the Jacobins to try to extend their clubs through the
North. " 2
The history of the United Irishmen is largely the history of
Theobald Wolfe Tone.
In a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> to page 77 of his Autobiography, we are given the
following information concerning the origin of The United
Irishmen. "Before Tone's arrival in Belfast a political club,
composed of Volunteers, and directed by a Secret Committee,
was in existence. Among the members of the club were
Neilson,3 Russell, the Simses, Sinclair, McTier and Macabe
after which Tone remarks " Mode of doing business by a
Secret Committee, who are not known or suspected of
co-operating, but who, in fact, direct the movements of
Belfast. "

ceeds to make the following observation : — « The enormous
influence of the French revolution had begun to make itself

from France aimed at bringing England low, and spreading
the doctrine of world-revolution by means of an alliance
between the Catholic malcontents of the south and the
Republican Presbyterians of the north. "
Suppressed in 1794, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> had reorganized in 1795 as a
secret republican revolutionary <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> with subordinate
societies and committees and had absorbed that of The
Defenders.
John Keogh was the leader of the Roman Catholic branch
of the movement among the other supporters of which were
Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Robert Emmett, Thomas Addis

In 1795, having become seriously implicated in the
treasonable activities of the Rev. William Jackson, an
emissary of the French Government to the Irish Revolutionaries, Tone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to America where he saw the French
Minister Citizen Adet. With his approval and instructions,
Wolfe Tone sailed for France on Jan. 1, 1796 where he spent
the remainder of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> planning the downfall of England.
He held that " unless they can separate England from Ireland,
England is invulnerable. " 4
From the beginning of his French intrigues, he feared
treason to his cause and, in his diary, we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the following
entry dated March 21, 1796, quoting General Clark in a
conversation he had just had with him :

" Even in the last war when the volunteers were in force " said
the General " and a rupture between England and Ireland
seemed likely, it was proposed in the French Council to offer
assistance to Ireland, and overruled by the interest of Comte
de Vergennes, then Prime Minister, who received for that
service a considerable bribe from England, and that he
(General Clark) was informed of this by a principal agent in
paying the money. So, it seems, we had a narrow escape of
obtaining our independence fifteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. It is better as it
is for then we were not united amongst ourselves, and I am
not clear that the first <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> we should have made of our liberty
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have been to have begun cutting each other's

Vergennes, of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of which I do not doubt. How if the

and we have nothing but assignats ; I do not like it at all... "5
Six months after his arrival in Paris, Tone received a
commission in the French army, and with the assistance of the
Directory, General Hoche and others organized the ill fated
Bantry Bay expedition of 1796. Every effort to thwart their
plans was made by the French navy till, as Tone tells us in an
entry dated Nov. 14 to 18, " Villaret de Joyeuse, the Admiral,
is cashiered, and we have got another in his place. Joyeuse
was giving, underhand, all possible impediment to our
expedition. "
His successor, Rear-Admiral Bruix, however, seems to
have shared the indifference of his predecessor in Irish
matters, and the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that it was " always in

by Tone in his diary.
On Dec. 15, the expedition finally started and on the 17th,
in a fog, the Fraternite with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of the Admirals and General
Hoche aboard got separated from the rest of the fleet leaving
Tone and General Grouchy with only about half of the
original expeditionary force at their disposal.
Tone's efforts to effect a landing at Bantry Bay were
frustrated by Grouchy's dilatory tactics and on Dec. 26 we
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the following entry in Tone's Diary : " Last night, at half
after six o'clock, in a heavy gale of wind still from the east, we
were surprised by the Admiral's frigate running under our
quarter, and hailing the Indomptable (Tone's ship) with orders
to cut our cable and put to sea instantly ; the frigate then
pursued her course, leaving us all in the utmost astonishment.
"
Did Wolfe Tone think of Vergennes then ? History fails to
tell us !
The activities of The United Irishmen ended with the
uprising of 1798 and another attempt by the French to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span>

and Wolfe Tone, who was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> prisoner and ordered to be
hanged, cut his throat in his cell.

changed to The Orange Society, and a grand lodge and

Freemasonry (1° York Rite), and the legend was that of the

there were no less than 140,000 Orangemen in England,
40,000 being in London alone. These members were not Irish
Orangemen, but purely English, and they were engaged in a
plot which recalls the best traditions of the Palais Royal and
Philippe-Egalite. The purpose of the plot was to establish the
Duke of Cumberland as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of England, on the plea that
William IV was still insane and the Princess Victoria a
woman and a minor. " 2
" The revolutionary mechanism staged by the Orangemen
was in many ways similar to that of the Orleanist party of
Philippe. Wild rumours were <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> about. Colonel William

he conspired to such end that 381 loyal lodges were
established in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Britain. Another thirty were in the army,
and branches were in many of the colonies.
" The conspiracy prospered from 1828 to 1835, when it
was exposed by Mr. Hume, M. P., and a Committee of
Enquiry in the Commons was granted. As the conspiracy,
however, implicated half the Tory peers, some of the Bishops
and most of the Army, everything passed off quietly;
important witnesses vanished, and the Duke of Cumberland
as Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> decreed the dissolution of the Orange

" The Volunteer movement began in 1914 in Ulster as the
direct consequence of an attempt on the part of the Liberal
Government to force the Home Rule Bill on that province.
This unfortunate measure had passed the Houses despite the
most rigid Unionist opposition,

Ulster, organizing largely through the Orange Lodges,
recruited an Ulster Volunteer Force which was completely

" The Orange Lodges had been reorganized in 1885, when
Gladstone introduced the threatening Home Rule Bill. Prior

THE PHILADELPHIANS
(THE OLYMPIANS)

(Founded 1798)

The Philadelphians, a Royalist Anti-Bonapartist Secret
Society, was founded on masonic lines about 1798 at
Besancon, France, by General Malet and organized by a
Freemason, Lieutenant Colonel Oudet.
Using England as a base of operations, it cooperated for a
while with the " Chouans " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> chief, Pichegru, was
eventually captured and executed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the Directory.
After this event, the Philadelphians adopted the name of
The Olympians. Most of them however, including Oudet,
were shot from ambush the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after the battle of Wagram,
the responsibility for their deaths being placed on Napoleon I.
In 1812 General Malet formed a conspiracy to overthrow
the Empire. Among those implicated were Generals Moreau,
Talleyrand, Trochot, the Comte de Noailles, the Comte de
Montmorency and Fouche, who was then under the cloud of
Napoleon's displeasure. General Massena, Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of
the Grand Orient, who at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was in disgrace, was to

almost succeeded and Fouche says that Malet carried with
him to the grave " the secret of one of the boldest conspiracies
which the Grand Epoch of the Revolution has bequeathed to
history. " 1
General Moreau, who had gone to settle in America
returned to France in 1813, the last of the leaders of the
Olympians. He died Sept. 2 from a wound received some

MODERN KNIGHTS TEMPLAR ENGLAND
(Founded 1804)
In an address by Col. W. J. B. Macleod Moore, of the
Grand Cross of the Temple Royal Arch, Grand Prior of the
Dominion of Canada, printed in The Rosi-crucian and
Masonic Record (page 165), we obtain the following salient
points of English Templar history :
" In 1791, we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> the Templar Rite styled ' Grand Elect
Knights Templar Kadosh, of St. John of Jerusalem, Palestine,
Rhodes, and Malta', <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> combining the modern and more
ancient titles... In 1848 after the Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rite of 33° had been established in England, the
Templar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> resigned control over the Rose Croix and
Kadosh, which had been incorporated into the Ancient and
Accepted Rite as the 18th and 30th degrees. It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
necessary to suppress the old ceremonies and confine
themselves to the Templar alone and to change the name into
the degree of ' Masonic Knights Templar '. This title was not
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in England before 1851, although the term Masonic
appears in the warrants of Admiral Dunkerley

" In 1863 the Grand Conclave again formally revived the
Maltese Order, with a considerable ritual, but as a separate
degree instead of combined with the Templars as it had been
before 1853. "
The following, borrowed from The History of Freemasonry
and Concordant Orders, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> by Stillson and Hughan,

advantage of H.\ R.\ II.-. being at once <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the Craft and
Temple ; indeed, it may be said that as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> was
reformed in 1804-7 by the Duke of Kent, so it was again

Macleod Moore informs us that in 1813 the Craft degrees,
including the.Royal Arch,'were alone recognized as pure and
ancient Freemasonry and that the possession of the Royal
Arch degree in modern times has been, and is now,
considered quite sufficient to preserve the link between the

Heckethorn in his well-known <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Secret Societies of all
Ages and Countries gives the following graphic description
of the foundation of this order.
" We read that several lords of the Court of Louis XIV,
including the Duke de Gramont, the Marquis of Biran, and
Count Tallard, formed a secret society, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> was
pleasure. The <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> increased. Louis XIV, having been
made acquainted with its statutes, banished the members of
the Order, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> denomination was, ' A slight Resurrection
of the Templars. '
" In 1705, Philippe, Duke of Orleans, l collected the
remaining members of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> that had renounced its first
scope to cultivate politics. A Jesuit father, Bonanni, a learned
rogue, fabricated the famous list of supposititious Grand
Masters of the Temple since Molay, beginning with his
immediate successor, Larmenius. No imposture was ever
sustained with greater sagacity. The document offered all the
requisite characteristics of authenticity, and was calculated to
deceive the most

experienced palaeologist. Its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> was to connect the new
institution with the ancient Templars. To render the deception
more perfect, the volume containing the false list was filled
with minutes of deliberations at fictitious meetings under
false dates. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> members were even sent to Lisbon, to obtain
if possible a document of legitimacy from the ' Knights of

and very badly received : one had to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> refuge in England,
the other was transported to Africa, where he died.
" But the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was not discouraged; it grew, and was
probably the same that concealed itself before the outbreak of
the revolution under the vulgar name of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of the

that period the Duke of Cosse-Brissac was Grand Master.
When on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Versailles with other prisoners, there to
undergo their trial, he was massacred, and Ledru, his
physician, obtained possession of the charter of Larmenius
and the MS. statutes of 1705. These documents suggested to
him the idea of reviving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> ; Fabre-Palaprat, a
Freemason, was chosen grand master. Every effort was made
to create a belief in the genuineness of the Order. The brothers
Fabre, Arnal, and Leblond hunted up relics. The shops of
antiquaries supplied the sword, mitre, and helmet of Molay,
and the faithful were shown his bones, withdrawn from the
funeral pyre on which he has been burned. " 2
This presumably is the particular Templar sect that

In 1814, Fabre-Palaprat found a Greek manuscript of the

RITE OF MIZRAIM
(Founded 1805)

This rite had 90 degrees. It was founded in 1805 at Milan
by Le Changeur, Gavel, Marc Bedarride and Joly, and was
introduced into France in 1816.
Its trials of initiation were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and difficult, and founded
on what is recorded of the Egyptian and Eleusinian mysteries.
Heckethorn states that this rite is essentially autocratic
there being no obligation on the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for
his actions.
In the Rosicrucian for January 1871 we read the following
notice (page 136).
" We have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pleasure in announcing that this
philosophic Masonic Rite (Ancient and Primitive Rite of
Mizraim) has been recently established in England under
authority derived from the Grand Council of Rites for France,
and that the Conservators General held a meeting at
Freemasons Tavern, on Wednesday, the 28th December. The
principal chairs were filled by 111. Bros. Wentworth Little
90° ; the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Limerick 90°; and S. Rosenthal
90°; by whom the ' Bective ' Sanctuary of Levites — the 33rd
of the Rite — was duly opened...

It was then anounced that the following brethren had
accepted office in the Rite : The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Bective,
Sovereign Grand Master, etc., etc. "
The Rite of Mizraim was amalgamated with that of
Memphis in 1775, when John Yarker, as stated by Freke
Gould 1 " sanctioned the communication of the degrees of
Mizraim to members of the Rite of Memphis, the former
having no separate governing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in this country "
(England).
" According to an official statement, repeated in every
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the Kneph : " France (having) abandoned the Rite,
and the 111. Gd. Hierophant, J. E. Marconis, 33°, 97°, having

Accepted Rite, executed a tripartite Treaty to render mutual
aid, and restored the Sov. Gd. Mystic Temple — Imp.
Council Cen., 96°, presided over by a Gd. Hierophant, 97°, in
1775. "
Essentially Jewish, the historical activities of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to

Mizraim in Paris, in 1884, by Joseph Schorst, later murdered

the document with the result that it was soon published
everywhere.
In England, it was and still is published by an organization
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> " The Britons ".
In Germany, a remarkable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> was done by Gottfried
zum Beck.
In France, it was published by Mgr. Jouin of the Revue
Internationale des Societes Secretes and by the fearless M.
Urbain Gohier of Vieille France.
In the United States, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> anonymous editions were
published, one by Small Maynard of Boston, and the other,
later, by the Beckwith Company.
Then editions appeared in Italian, Russian, Arabic and
even Japanese.
No sooner had the document been made public than loud
protests were <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> coming from all sections of dispersed
Israel. Writers and lecturers were recruited to deny the
assertion and shatter the growing belief of a Jewish
conspiracy for the political, economic and legislative
dominion of the world.
The method of intimidation <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to suppress discussion of
The Protocols has always been the same. It

410

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

consists in suggesting that the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> guilty of interest in the
subject is crazy or becoming so. As the average mortal prefers
to be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> sane by his fellow men, the trick generally
works.
A short review of the affray must be made. First and
foremost came a strong denial made by a Jew, Lucien Wolf,
who wrote the pamphlet : The Jewish Bogey and the Forged
Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, (1920). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Israel</span>
Zangwill, another Jew, also wrote against the veracity of the
Protocols. Then, in America, followed articles by William
Hard, in the Metropolitan, ridiculing belief in the document.
More serious was the painstaking campaign undertaken
against the publication of the Protocols by the chiefs of the U.
S. Kahal or Kehillah, who intimidated the editor, George H.
Putnam, and. forced him to stop the publication of the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> by
threats to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> his loans and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> ruin him financially. The
Beckwith Co. was eventually induced by the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League to enclose in every copy of the
edition they published a small pamphlet containing the denial
of the contents of the Protocols.
Among the Gentiles found ready to deny the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of the
Protocols was a certain du Chayla, also a Mrs. Hurl-but and
the notorious Princess Catherine Radziwill who had
previously reached the pinnacle of self-advertisement by
having had herself sentenced to a term of imprisonment in
South Africa for forgery in 1902. It seemed as if all the denials
against the Jewish authorship of the Protocols had been made,
when finally in 1921 the London Times made the sensational
discovery through one of its correspondents in Constantinople,
a Mr. X. — of a French <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Dialogues
of Geneva, published anonymously at Brussels in 1865. It was
this book, the Times affirmed, which

RITE

had been plagiarized by the author of the Protocols.
The publication of this discovery by the Times seemed to
have closed all further discussion tending to prove the Jewish
authenticity of the Protocols and very little has been <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
since on the subject.
Yet, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Zionist, Max Nordau, during

Maurice Joly (1831-1878), was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at Lons-le-Saul-nier.
His mother, nee Florentine Corbara Courtois, was a Corsican
of Italian origin and a Roman Catholic. Her father, Laurent
Courtois, had been paymaster-general of Corsica. He had an
inveterate hatred of Napoleon I.
Joly's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> was Philipe Lambert Joly, <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> at Dieppe,

in 1849 he <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> for Paris.

412

OCCULT THEOCRASY

There, thanks to his maternal grandfather's masonic
associations, he secured, just before the Coup d'Etat in 1851,
a post in the Ministry of the Interior under M. Chevreau. In
1860 only, he terminated his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> studies, — he wrote several
articles, showed a certain amount of talent and ended by
founding a paper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Le Palais for lawyers and attorneys.
The principal stockholders were Jules Favre, Desmaret,
Leblond, Adolphe Cremieux, Arago, and Berryer.
Joly was a Socialist. He wrote of himself: " Socialism
seems to me one of the forms of a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for the peoples
emancipated from the traditions of the Old World. I accept a

Communism either as a social factor or as a political
institution. Communism is but a school of Socialism. In
politics I understand extreme means to gain one's ends — in
that, at least, I am a Jacobin. "
Friend of Adolphe Cremieux, he shared in his hatred of
Napoleon III. He hated absolutism as much as he hated
Communism and as, under the influence of his Prime
Minister Rouher, the French Emperor led a policy of reaction,
Maurice Joly qualified it as Machia-velian and depicted it as
such in his pamphlet.
In one of his books he wrote of it :
" Machiavelli represents the policy of Might compared to
Montesquieu's, which represents the policy of Right —
Machiavelli will be Napoleon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> who will himself depict his

(From Maurice Joly — <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> passe, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span>

And here comes the important point which the Times
omitted to put before its readers when it made the sensational
discovery about the Dialogues of Geneva in 1921!
Maurice Joly, who hated Communism and, in 1864,
ascribed the Machiavelian policy of Might over Right

RITE

to the Imperialism of Napoleon III, was evidently ignorant of
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that he himself was no innovator, for, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before he
ever entered the journalistic or political world, the very theory
which he had tried to expose and refute had been the guiding

of the 1848 revolution.

In 1848, after the February Revolution, Venedy returned to
Germany, still in the company of Karl Marx. He soon
afterwards became one of the chiefs of the revolutionary
Committee of Fifty, organized at Frankfort-on-Main in March
1848. Venedy was sent as " Commissar " into the Oberland to
stand against Ecker. In Hesse-Homburg he was elected a

Following the apparent contradiction between Jacob
Venedy and Maurice Joly, one showing the Machiavelli and
Rousseau policy as that of triumphant Communism, whilst
the other makes it the policy of Reaction and Imperialism, one
is apt to overlook the link between the two. The student of the
1830-1848 period of history is here confronted by a
remarkable fact.

Montefiore, Disraeli, the Goldsmids, were not less Jews than
Karl Marx, <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Hess, Jacoby, Lassalle, Venedy, Riesser.
The Liberal Conservatism of Disraeli, the reactionary
Imperialism of Fould and the revolutionary Communism of
Karl Marx all point towards the same aim, namely, the
establishment of Jewish power, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> under a
Constitutional Monarchy, an Empire, or a Republic. And
although their respective activities seem to stand so far apart,

of the most striking instances is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Adolphe Cremieux
who played a prominent part in the period we are now
concerned with, and who was connected with all parties and
actually helped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the centre which united them all, viz. The

Jewish contemporaries, belonging to widely divergent social
spheres, illustrate forcibly the concerted plan of Judaism to
reach its secret Messianic hope of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> domination.
Until about 1848, it seemed somewhat difficult to show
conclusively the link between Judaism and Illuminism,
Communism and Capitalism, but a close study of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of

Whereas in Gentile life, there is an unbridgeable abyss
between Conservatism and Anarchy, Religion and Atheism,
there is no such chasm in the Jewish mentality. There, all
currents, no <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in what direction they may seem to flow,
are finally united and channelled in one unique direction.
If it has been somewhat difficult for historians of

416

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the French Revolution to see the close link between Judaism and
Illuminism, we repeat that no such difficulty exists for the student
of the 1848 revolutionary period, after he has followed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
Adolphe Cre-mieux and the activities of his Jewish contemporaries.
The main difference is that the term " Illuminism " <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the 18th
century is replaced by the wide term Freemasonry which embraces
all the existent secret societies.
Adolphe Isaac Cremieux (1796-1880) came from a Jewish family
of the South of France, that had members in Aix, Nimes and
Marseilles. 4
In his youth, Cremieux was an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon
I ; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in 1831, he pronounces the funeral eulogy of the ill famed
revolutionist of 1789, the Abbe Gregoire. He chose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> as his
profession and was admitted to the Bar at Nimes in 1817.
Briefly, Cremieux's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> may be viewed from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sides : 1st, his
racial Jewish activities, 2nd, his Masonic activities, 3rd, his
political influence.
Cremieux's racial Jewish activities are exemplified by the part he
<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> in the Damascus Affair with <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Montefiore, a Jew of

sufficient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to feel enabled to show to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
that although the civil rights they enjoyed had been granted
them by different countries, the real allegiance of each and
every one of them was due to their Jewish nationality.
The Masonic activities of Adolphe Cremieux were many
and powerful. His connection with Louis Bonaparte and his
brother, who both were affiliated to the Carbonari, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
suggest that he was also connected with this secret society.
But it is a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that Cremieux belonged to the Lodge of
Mizraim, the Scottish Rite, and also the Grand Orient. He was
in the Supreme Council of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Mizraim and, at the

Scottish Rite had been united, Cremieux succeeded him as
Grand Master.
The political activities of Cremieux are also manifold and
varied. In his youth, he had been an admirer of Napoleon I and
later became an intimate friend as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the legal adviser of
the Bonaparte family and joined their party which was
undermining the government of Louis Philippe, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of
Philippe " Egalite "
In 1848, he was one of the most ardent supporters of Louis
Napoleon and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an active part in the overthrow of Louis
Philippe. He had been one of the foremost speakers in the
association known as the Campagne des Banquets which had
done so much to promote the Revolution of Feb. 1848.
He became a member of the provisional government and
was appointed Minister of Justice. He strongly advocated the
candidature of his friend, Louis Napoleon, for the post of
President of the French Republic. Cremieux had had hopes of
being made Chief Executive under Louis Napoleon and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

same role which Disraeli played in England, that is ruling the
country from behind the scenes. Both Disraeli and Cremieux
had the same financial backing, namely the wealth of the
Rothschilds and Montefiores who, in London, were friends of
Disraeli and, in Paris, friends of Cremieux. Cremieux was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> keenly disappointed when General Cavaignac was
appointed Prime Minister in the Republican Government of
Louis Napoleon, and as a revenge, he directed his activities
against the Prince President, his former friend. He became so
hostile to him, that in 1851, after the Coup d'Etat of December
2, by which Louis Napoleon recreated the Empire and
assumed the title of Napoleon III, Cremieux was imprisoned
at Vincennes and Mazas. After his release, he made himself
the champion and defender of the Communist associates of
Karl Marx, the revolutionaries Louis Blanc, Ledru Rollin,
Pierre Leroux and others.
His untiring efforts were directed against the Empire in
general and Napoleon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> in particular, and he consorted with
all the Emperor's enemies, among them, Maurice Joly, the
author of the Dialogue between Machia-velli and

defeat of France at the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of Germany in 1871, and the
establishment of the Republic, Cremieux once more <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an
open part in the political affairs of the country.
He pushed to the front his former secretary Gam-betta and
effectively directed him in his shady negotiations with
Bismarck, the latter himself being guided by the Jew
Bamberger (1852-1899), a former revolutionist of 1848, but
who, having found refuge in France, had been for many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

the ties linking the Jews united in the Alliance Israelite
Universelle.
From 1871 until his death, it can be safely asserted that
Cremieux as President of the Alliance Israelite Universelle
and Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of the Scottish Rile. exercised a tremendous

the Franco-Prussian War. In this as in all his lifelong activities,
Cremieux was only obeying the teachings of the Talmud and
trying to destroy every religion but that contained in Judaism.
His favourite theme was that there should be only one cult —
and that cult should be Jewish. At a general assembly of the
Alliance Israelite Universelle, on May 31 1864, Cremieux
had said : " The Alliance is not limited to our cult, it voices its
appeal to all cults and wants to penetrate in all the religions as
it has penetrated into all countries. Let us endeavour boldly to
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the union of all cults under one flag of Union and

RITE (ANCIENT AND

ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE)

(Founded 1808)
The following article is quoted in part from an article specifically
<span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by Josiah H. Drummond 33° in The History Of Freemasonry
and Concordant Orders by Stillson and Hughan : l
" In 1806 Joseph Cerneau appeared in New York; he had been a
member of Masonic bodies in the West Indies ; he had a patent from
Mathieu Dupotet certifying that he had received the degrees of the
Scottish Rite of Heredom, and authorizing him to confer the degrees
up to the Twenty-fourth and organize bodies in the northern part of
Cuba, and to confer the Twenty-fifth on one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in each year, the
Twenty-fifth being then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree of the Rite and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Cerneau had received, according to his patent. Cerneau had
his patent from Dupotet, who had his from Germain Hacquet, who
had his from Du Plessis, who had his from Prevost in 1790, who had
his from Francken. "2

In 1808 he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a grand consistory of the Rite of
Heredom having jurisdiction over 25 degrees.
" But already a controversy had arisen with parties acting
under, or deriving their powers from, the Supreme Council at
Charleston. We may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> believe that Cerneau and his
associates soon recognized the impossibility of maintaining
successfully a rite of twenty-five degrees against one of
thirty-three degrees... The Thirty-third degree as now existing
originated at Charleston in 1801 ; and no evidence has been
found that Cerneau ever received it. "
Cerneau seems however to have overlooked the obvious
expedient of creating a 34th degree !
" The Charleston <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> did not recognize the Cerneau
Bodies even by silent acquiescence ; after investigation by a
special Deputy, it declared, early in 1814, Cerneau to be an
impostor, and his organizations illegal and clearly clandestine.
"
" Bitter controversies followed. " Lodges which soon died
were opened at Charleston. Others at New Orleans eked out a
precarious <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> under James Foulhouze. " Foulhouze
had received the Thirty-third degree from the Grand Orient of
France, which expelled him, Feb. 4, 1859, for a scurrilous
publication which he issued in answer to one of its decrees.
This Supreme Council became dormant; but, in 1867, it was
revived with Eugene Chassaignac at its <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> ; in 1868 it was
recognized by the Grand Orient of France, and unless it has
recently gone out of existence, the Grand-Orient to-day
recognizes a so-called Supreme Council in New Orleans as a
lawful body, and its members as possessing the Thirty-third
degree ! "
In 1826 the Morgan murder occurred and Cerneau <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> for
France. De Witt Clinton, Governor of New York, had been

Grand Commander.
A <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of sporadic revivals of this rite occurred during
the ensuing 40 years.
They were known as —
The Hicks Rite, founded in 1832 by Comte de St. Laurent.
The First Atwood Body, founded about 1837 by Henry C.
Atwood.
The Cross Body, founded about 1851 by Jeremy L. Cross.
The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Atwood Body, founded about 1853.
It was not till 1867 that <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> was established between the

United States. On that date they united and Josiah H.
Drummond was elected Grand Commander.

since but little has been <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of that Supreme Council,
although it probably still exists. "
" In 1881, Hopkins Thompson, an Emeritus member of the
Supreme Council, assisted by a few Honorary members and
by a Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret, who is believed by
many to have been the mainspring of the movement, all of
whom had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the oath of fealty to the Supreme Council,
formed an association, which they are pleased to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the

but not till the year 1815 did we begin to hear of its individual
historical achievements.
The following is a translation of one of the secret official
documents published in Italy by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> authority of the
order, for the guidance of the active head-centres of Masonry

to Nubio, one of the Supreme Vendita (Alta Vendita) in 1824,
when he was sent to Rome to carry it into effect, and it was to
this instruction that he referred when he wrote from Forli to
Signor Volpi : " As I have <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> to you before, I am

the past century, who had preceded, made, planned, and
passed through the French Revolution of 1789. They were
rife with the republican notions of France and Italy. They had
survived their works, and had been in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> measure

brought, as it were, in presence of a new world, they <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
breath and courage, and gathering up the broken threads of
the tangled skein, determined to spend the rest of their lives in
restoring, if possible, the web commenced in 1789 and 1783.
The principal author was supposed to be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of the name of

Robespierre, and an enemy of Napoleon, against whom he
always conspired. He was a centre in Paris for both French
and Italian Carbonari. He had been one of the principals in

summary, expressed in the clearest terms, of the aim of
Freemasonry and the means by which it is attained ;
Freemasonry antecedent to the French Revolution;
Freemasonry during the French Revolution ; Freemasonry
revived after the Restoration. Freemasonry, to-day, is one and

of anxieties, which agitate the most vigorous spirits of'our
society, one there is that can never be forgotten. The Papacy
ever exercises a decisive influence over the lot of Italy. With
the arm, the voice, the pen, of its innumerable bishops, monks,
nuns, and faithful of all latitudes, the Pope finds everywhere
persons enthusiastically prepared for sacrifice, and even for
martyrdom, friends who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> die for him, or <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> all for

partially. The question of to-day is not the reconstruction of a
momentarily weakened power.
" Our final aim is that of Voltaire and of the French
Revolution, — the complete annihilation of Catholicism, and
ultimately of Christianity. Were Christianity to survive, even

again by a contemptible sarcasm. Catholicism has a vitality
which survives such attacks with ease. She has seen

The Pope, whoever he may be, will never enter into a secret

the storming of the Church than with all the little books of

The <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> ruling grades of the Carbonari appear to have
been those of Sublime Maitre Parfait, above which was still
another that of the Sublime Elus. 5
The Alta Vendita constituted the Supreme Directory of the

amongst whom a prince, " the profoundest of initiates, was

Carbonari.
" The Chiefs of the Carbonari were also chiefs among the
Guelphs ; but only those that had distinct offices among the
Carbonari could be admitted among the Guelphs. There can
be no doubt that the Carbonari when the sect had become very
numerous, partly sheltered themselves under the designation
of Guelphs and Adelphi or Independents, by affiliating
themselves to these societies. " 7

THE

HETAIRIA

LXVII
OF

GREECE

(ETHERISTS)

(Founded 1814)

Hetairia was the Greek name for societies, organizations or
associations. In ancient Greece the name hetairia applied to
companies in the army. In more modern times, it was <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for
societies of learning, or commercial purposes and also for
political secret societies.
It is in connection with the latter that we are concerned.
While Greece was under Turkish dominion, the national
aspirations of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> could be vented in secret only. The
breath of revolution which swept Europe during the latter part
of the 18th century stirred some of the Greek patriots <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
aims was the overthrow of the Turkish power. The main
leader at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was Constantin Rhygas (1754-1798).
He formed the first secret societies of Hetairias which
were mainly composed of Klephtes or bandits. Bound by oath,
each member of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> all means,
assassination included, to <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> Greece. The execution of
Rhygas drove the hetairias to seek cover but in 1814, a chief
lodge was re-formed in Odessa under the name of Hetairia
phileke. Its avowed aim was
438

the liberation of Greece, and its main seat was in Russia.
Every candidate <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an oath, as in all secret societies, and
knew no one beyond his initiator and sponsor. Funds,
collected and administered by a superior council directing all
the lodges, were kept in Russia.
When a sufficient <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of Hetairias were organized and
a chief needed to direct the movement against Turkey, Count
Capo d'lstria, (John, 1776-1831) a Greek, minister in Russia
under the Tzar Alexander I, and author of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span>
Alliance was asked to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the lead but refused, and
Alexander Ypsilanti was nominated. The insurrection broke
out in 1821.
Among the most prominent members of the Hetairia we
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> Alexander Mavrocordato (1791-1865) who was under
the influence of England and was also the friend of Byron
whom he had met in Missolonghi in 1822. From him he
received funds for the purchase of arms to the extent of one
hundred <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> francs. It is related that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Byron died in
his arms at Missolonghi in 1824. Among the supporters of the
London Branch of the Philhellenic Committee were Jeremy
Bentham, Sir Francis Burdett, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Erskine, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Ebrington,

There were five grades namely : —
The Adelphoi (Brothers, who <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> an oath of secrecy but
ignored the aims of the society),
The Systemenoi (Bachelors, who knew that Greece was to
be freed by revolution),
The Priests of Eleusis,
The Prelates (knowing all the secrets),
The Grand Arch (The supreme directing control of 12
members).
" Early in 1827 a motion was unanimously adopted by the
Senate favouring the placing of Greece under the protection
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Britain. " This followed a secret interview of
Mavrocordato with Sir Stratford Canning, but Mavrocordato
retired from public <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> " on the failure of his project for the
establishment of a constitutional kingdom under British
protection."
" Hostilities in Greece were finally terminated, in the
summer of 1828, by a convention concluded at Alexandria
between Admiral Codrington and Mehemet Ali, by which the
latter agreed to withdraw the Egyptian troops from the Morea.

The arbitrary government of Capo d'lstria ended on
October 24, 1831, when he was assassinated.

the Hung and the White Lotus, the latter a Taoist mystical

Manchus. This is known as the Taiping Revolt and is often

CARBONARISM

(Founded 1820)
The Masonic Lodge Les Amis de la Verite was founded in
1820 by Buchez, Flotard, Bazard and Jou-bert, all
Freemasons, for political purposes. On a riot incited by
members of this lodge a young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was killed. As a
consequence of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> this lodge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> out of existence.
One of its former members, Dugied, a Freemason, was
initiated into the mysteries of Carbonarism while at Naples. 1
Having conceived the project of introducing this association
into France he discussed the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> with another ex-member
of the Ami's de la Verite, Flotard, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> they decided
to put the idea into practice by taking as a nucleus of the new
organization the remains of Les Amis de la Verite.
The <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was organized as follows :—
The one " Haute Vente ", central " Ventes " and individual
" Ventes " (lodges).
The "Haute Vente" was the committee of direction and
action. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> members of the committee having found an

what had been made above them, forming an individual "

indefinitely the ramifications of the sect.
A similar organization, but under different names, was
adapted to the army. There the Haute Vente was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
Legion, the central Ventes, the Cohortes, the individual
Ventes of the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> the Centuries ; and the ordinary
individual Ventes the Manipules.
This double system was intended to puzzle the police, by
making it believe that there was a separate association in the
army. A further measure of precaution forbade a Carbonaro,
under penalty of death, being affiliated to another Vente. This
precaution was intended to prevent anyone entering different
groups and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> possibly discovering and denouncing the
seerets of the society.
The direction of the Ventes was indeed centralized but this
unity of control was to be ignored by most of the members.
The Carbonari had no settled principles. It accepted all
opinions provided these favoured the elimination of royal
families. The imperialists and liberals formed important
nuclei. The latter, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of middle-class

parents, stirred against the government by patriotism, youth
and class jealousy, dreamed only of grabbing the influence of
the old families. As for what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the people, it did not
count in Carbonarism ; the illustrious role attributed to it later
had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> been invented !
To begin with, the Haute Yente counted only seven
members : Dugied, Flotard, Bazard, Buchez, Joubert, Carriol,
Limperani. Among them we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> again the four heads of the
Amis de la Verite.
The Carbonari having prospered, the Haute Vente found it
advisable to annex some notable characters. Among others,
the Freemason General Lafayette, who, even in old age, had a
childish weakness for popularity, accepted the offer to join
the conspiracy.
Towards the end of 1820 the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> had many branches,
notably those of Bordeaux, Nantes, Toulouse, La Bochelle,
Poitiers, Colmar, Belfort, etc.
The subversive efforts of this <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> culminated in an
abortive attempt at Bevolution at La Bochelle, and the
subsequent arrest of many of its principal members
completed its nominal dissolution.
After the debacle at La Rochelle the Amis de la Verite
merged into the Amis du Peuple which in turn, in 1832,
became the Droits de I'Homme. After its unsuccessful
attempt to assassinate the king, (Louis Philippe) in 1835 the
remains of the Droits de I'Homme reorganized as the Societe
des Families with Blanqui and Barbes as leaders. According
to Lucien de la Hodde,2 Carbonarism in France had ceased to
exist by 1822, except for a few obstinates like Charles Teste,
(a friend of Babeuf) and Buonarotti who remained

France through Ledru Rollin and Felix Pyat. After its collapse
in 1836 the Societe des Families became that of the Saisons

aiding in the terrorisation of Paris and the fall of the
Monarchy.

Brahmaism, was founded by Rajah Ram Mohun Roy
(1774-1833), in 1830.
Its main <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> was to fight idolatrous rites and practices,
and, by many, it has been described as a " Hindu Unitarian
Church. "
The chief achievement of Ram Mohun Roy was the
abolition by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> William Bentinck of the practice of " suttee

Owing to his efforts, the institution became purely Theistic,
giving up the authority of the Yedas and eliminating the
Vedantic element from the Brahmic covenant. In 1856,
Debendra Nath Tagore had also gone to the Himalayas where
he spent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> as a disciple of the Tibetan Lamas. Later,
he was joined in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> by his friend Keshub Chunder Sen
who, however, in 1863, devoured by the ambition of
becoming sole leader, attacked the Somaj, heading what one
might <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the revolt of the " Young Brah-maists " and with
his followers seceded from the Mother organization.
The schism gave rise to the formation of another Somaj
which was directed by Keshub Chunder Sen under the name
Somaj of India, whereas the former organization, remaining
under the leadership of Debendra Nath Tagore, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Adi Samaj or Original Church. It was also named "
Conservative ", in opposition to the new institution termed "
Progressive ".
Keshub Chunder Sen retained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in his organization ;
the foundation stone of the Somaj of India Church was laid at
Jhamapukur in Calcutta, in 1868. In 1870 he journeyed to
England where he was enthusiastically received by the
spiritualist centres of the day, and succeeded in exciting much
interest in the political, social and religious affairs of India. In
1878, his disregard for the rules of the Somaj regarding
Hindu marriages which he infringed in the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of the
wedding of his own daughter to the young Maharajah of
Kuch Behar, caused another split in the ranks of the Somaj of
India. The dissidents then formed the Sadharan Brahmo
Somaj.
The career of Keshub Chunder Sen must be followed with
interest by students of Theosophy. Therein will they <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span>
many of the odd principles and injunctions

BRAHMO

laid down by H. P. Blavatsky and Annie Besant. For instance,
the theocratic system was that promoted by Keshub Chunder
Sen in his efforts to found a universal religion which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
unite all creeds and symbols ; the Christian Cross, the
Crescent, the Vedic Om, the Saiva's trident and the
Vaishnava's Khunti. By means of imaginary pilgrimages, he
led his adherents successively to the shrines of Moses,
Buddha, to the Himalayan heights and Lama teachers, to
<span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> and to Mahomet.
Similarly to Annie Besant's Khrishnamurti, he allowed
himself to be worshipped as the Saviour of Sinners ; his
theory was the reincarnation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of which he was
one. Further, he complacently allowed his followers to raise
him to the dignity of a deity. As the Kheshub Chunder Sen's
worship increased, there grew also the dogma of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Injunction. A salient feature of Keshub's teaching was the
belief or blind <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in the revelations claimed to have been
made to invisible teachers and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> guides and exaction
of blind obedience to their commands. We are forcibly
reminded of the claim made by H. P. Blavatsky to her
followers to sign their blind acceptance of all orders
presumably received from invisible masters like her Koot
Hoomi.
Another feature which, later, distinguished Keshub
Chunder Sen's devotees was the " Bhakti " <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of their
religion. Unlike " Yoga ", the old Hindu type of religious
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> or contemplation, " Bhakti ", which has been
chiefly developed by the followers of Chay-tania in India, is a
manifestation of religious frenzy. It spurns the aspiration to
approach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> by concentration of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as silent communion, which they deem unprofitable and vain.
The philosophy of " Bhakti " is that the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> must

induces dancing, sobbing, swooning. The more frenzied the
manifestations, the greater the religious perfection. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Bhakta is one who, like the founder of the school, shows the
greatest religious madness.

initiates was 11. The ceremony of initiation was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> New

In 1880, Keshub Chunder Sen had given his organization
another name, that of " The New Dispensation ".
It is in the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia that one must
seek the amalgamation of Jewish Cabala magic and Hindu
magic. The latter swept over Europe with the spread of
Theosophy and flourished particularly in England. There it
had found a ground in 1830 with the teachings given by Ram
Mohun Roy to the spiritualists of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with whom he had

THE MORMONS
(Founded 1830)

Soon after the establishment of Mormonism its founder,
Joseph Smith, conceived the idea of establishing a Masonic
super rite.
In M. R. Werner's <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Brigham Young (page 62) the
following remark makes this evident.
" Masonry was always popular with the Mormons until
Joseph Smith claimed that an angel of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> had <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
him the lost key-words of several degrees, enabling him to
progress further than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Masons. The charter of the
Mormon lodge was then <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> away by the Grand Lodge ".
Joseph Smith, applying his powers of mediumship towards
the realization of the ambitious project nurtured by General
Pepe, Mazzini and others for the establishment of a super rite,
was not necessarily acceptable to the Masonic leaders of his
time.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> as a Mason he failed but as the founder of a Masonic
sect he succeeded.
So much has already been <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> about the sect of the
Mormons that we confine ourselves here to a short sketch of
opinion and descriptions given by various authors. The
following is extracted from The Encyclopaedia Britannica,

his alleged visions, in one of which on the night of 21st Sept.,

him that the Bible of the Western Continent, the supplement

covered with small writing in the ' reformed Egyptian ' tongue,
and were accompanied by a pair of supernatural spectacles,
consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> crystals <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in a silver bow, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ' Urim

be read. Being himself unable to read or write fluently, Smith
employed as amanuensis one Oliver Cowdery, to whom from
behind a curtain, he dictated a translation, which, with the aid
of a farmer, Martin Harris, 1 who had more money than wit,
was printed and published in 1830 under the title of The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span>

panied by the sworn statement of Oliver Cowdery, <span class="t6 t11 t13 t14 t15 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">David</span>
Whitmer, and Martin Harris, that an angel of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had shown

later, denounced as false ; but meanwhile it helped Smith to
impose on the credulous, particularly in the absence of the
gold plates themselves which suddenly and mysteriously
disappeared. "
Blanchard draws a parallel between this story of the gold
plates and that of the legend of the 14th degree of Scottish
Rites Masonry, that of Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime
Mason, according to which " the real name oi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> was lost,
till it was found by Masons, engraved on a three-cornered
gold plate, in " the ruins of Enoch. "2
In reality, this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> " was <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in 1812 as an historical
romance by one Solomon Spalding, a crack-brained preacher;
and the MS. falling into the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of an unscrupulous
compositor, Sidney Rigdon, was copied by him, and
subsequently given to Joseph Smith. Armed with this <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>

to attract followers. " 3
Joseph Smith was a Mason.
The Gold Plate trick, having worked so successfully once,
was tried again in 1843 when six plates were found by Robert
Wiley, a merchant of Kinderhook, Illinois. " The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> story of

Mystery of Mormonism (page 69), in an affidavit made by W.
Fulgate, of Mount Station, Brown County, 111. on June 30th,
1879, when he swore before J. Brown, Justice of the Peace,
that the " plates were humbug, gotten up by Robert

then conducted to the temple, ushered into a private room, and
commanded to undress for the inspection of the presiding

neophytes in the linen robes or garments of endowment and
conducts them into a large room which is divided by white

Young then appears, and drives them out of the garden with a

MODERN SPIRITISM
(Founded 1848)

Modern Spiritism, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Spiritualism, traces its
descent from the mystifications of Catherine and Margaret
Fox, the daughters of John Fox, who, in 1848, during the
course of experiments conducted in a haunted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> at
Hydesville, New York, U. S. A. elaborated a system of
communication by raps, with invisible entities. Both sisters
eventually confessed to having abused the credulity of the
public in their spiritist seances but the universal interest
aroused by the phenomena at Hydesville did not abate.
Since then, there has been a regular epidemic of table
turning, ouija boards, planchettes, automatic writings and
similar modes, more or less effective, for achieving
mediumship.
The acquisition of this type of mediumship exposes the
aspirant to the danger of an induced <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of mental passivity
during which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> may register vibrations broadcast
from some terrestrial centre such as that provided by the
recently constituted " Polaire <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> " and recognized by the
H. B. of L. (See page 531).
The cultivation of spiritism under all its different aspects
either for amusement or pseudo-scientific inves473

practices are indulged in for an appreciable length of time,

hours. This sensation is shortly followed by serious <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
weakness, manifest in sports-and athletics. Presently, the

to sleep at night.

Mediumship does not imply power. A medium is a
receiver and, as such, furthers the will of another. The fakirs

The distance between the windows was about seven feet six

nor was there more than a twelve inch projection to each

What are we to think when we read in John Drink-water's

Dashwood was Chancellor of the Exchequer under G?orge

Regarding the career of Sir Francis, we here read the
following. The comment concerns John Wilkes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> "

election. His resentment against that nobleman and Sir
Francis Dashwood, the founder of the Society, was not
appeased by the success of an exploit that diverted the town.
Wilkes contrived to let a baboon loose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> one of the

hysterics at the apparition of what their befuddled wits <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>
to be the devil. " 1
What indeed can be deduced from such an historical <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
as that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Sandwich, " notable even in that age as a

Merely mentioning that the plaintiff won his

THE FENIANS.

(Founded 1857-1858)
Concerning this famous Secret Society, Captain Pollard
writes :
" From its earliest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> to the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the I. R. B. has
existed as a militant revolutionary secret society, with the
avowed <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of separating Ireland from all connection with
the British Empire and establishing an independent
Republican Government. l
" The founders of this movement were Colonel John
O'Mahoney and a barrister, Michael Doheney, both of whom
had fled from Ireland for their share in the rising of 1848.
Both these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> refuge in France, at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a hot-bed

that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> fugitives lived with James Stephens, the real
<span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and organizer of the Fenian movement, who was also a
refugee. "
" In 1857 a messenger was sent from New York to James
Stephens, then in Dublin, asking him to get

up an organization in Ireland on resources provided from the
States (U. S. A.) ; and it is clear that Stephens had already
cut-and-dried plans in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as to how this was to be done.
He stated his terms, which were agreed to, and on St. Patrick's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> 1858, the I. R. B. movement was initiated by Stephens
and Luby in Dublin. "
In 1859 the I. R. B. exacted the following oath ; " I, A. B.,
in the presence of Almighty God, do solemnly swear
allegiance to the Irish Republic now virtually established ;
and that I will do my utmost, at every risk, while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> lasts, to
defend its independence and integrity ; and finally that I will
yield implicit obedience in all things, not contrary to the laws
of God, to the commands of my superior officers. So help me
God. Amen. "
" The organization made rapid headway, but the weight of
the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was surging against the
movement, and in due course the Brotherhood was
excommunicated ; in 1861 no Fenian could get absolution. "
In reference to the founding of the Fenian <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> in
America, Heckethorn fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> the
following :
" In Nov. 1863, the Fenian organization assumed a new
character. A grand national convention of delegates met at
Chicago and avowed the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the Brotherhood, namely,
the separation of Ireland from England, and the establishment
of an Irish republic, the same changes being first to be
effected in Canada. Another grand convention was held in
1864 at Cincinnati, the delegates at which represented some
250,000 members, each of which members was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

promptly responded to.... About the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a Fenian
Sisterhood was established, and the

associating they returned upwards of £200,000 sterling to the
Fenian Exchequer for the purpose of purchasing arms and
other war material. " 2
To raise money the Fenians issued bonds redeemable 90

Availing ourselves of the remarkable documentation
furnished by Captain Pollard we gather the following facts :
" The American Fenian Brotherhood was a separate
organization, distinct from the Irish Fenian Brotherhood or I.
R. B. having its own leaders ; but both organizations were on
the same lines and had their officers, both civil and military
oaths, emblems, and passwords, funds and stores of arms. " 3
All was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> till Sept. 14, 1865 when "the Dublin
authorities, who were thoroughly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> informed, raided the

James Stephens was arrested with the rest but " escaped
through the nominal complicity of a warder, John Breslin,
who was also a member of the I. R. B. "
" Stephens had received some twenty-five <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
pounds, little of which was spent in Ireland, and in later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

" In 1869 new influences in America and Paris succeeded
in reforming the I. R. B. Directorate in London, a nd the
organization became not only a mainspring of revolutionary
endeavour in Ireland, but a definite element in the complex
machinery of world-revolution. "
In March 1865, the Fenians joined the amalgamation of
subversive Secret Societies under Karl Marx, known as the
International Association of Working Men, founded in
London on September 28th.
" It is, at all events, clear that Marx and the leaders of the I.
R. B. were in close touch, and that Marx knew, even if the
mass of Irish dupes did not, that the Irish revolutionary dream
of the I. R. B. and Fenian leaders was no merely nationalist
rebellion, but was to be a social revolution.5
" The function of the Fenian ' General ' Cluseret and his
relation to the International are not precisely clear, but he
appears to have acted as a chief of the military rather than the
civil <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the secret Lodges. During his stay in England on
his Fenian mission he paid particular attention to the problem
of how London might be captured, held and burnt.... After the
suppression of the Paris branch of the Internationale it was
Cluseret who organized the workers as a secret communist
revolutionary society. "
The more recent activities of the I. R. B. should be
followed in connection with The Clan-na-Gael.

In our enumeration of subversive societies we must

Pollard writes the following in The Secret Societies of
Ireland (page 46).
" In 1858 a premature organization, contrived to revive the

It was founded in 1860 by Aristide Astruc, Isidor Cahen,

Cremieux was president from 1863-1867 and again from

Israelite Universelle was Hirsch Kalisher, Rabbi of Thorn
(Russia) and its enthusiastic exponent, <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">Moses</span> Hess.
The chief aim of the Alliance Israelite Universelle was
political, and was clearly expressed in the report circulated
after its foundation in which was stated : All important faiths
are represented in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by nations, that is to say, they are

represented neither by a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> nor by a society, nor does it

THE INTERNATIONAL
( F I R S T AND

SECOND)

(Founded 1860)

In his early days, Karl Marx, later to be the moving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
the First International, edited a paper in Paris, Annates
Franco-Allemandes, the organ of a secret society. This paper
had been founded by Arnold Riige, a disciple of Mazzini.
Marx met Riige through Henri Heine, the celebrated poet. l
Heckethorn, in his Secret Societies of All Ages and
Countries gives an interesting synopsis of the early phases of
this movement destined ultimately to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the keystone of
subversion throughout the world. 2
" The first attempt at an international <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was made by
a small <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of German workmen in London, who had
been expelled from France in 1839 for taking part in the riots
in Paris. Its members consisted of Germans, Hungarians,
Poles, Danes and Swedes. Of the few English members Ernest
Jones was one. The <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was on friendly terms with the
English Socialists, the Chartists, and the London French

Society. Out of that friendship sprang the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of the
Fraternal Democrats, who were in correspondence with a
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of democratic societies in Belgium. In November,
1847, a German Communist Conference was held in London,
at which Dr. Karl Marx (real name Morde-chai) was present.
In the manifesto then put forth it was declared that the aim of
the Communists was the overthrow of the rule of the
capitalists by the acquisition of political power. The practical
measures by which this was to be effected were the abolition
of private property in <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> ; the centralization of credit in the
<span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> — the leading agitators of course to be the
chiefs of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> — by means of a national bank ; the
centralization of the means of transport in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> ; national workshops ; the reclamation and improvement
of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> ; and the gratuitous education of all the children.
" In 1860, a Trade Unionist, Manhood Suffrage, and Vote
by Ballot Association was established, of which G. Odger, a
shoemaker, was chairman. As if it had not enough of what
might be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> legitimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to do, the association also
undertook to agitate in favour of Poland, for which purpose it
co-operated with the National League for the Independence of
Poland. The London International Exhibition of 1862 induced
the French government to assist many French workmen with
means to visit that exhibition... " and "... on the 5th August, all
the delegates met at a dinner given to them by their English
colleagues at Freemason's Hall, where an address was read
which formed, as it were, the foundation-stone of the International. The Imperial Commission that had enabled the
French workmen to visit the London Exhibition had no doubt
furnished them with return tickets. But several of the artisans
made no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of their <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>

halves, since profitable employment in London was found for
them by their English brethren, so that they might <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
connecting links between the workmen of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> countries. "
The next year, another meeting was arranged and this was
followed by others. At last one was held in London on Sept.
24, 1864, presided over by Professor Beesly, at which it was
finally determined to establish a permanent organization of
the working <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the civilized world. The International
Working Men's Association was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> founded. In The Jewish
Encyclopaedia, Article on Karl Marx, we read that Mazzini
and Marx were entrusted with the task of preparing the
address and the constitution. Then came the big public
meeting held on September 28, 1864 at St. Martin's Hall,
which " declared the International Working Men's
Association to be established and congresses were appointed
to be held at different times and places to decide on the
measures to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to found the working men's Eldorado.
Many societies at first were affiliated, but dissensions soon
broke out among them, and many, such as the Italian Working
Men's Society, withdrew again. " 3
This withdrawal of the Italian section was doubtless
influenced by its recognition of the subversion of the original
scheme for the amelioration of industrial conditions by the
Mazzinian revolutionary agents.
" At a meeting held in London, in 1865, the '
re-establishment of Poland entire and independent ' was again
one of the questions discussed. The Paris delegates were for
avoiding political questions; but Mr. Odger reminded them
that Poland had furnished the occasion for the establishment
of the association,
3. Heckethorn, op. cit.

and that the Conference must stand by the Polish cause.
"
In 1866, a meeting or congress was held at Geneva, where
the abolition of standing armies, the destruction of the
monopolies of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> companies, and the transfer of railways
and other means of locomotion to the people, were decided on.
Another resolution favouring Polish Independence was
passed and the report of Marx made in 1864 was adopted.

expropriation of all existing proprietors, by the abolition of
the political and legal state, which is the sanction and only
guarantee of all property as now existing, and of all that is

and as much and as quickly as possible by the force of events
and circumstances. ' " 4
After such remarks, the International was evidently
considered by its masters to have shown its mettle and to be
deserving of better quarters. " A temple worthy of their cult
was sought and found... near Geneva, where... a fine building,
the Masonic Temple — Temple Unique... was procured. ...
They put the name of Temple on their cards and bills. Their
cult had gained a worthy shrine... " 5
The further aims of the movement are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described by

permitted the International (which claimed to be a social,
non-political organization), to grow in order, some day, to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
it against a mutinous bourgeoisie. The Emperor had an
opportunity on September 2, at Sedan, and the Empress on
September 4, at Paris, to judge of the value of such policy.
However, the scheme of the association having been settled in
London in 1864, the organizers opened at Paris a bureau de
correspondance, which was neither formally interdicted nor
regularly authorized by the Prefect and the Minister. But the

the government either to direct or to destroy it. The Parisian
manifesto read at Geneva was stopped at the French frontier ;
but M. Rouher agreed to admit it into France, if the

for what he had done for the working classes —a suggestion
which was received with derision by the members. In the

Garibaldi, Blanqui, and Ledru-Rollin were the oracles, looked
with suspicion on the foundation of the International; for, as

amidst the multitude of working men's societies of all
descriptions that were either authorized or at least tolerated,

themselves able to do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any extraneous support. ' The

(1869), ' is and must be a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> states ; let these go on as

of these, we shall erect our own fully prepared, such as it
exists in every section. '
" On September 3rd 1870, the disaster of Sedan became
known at Paris. On the next day, Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse,
and Paris proclaimed the Republic. This simultaneous
movement was the result of an understanding existing
between the leading members of the International in the
various parts of France ; but that the 'Jules Favres and
Gambettas, ' that vermine bourgeoise, as the International

galling to the demagogues. At Lyons and Marseilles, however,
the supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> fell into the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of the lowest wretches.

the red flag — that of the International. At Paris the
association pretended at first to be most anxious to fight the
Prussians. When the battalions were sent to the front, however,
it was found that those comprising most Internationals were
the most ready ' to fall back in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> order, ' or even to fly in

Thomas pointed out this instructive <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> to the readers of the
Journal Officiel. But when a few Prussian regiments entered
Paris, the Internationa1, through its central committee,
announced that the moment for action was come ; and so the
members seized the cannons scattered in various parts of the
city,

and then began that series of excesses, for which the
Commune will always enjoy an infamous notoriety. Its first
sanguinary act was the assassination of Generals Lecomte
and Clement Thomas. 6
" One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have supposed that the International <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
disavow the Communists : but, on the contrary, it approved of
their proceedings. Flames were still ascending from the Hotel
de Ville when already numerous sections of the International
throughout Europe expressed their admiration of the conduct
of the Parisian outcasts.
" At Zurich, at a meeting of the members of the
International, it was declared that ' the struggle maintained by
the Commune of Paris was just and worthy, and that all
thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> ought to join in the contest. ' "

In 1872, another Jew, Karl Marx, transferred " the seat of
the General Council to New York, in care of his faithful
follower F. A. Sorge ", his co-religionist. 7 There the
organization
degenerated
into
a

of
Anarchist-revolutionaries. In 1876 it was dissolved.
Numerous efforts to re-create the First International were
made by Marx assisted by Jules Guesde and in 1889 they
founded the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> International, the development of which
was retarded by internal dissensions. In 1905 however a

THE KU-KLUX KLAN
(Founded 1865)
The Ku-Klux Klan was the name of an American secret
association formed by the Whites of the Southern States for
self protection after the Civil war.
It was started at 1865 at Pulaski, Tennessee, as a club for
young men. The period of organization of the K. K. K. lasted
from 1865 to 1868. It absorbed other societies of similar aims
such as the Knights of the White Camelia, the White
Brotherhood, the White League, the Pale Faces, Black
Cavalry, White Rose, etc.
Apart from the protection of whites, one of its chief aims
was opposition to a government based on negro suffrage such
as the North wanted to impose on the South.
The Klan denominated the entire South as the Invisible
Empire under the rule of a Grand Wizard : General N. B.
Forrest. Each <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> was a Realm under a Grand Dragon; each
county a Province under a Grand Giant, etc.
The avowed principles were the maintenance of <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and
order, of the laws of God, of the political and social
supremacy of the white race and also the prevention of the
intermingling of the races.

It showed strenuous opposition to the " scallawags " and "

incited the negroes to commit all kinds of depredations
against the Whites of the South.
In 1871 and 1872, the United States Congress enacted a
series of " Force Laws " to break the K. K. K. By that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
however the negro was once more subdued and the K. K. K.'s
central organization was disbanded.

SOCIETAS ROSICRUCIANA IN ANGLIA
(Founded 1866)
For an historical sketch of the Societas Rosicruciana in
Anglia, the cover name for modern Illuminism, we can do no
better than turn to such an authority as its historian William
Wynn Westcott, erstwhile Supreme Magus of the Society.
The following items of information are gleaned from his
History of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, published in
1910. 1 The official statement of the aims of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> reads
as follows :— " The aim of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is to afford mutual aid
and encouragement in working out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span>

" The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was founded in 1866
by Frater Robert Wentworth Little, an eminent Freemason
with much literary talent, and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> personal popularity. He
was Secretary of the Province of Middlesex, and Secretary of
the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls. He became the first
Supreme Magus and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> General of the College in 1867.
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and authority emanated from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sources, and
were supplemented by the learning and researches of several
other prominent students of occult philosophy. Brother
William Henry White, the Grand Secretary of England,
preserved certain Rosi-crucian papers2 which had ccme into
his possession on attaining office in 1810, at Freemason's Hall,
and ot these he made no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> ; Brother Little fouud these
papers and <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> them. At the same time, and with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of re-constituting a Rosicrucian College in London, he
availed himself of certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and authority which
belonged to Brother Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, who had,
during a stay in Germany in earlier life, been in
communication with German Adepts who claimed a descent
from previous generations of Rosi-crucians. German Adepts
had admitted him to some grades of their system, and had
permitted him to attempt the formation of a group of Masonic
students in England, who under the Rosicrucian name might
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a partly esoteric society. With this license and with the
manuscripts of ritual information, which Brother White had
discovered in the vaults of Freemason's Hall, Fratres R. W.
Hughan, Woodman, O'Neal Haye, Irwin and some others, the
present English rituals were adopted, and have been in <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
2. Part of these papers are presumed to be some of Nick
Stone's rituals.

with some modifications made by Dr. Woodman and his
successor, ever since the first regular meeting of the Society.
" The basic rule of the new <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> stated that only <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span>
Masons of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> standing and repute should be admitted to

have no previous record ; for earlier English Rosicrucian
Colleges had no Masonic basis, and some fraternities abroad
certainly admitted women on equal terms, of which <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> there
is extant literary proof.
" See the curious document <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ' The admission of
Sigismund Bacstrom, dated September 12th 1794 '. This will
be found reprinted in The Rosicrucian of October, 1876. The
only literary extant evidence of the source of our Rosicrucian
ritual from Brother W. H. White is contained in a letter in
possession of the Society. The share of Kenneth Mackenzie in
the origin of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> depends at the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> on his

Dr.
Westcott.
" Fratres Hughan, Irwin, Hockley, Woodforde and
Benjamin Cox have also contributed their personal

" The original MSS. which Little possessed never came
into the possession of the S. M., the late Dr. Woodman, and so
were never received by the present Magus who has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> few
proofs in writing of the historic basis, which he lays down in
this sketch of the Society. The most natural conclusion is that
Little returned these papers to some obscure portion of the
records at Freemason's Hall, and that they are there still,
although the present officials have not traced them. This
explanation is very probable, because in September 1871, a
Brother

Mathew Cooke raised a complaint in Grand Lodge against
Masonic officials for discovering, using and removing old
manuscripts from the record rooms of Freemason's Hall.
These papers supplied the basis for the reconstitution of the

Rosicrucian Society. They were both Christian bodies, and
their records had been hidden away since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the
Grand Mastership of the Duke of Sussex, in 1813, who,

remove Christian grades from notice.
" Our records include a letter from the Rev. T. F.
Ravenshaw, Grand Chaplain of England, one of the earliest
fratres of the Society, confirming much of the historic
information which the author received from Dr. Woodman,
Woodforde, Mackenzie and Irwin. This letter recites as
follows : — (I) that the first S. M. Frater R. M. Little
explained to him that the German Fraternity had an
established regulation which permitted distinguished
members to confer Rosicrucian grades in due <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> on
suitable persons. (II) That a certain Venetian Ambassador to
England in the last century had conferred Rosicrucian grades
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on Students in England; these in their turn had
handed on the rule and tradition to others, oi whom one of the
last survivors was Frater William Henry White, Grand
Secretary of English Freemasonry from 1810 to 1857 ; he
retired and lived until 1866. (Ill) From the papers he
possessed Frater White admitted Frater Robert Wentworth
Little. (IV) These papers came into Little's possession at
Freemason's Hall on Frater White's retirement from office.
(V)The rituals are mentioned as being imperfect for
ceremonial open use. "
The above contains much useful information for any reader
who might later undertake research <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

" The <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> being purely literary and

intended, or even tolerated : and it matters not to the members

Masonry, as interpreted by the Grand Lodge of England, or be

In connection with the statement made at the opening of
this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> that The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was
modern Illuminism, the reader's attention must be drawn to
the similarity of the grades of the modern Rosicrucian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span>
with those of Weis-haupt's Bavarian Uluminism.
Much has been said and <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by various and numerous
English authorities on the subject of English Grand Lodge
being in no <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> connected with any outside societies,
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> exoteric or esoteric or with foreign or, as they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it,
" Continental " masonry.
We however submit the following suggestions as a logical
deduction from a close study of the organization, activities
and connections of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia.
English Grand. Lodge is today what it was intended to be at
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of its creation, by disciples of avowed
Rosicrucianism, namely a dragnet or nursery. Under the guise
of philanthropy, humanitarianism, democratic ideals, and the
promise of material advancement, it attracts untold numbers
of unsuspecting men. The sifting takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
their initiation. For those who are deemed useless to the
further secret aims of Masonry and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> unworthy of
climbing from the Master's chair in Grand Lodge to The
Royal Arch degree, English Masonry will always remain what
it was represented to be when they became candidates for
initiation. They will be useful carriers of the legend that
English Masonry believes in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and philanthropy. But, like
Charity, English Grand Lodge covers a multitude of sins....
Above all, it covers Gnosticism under all its aspects ; it is in
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> its screen.

OCCULT THEOCRACY

It is a common error to believe that the Enghsn Grand
Lodge is an independent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which was formed in 1717.
Logical deduction will show that, owing to its formation
being the result of Rosicrucian effort, it always has been, and
still must be, subject to the direction of its esoteric parent
body, i. e. ROSICRUCIA-NISM or Manichean and Socinian
Gnosticism.
Childish as may be the claim of English Grand Lodge as to
its autonomy and independence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it has been most
successfully defended by scores of English writers who
attacked Masonic Societies and their subversive activities
against <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> and religion. According to them English Grand
Lodge was always exempted from such groups.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to put an end to this legend. English Grand Lodge,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which claims to represent English Freemasonry, is
as much the child of Rosicrucianism today as it was in 1717
and has no more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or wish today to rebel against, or deny
its parent, than it had then. As to Esoteric Rosicrucianism,
this Esoteric body, mainly Cabalistic in its direction, always
has been and is in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> international. It has penetrated every
association, <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> or organization just as did the Illuminati
of Bavaria at the Wilhelmsbad convent of 1782.
In the particular Gnostic Rosicruciana in Anglia, briefly
sketched here, we see internationalism clearly depicted. At
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it was personified in Kenneth Mackenzie who,
initiated and illuminized by the German Rosicrucian adepts,
was later the connecting link between German, English and
French Gnosticism, the latter represented at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> by
Eliphas Levi (A. L. Constant).
Nearer to our own time, William Wynn Westcott is the
connecting link of this international Rosicru-

cian-gnosticism. Prominent Grand Lodge and Royal Arch
Mason, he was also Supreme Magus of Rosicru-ciana in
Anglia and Knight Kadosch etc.
His connections with John Yarker, as also with the French
hermetist Papus and with the theosophist Blavatsky, were of
an esoteric kind, but most important of all were his close
relations with his brother Rosicrucian MacGregor Mathers
and the German Theodore Reuss. For it is, we know, William
Wynn Westcott, the respected English Grand Lodge and
Royal Arch Mason, Supreme Magus of Rosicru-ciana in
Anglia who, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the Cabalist MacGregor Mathers,
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the Rosicrucian branch known as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of the
Golden Dawn. With Theodore Reuss he was closely
associated with the foundation of the Ordo Templi Orientis
which from Reuss and Karl Kellner's manuscripts is known to
be phallic.
How far the reciprocal conferring of degrees in their
respective orders between John Yarker, W. W. Westcott,
Theodore Reuss, Engel and Papus is a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of interpenetration
remains to be determined. John Yarker was the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the
Ancient and Primitive Rite of the Rite of Swedenborg, etc.,
Wm. Wynn Westcott, the Supreme Magus of Rosicruciana in
Anglia, Theodore Reuss and Engel, heads of the German
Illuminati and Ordo Templi Orientis, and Papus, <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the
Martinists. We are fully aware of the Gnostic practices of
these different rites but the student bent on a certain type of
research will <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> interesting and instructive the study of the
political activities of the different bodies mentioned. The

THE CLAN-NA-GAEL (V. C.)
(Founded 1869)
In his oft quoted book, The Secret Societies of Ireland,
Captain H. B. C. Pollard, late of the Staff of the Chief of
Police, Ireland, gives much valuable information concerning
the Clan-na-Gael (See page 69 et seq.).
" In 1869 a new secret Irish-American organization was
formed, known as the Clan-na-Gael. It traces its origin back
through a permanent secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> known as the Knights of
the Inner Circle, which, in turn, descended from the Knights
of St. Patrick, known as the Ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Hibernians
to-day. It was originally a seceding circle (The Brian Boru) of
the United Irishmen, an American <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> tracing back
to 1789. "
By 1873, the Clan had absorbed all independent Irish secret
societies save that of " The Irish Confederation " of Jeremiah
O'Donovan Rossa with which it had reached an arrangement
for mutual toleration.
" The original organizer of the Clan had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it the United
Brotherhood, and in all its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> a simple letter cipher
composed of the next letter in the alphabet after the one really
meant, was utilised. The secret name of the Clan being the
United Brotherhood, it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> designated and spoken

Clan speaks and writes of the I. R. B. as the S. C.

chairman. A Revolutionary Directory, the ' R. D. ' consisted of
seven members \.. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> secrecy shrouded the R. D. and the

" These Lodges or ' Camps ' were known in cipher as ' D's ';
each had a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> and an outward innocent name, such as the
Emmett Literary Association. The essential precaution for the
maintenance of secrecy was the rule that all documents, when
read, had to be burnt before the Brotherhood, a rule also
common to the I. R. B. of today. "
" An open Irish movement had been evolving in the States 2
and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Irish Convention was held at Chicago in
November, 1881, where all kinds of Irish associations were to

the Clan secured the office of Chairman to one of its members,
the Rev. George Betts, and as he had the right of appointment
of all members of committees, they were enabled to nominate
a Clan-na-Gael majority and force the Clan views on the

organization in America, now also controlled all the various
open Irish societies and associations which had been

of the Clan was exerted to secure to their members a
preponderant representation as office-holders in these

in local Irish affairs. 3

in America. The process developed by the I. R. B. in Ireland
was analogous ; through its members they were represented
on the Committees and Councils of practically every
organization which, in the opinion of its leaders, could be of
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to it. The identity of the I. R. B. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> was always a secret.

on all questions of appointment to positions and offices in
various open associations, and it was its influence and
corruption which achieved those mysterious appointments to
position of persons singularly devoid of merit, which were,
and are, a marked feature of Irish life...
" In so far as the activist military policy of the I. R. B. was
concerned, the period from 1895 to 1912 was practically
negative.
" The I. R. B. had always held that membership of any
sectarian secret society, such as the A. 0. H., or the Orange

ANARCHISTS

(Founded 1872)

Anarchists claim direct descent from Diderot and those
factions which during the French Revolution of 1789 had
formed the clubs of the Enrages and Hebertistes. Prudhon
was their prototype.
Chronologically speaking, however, the Anarchist party
was formed on Sept. 29, 1872, when a split occurred in the
ranks of the participants in the Hague Congress of the
International Association of Workers, numbers siding with
Bakunin whilst others rallied round Karl Marx.
Bakunin's adherents formed the Anarchist party and
organized in Switzerland the " Federation Juras-sienne "
which soon extended its ramifications to Northern Italy,
Eastern France and Spain. The Federation's tenets were
plainly anarchistic, urging terrorism as the means of
overthrowing all forms of existing governments. The attempt

<span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span>

(Founded 1875)
The Theosophical Society, with nine degrees, was founded
in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891) daughter
of Colonel Peter Hahn and granddaughter of General Alexis
Hahn von Rottenstern Hahn, of Mecklenburg, Germany,
settled in Russia. When very young, she married Niciphore
Blavatsky, Councillor of State, from whom she separated
after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months.
As regards the founder of this order, Rene Guenon, who
has made a close study of Theosophy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> briefly sketches
her career.
" Mme. Blavatsky's extraordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of adventure started

Having quarrelled with her family, she was unable to go to
Russia so she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to London where she frequented spiritistic
and revolutionary circles. She was initiated into the Carbonari
by Mazzini in 1856 and was also an initiate of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of the
Druses, according to John Yarker.
About this period, (1856) her Mahatma Morya is supposed
first to have manifested. The Mahat-mas Morya and Koot

" Towards 1858, Madame Blavatsky decided to return to
Russia; she became reconciled with her father, staying with

husband. A little later she was in Italy whither she seemed to
have been summoned by a Car-bonarist order; in 1866, she
was with Garibaldi, whom she accompanied during his
expeditions, she fought at Viterbo, then at Mentana, where
she was seriously wounded and <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> on the field as dead ; she

journalist, was a Freemason as was also his friend Rivail

Folies-Marigny and the pioneer of French spiritism. It was
Michal who developed the medium-istic faculties of Madame

source of information and who has also closely followed the
activities of Madame Blavatsky during this period of her life,
refers to her visit to America in the following terms :
" In 1875 Madame Blavatsky was sent from Paris to
America where she met Henry Steel Olcott and where on
October 20, 1875, a society, said to be for ' spiritualist
investigations ', was founded in New York.
" Olcott was President, Felt and Dr. Seth Pancoast
vice-presidents, and Madame Blavatsky Secretary. Among
other members were William Q. Judge, Charles Sothern, one
of the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> dignitaries of American Masonry, also for a short
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> General Albert Pike, Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of the Scottish Rite

of this connection with Pike and Luci-ferianism at this period
requires no further comment!
Guenon, detailing this American visit of Madame
Blavatsky, further explains how " George H. Felt, self-styled
Professor of Mathematics and Egyptologist, had been
introduced to Madame Blavatsky by a journalist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

Madame Blavatsky and Olcott had both joined this <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span>
from which they were expelled before they <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> America.
A letter from John Yarker quoted in Freemasonry
Universal (Vol V, part 2 Autumn Equinox, 1929) is
here relevant. It states that Madame Blavatsky's
masonic certificate in the Ancient and Primitive Rite
of Masonry was issued in the year 1877.
Yarker writes " Both the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim,
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Grand Orient of France, possessed a Branch of
Adoptive Masonry, popular in France in the 18th century and
of which, in later years, the Duchess of Bourbon held the
Rank of Grand Mistress.

said to have been instituted at Saxe in the last quarter of the

" In November, 1878 ", according to ' Inquire Within', "
Madame Blavatsky and Olcott <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> for India, and in 1882
founded the Theosophical centre in Adyar, near Madras ;
there she initiated her ' esoteric section ', and contacted the

In 1887, when Madame Blavatsky settled in London, she

In the year 1889, Mr. MacGregor Mathers, 8th degree
Rosicruciana in Anglia, wrote a letter to the editor of Lucifer
in which he stated that the Theosophical and Rosicrucian
Societies entertained very friendly relations 8 and this idea of "
friendly foreign relations " is further confirmed by Rene
Guenon who writes : " There are persons who believe that the

(Founded 1879)
The International Bible Student Movement was founded by
Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> chiefly of
attracting the lower middle class intelligentsia of Christian
communities such as certain clerical workers, teachers,
servants and persons not accessible to direct forms of
propaganda. In America the movement has had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
influence among the negro element.
In 1879 Russell founded The Watch Tower of which he
was the sole editor.
The Russellite teaching, drawing its own arbitrary
conclusions and proclaiming them as final, professes to prove
from Biblical sources that all Christian churches are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and

the Jews must henceforth reign supreme over the world. It
also elaborates an occult dogma alleged to be based on

THE AHMADIYYAH SECT
(Founded 1882)
The ahmadiyyah sect is described in an article by Fr.
Lawrence as having been founded in 1882 at Quadiam,
Punjab, by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who died in 1908. It
resembles in many ways Bahaism and attempts to conciliate
the oriental and occidental religions while its dogma, based
on the shi'a (unorthodox Mahometan) foundation of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
thought, embraces the buddhist belief, rites and
metempsychosis as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the idea of the occult Messiah.
In accordance with the Ismali theory of the advent of the
reincarnated mahdi at the opening of each century, this sect
proclaims their founder to have been the reincarnation of
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> for the XIV Century (XX of our era) and the harbinger
of the future Messiah.
An Indian branch of the sect endorses a legend according

KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
(Founded 1882)
The Knights of Columbus is the name of a Roman Catholic
organization founded in 1882, in the United States of
America, by a Roman Catholic priest, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> P. McGivney of
New Haven, Connecticut.
From the Roman Catholic paper, La Croix, of Paris, in the
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> dated December 20, 1913, we gather that, at that date,
the Knights of Columbus wielded an immense <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> with
which public authorities had to reckon. Their <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> then
was acknowledged to be more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred thousand.

Master, six pro-Grand Masters and a General Secretary. The
territory of the United States was divided into six provinces,
each province administered by one of the six pro-Grand
Masters. Each province was in turn subdivided in districts
administered by a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of the 4th degree and appointed by
the Grand Masters for a period of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> years. Districts were
subdivided in councils or chapters.
The Verite of Quebec, a Canadian paper, in August 1913,
put the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the councils at 1630. At that time, the
Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus was composed

much perturbation in the Roman Catholic Church.
Under cover of being an association for mutual help, it had
recruited a considerable <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of members whc believed
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> was fully approved by the Church authorities.
When however its activities <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> on the appearance of a
Masonic <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> with initiation rituals, symbolism and secret
oaths, many among the Catholic Clergy became alarmed.
Their fears were not allayed when it was known that the
leaders of the Knights of Columbus were having fraternal
exchanges of all kinds with the Oddfellows, Templars and
other Masonic bodies. The climax was reached when it was
rumoured that in Rome, the Knights of Columbus had
petitioned the Pope to allow their members to become, at least
in the United States, regular Masons.
The Knights of Columbus, like the Oddfellows, formed
lodges of adoption in 1913, women being enrolled under the
caption of " Daughters of Isabella ". Women lodges were
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> " courts ". In 1913, the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of " courts " was over
200 and the membership of " Daughters of Isabella " over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
hundred thousand.
Like the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> of Oddfellows and similarly to the O. T. O.
of the Rosicrucians the Knights of Columbus hold much
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over the property and various interests of their
members.
Due to their efforts in the direction of establishing a
universal religion and inter-confessionalism, the Knights of
Columbus have been considered by a large section of the

Although the Knights of Columbus and the Daughters of
Isabella have extended their ramifications into the United
Kingdom, it is in the United States that their strength mainly
resides. This is easily understood when one studies the
activities of Roman Catholics in America and realises that,
there, they are far more a political entity with subversive
tendencies than a religious body.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
(Founded 1883)
Christian Science was founded in 1883.
Mary Baker Eddy, the founder, was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in 1821 at Bow,
New Hampshire, U. S. A. and died in 1910.
Having suffered greatly all her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> from neurasthenia and
hysteria she developed mediumship at an early age. Spiritistic
sessions further revealed her psychic gifts but it is more than
likely that her early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of experimental psychic research
exposed her, in after years, to the horrors of what she later
described as " Malicious Animal Magnetism ", familiarly
referred to by her students as M. A. M.
At the age of 22, she married George Washington Glover, a
Freemason and Oddfellow, who <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> her to live at Charleston,
South Carolina, six months later. However he contracted
yellow fever while at Wilmington where he died in June 1844.
In 1853, she married Daniel Patterson, a medical
practitioner, from whom she was later separated.
In October 1862 she applied for medical assistance to
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (d. 1866) a healer, who had many
marvellous cures to his credit. His medical system was based
on an understanding of the scientific laws

It is claimed that she derived her system from him.
Her <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Science and Health was first published in 1875.
In 1877 she married Asa Gilbert Eddy who <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> her a
widow in 1882.
In 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical
College in Boston and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, when the movement

Science Journal.
On June 13, 1888, the National Christian Science
Association held its <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> annual meeting at Central Music
Hall, Chicago. This had been organized as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as advertised

listeners as an inspired oration. In <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the extraordinary
pitch of enthusiasm attained by her audience and knowing the
practice of " charging" public rooms or halls one is led to ask
oneself the question as to <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the assembly hall had been
specially "charged" for that particular meeting. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> Mrs.
Eddy herself, like the Sybils of ancient times, was also "
inspired" by outside hypnotic influence is another hypothesis
to conjure with.
From then on, Mrs. Eddy's religious future was assured.
Under her leadership suggestion became indeed the
foundation of a religion, a religion in which psychic force,
operating under suggestion, accomplishes definite <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
results.

she shrouded her past in mystery, refused -to tell her age, and
the town records were eventually burned. She grew up as one
of five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> which her father, Peabody Simmons,
carpenter, built with his own hands. When the family moved
to another Maine town, Damariscotta, Augusta was organist
there in the Methodist church and a singer in the choir. At 24
she married a ship-builder, Frederick Stetson, who was
partially an invalid as a result of imprisonment in Libby Prison
during the Civil War. As his wife, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to England where
he secured employment with a British shipbuilding firm. Later,
he was sent to Bombay, and here she had an opportunity to
delve into a subject in which she had an instinctive interest —
the oriental philosophies. In these philosophies affirmation
and denial play an important role, and a pantheistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is
postulated — a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> who is the Universe, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is All,

or expression in the midst of many. "
Mrs. Stetson started healing and teaching Mrs. Eddy's
system in New York in 1886, later resigning her connection
with the Christian Science church in 1909.
One can almost describe this system as emerging clearly
out of the realm of occultism, a kind of suggestion or
auto-suggestion, whereby practical beneficial results may be
induced in a patient by the application of certain occult laws
to their personal medical requirements.
Mrs. Eddy's dogma is summed up by Hudson in the
following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> :

" It follows of course that disease cannot exist in a
non-existent body. " 1
However, regardless of this paradox and the various
opinions hitherto expressed about Christian Science, we
recognize, while admitting the efficacy of Mrs. Eddy's <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of
the force of beneficent animal magnetism, that her personal
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the action of Malicious Animal Magnetism, so derided
by her theological adversaries, is logical and founded.
These forces operate on sound scientific lines and those
who can <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of suggestion to gain ascendency over

danger of such misapplication is not one to be disregarded in
calling in a healer, whatever Mrs. Eddy's detractors may say !
That danger is real and every student of the occult knows it.
The movement has become popular and has a following
among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of wealth who seem to become the easy prey of

THE FABIAN <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span>
(Founded 1883)
The nominal founder of The Fabian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> was Thomas
Davidson, an idealist who, in the hope of bettering the lot of
humanity, organized a debating club the original aim of
which was, according to Mr. Pease, author of The History of
the Fabian Society, " the reconstruction of <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> on a
non-competitive basis with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of remedying the evils
of poverty. " l
This non-competitive basis meant maintenance for all by
the community as a right, regardless of merit.
The club met fortnightly in the drawing rooms of its
various members and in 1884 adopted the name "The Fabian
Society".
Among those prominent in the movement in its early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span>
were : Frank Podmore, a spiritualist, Percival Chubb, a clerk
on the Local Government Board, Edward Pease, Hubert
Bland, J. Ramsay Macdonald, later Prime Minister of
England, R. B. Haldane, afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Haldane, George

controlled The Freethought Publishing Co., Dr. Pank-hurst,
husband of the later leader of the Women's Social and Political
Union and Mrs. Charlotte M. Wilson who, while retaining her
membership in the Fabian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> " devoted herself ", so we are told
by Mr. Pease, to the Anarchist movement led by Prince Kropotkin
and for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> edited the anarchist paper Freedom. On page 68
of The History of the Fabian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> by Edward R. Pease we read :
" In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to avoid a breach with Mrs. Wilson and her Fabian
sympathisers, it was resolved to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a Fabian Parliamentary
League, which Fabians could join or not as they pleased ; its
constitution, dated February, 1887, is given in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> in Tract No. 41 ;
here it is only necessary to quote one <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which describes the
policy of the League and of the Society, a policy of deliberate
possibilism :—
" The League will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> active part in all general and local
elections. Until a fitting opportunity arises for putting forward
Socialist candidates to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the nucleus of a Socialist party in
Parliament, it will confine itself to supporting those candidates who
will go furthest in the direction of Socialism. It will not ally itself
absolutely with any political party; it Will jealously avoid being
made <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of for party purposes ; and it will be guided in its action by
the character, record and pledges of the candidates before the
constituencies. In Municipal, School Board, Vestry, and other local
elections, the League will, as it finds itself strong enough, run
candidates of its own, and by placing trustworthy Socialists on local
representative bodies it will endeavour to-secure the recognition of
the Socialist principle in all the details of local government. "...
" The League first faded into a Political Committee of the Society,
and then merged silently and painlessly into the general body. "
The foregoing is interesting : first, — as showing the original
Anarchist connection with Fabian Socialism

THE

as we now know it, secondly, — as an example of one of the
most usual methods of subverting an existing organization.
An offshoot of the existing organization was here formed,
pledged to a policy or policies which might have been
repudiated by the parent body. This offshoot being destined to
eventual reabsorption into the parent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> could <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> assure
the successful " boring from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> " of the old organization.
We are further told by Mr. Pease that in 1888, " a
Universities Committee, with Frank Podmore as Secretary for
Oxford and G. W. Johnson for Cambridge, had begun the '
permeation ' of the Universities, which has always been an
important part of the propaganda of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> ".
By 1890, the support of a splendidly organized intelligentsia was assured to the socialist cause with the Fabian
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> as its propaganda centre and a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of local Fabian
societies were formed. They were succeeded by and merged
into branches of the Independent Labour Party.
On page 209 of Mr. Pease's book, we glean some more
enlightening information which definitely connects the
Fabians with the Jew-captured organization of the old
International
" The International Socialist and Trade Union Congresses,
held at intervals of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> since 1889, were at first
no more than isolated Congresses, arranged by local
organizations constituted for the purpose in the preceding year.
Each nation voted as one, or at most, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> units, and

Germany. But gradually the organization was tightened up,
and in 1907 a scheme was adopted

560

OCCULT THEOCRASY

which gave twenty votes each to the leading nations, and
proportionately fewer to the others. Moreover a permanent
Bureau was established at Brussels, with Emile Vandervelde,
the distinguished leader of the Belgian Socialists, later <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
known in England as the Ministerial representative of the
Belgian Government during the war, as Chairman. In England,
where the Socialist and Trade Union forces were divided, it
was necessary to constitute a special joint committee in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to raise the British quota of the cost of the Bureau, and to elect
and instruct the British delegates. It was decided by the
Brussels Bureau that the 20 British votes should be allotted ;
10 to the Labour Party, 4 to the I. L. P. (Independent Labour
Party) 4 to the British Socialist Party, into which the old S. D.
F. (Socialist Democratic Federation) had merged, and 2 to the
Fabian Society, and the British Section of the International
Socialist Bureau was, and still remains, constituted financially
and electorally on that basis. "
In the same <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> of his history, Mr. Pease explains that "
half of two-thirds of the Fabians belonged also to the I. L. P.
and nearly all the I. L. P. leaders were or had been members of
the Fabian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> ". The I. L. P. was founded in January
1893 by Keir Hardie and Fried-rich Engels, the disciple of

This first step is the destruction of present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> civilisation,

Their aim of Destruction is the same, only the method
whereby it is to be effected differs. This effort at destruction
accounts for the community of action of Socialists and
Anarchists throughout history.
According to the Anarchists : All must be destroyed in

the present system will fall of itself by the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> of certain
measures into law. These laws, while framed to appeal to

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to operate the International Destruction which is the
primary aim of both parties.
Writing of Babeuf and Buonarotti and their abortive
conspiracy of 1796, Professor H. J. Laski in The Socialist
Tradition in the French Revolution states that " the strategy
they (the Babouvists) invented has provided ever since the
methodology of revolutionary socialism at least in its large
outline ".
The Fabians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> numerous detached societies,

The new policy—or the plan for a new
policy—had its origin in a series of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>
parties held last year at Easton Lodge (the
Labour Chequers), when Socialist politicians, economists and trades unionists
foregathered at week-ends. Out of these
meetings grew the new Fabian Research
Bureau (of which Major Attlee is chairman
and Mr. Cole secretary), which received
the official blessing of the Labour
movement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> months ago and is now
established in premises in Abingdon

One of the chief ideals of this <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> is the extinction of
the poor as evidenced by the following extract from The

This ideal is to be achieved by the gradual expropriation and

It should here be noted that the tax question is handled no

The stranglehold of Fabian Babouvism on England may
however eventually be mitigated by an international
organization of taxpayers combining as a counter
revolutionary body. Who knows ?

HERMETIC <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span>
(Founded 1884)
This spiritistic <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> was founded in London on May 9,
1884, by Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland, both
members of the Theosophical Society.
According to R. Guenon, it advocates a Gnostic mixture
of Christianity and Buddhism.
For Anna Kingsford, as for Mme Blavatsky, the Christs are
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> who have succeeded in developing in themselves
certain superior powers latent in all men. This is presumably
the " Serpent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> " or Kundalini, the Sex Force. <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> is
not the historical personage <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> Christ. <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> is only an
initiate, one of " the Christs " incarnating through the ages in
different bodies, other incarnations of the " <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> force "
having been in the persons of Maitreya Bouddha, Krishna and
the various prophets of the other religions.
As a foundation for a Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> Religion, the idea is
a clever one but its consequences are that anyone who makes

the idea ad absurdum.
This is the principle which when further elaborated leads
to the usual Gnostic belief that " <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> ".

unfortunately, eventually leads to the abyss.
Anna Kingsford and her <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> were in close contact with

" R. W. Frater MacGregor Mathers (Comte Mac-Gregor de
Glenstrae), the present Junior Substitute Magus, was admitted
to Freemasonry in the Hengist Lodge at Bournemouth and
was an early member of the Correspondence Circle of the
Quatuor Coronati Lodge at which he was a frequent speaker
before he settled in Paris. He is a very famous occult student,
and has contributed several learned lectures to the
Metropolitan College. He is the author of the Kabalah
Unveiled, the Tarot Cards, The Key of Solomon the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> and

Mrs. MacGregor Mathers, the sister of Henri Berg-son, the
Jewish-French philosopher, received clair-voyantly most of
the early teaching still <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> from the " Hidden
Secret Chiefs of the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Order. " 3
A. E. Waite was an early member of the " Golden Dawn ",
but at a meeting held at Dr. Felkin's residence in 1903,
according to Dr. Felkin's history, " a split occurred, as Waite
and his followers denied the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Order,

Illuminati in England <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> establishing the interlocking directorate

In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the 0. T. 0. the practice of the " secret <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span>

of fluid or invisible fire. It is the To Ov of neo-platonism of
which Godfrey Higgins writes : "I am convinced that the
emanation of the To Ov was believed to be this fire. "
The To Ov was supposed to be duplicate, then from that to
triplicate. From him proceeded the male Logos, and the
female Aura or Anima or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Ghost in ancient times always

The Equinox states that " it was Karl Kellner who revived
the esoteric organization of the 0. T. 0. and initiated the plan

In the " Gnostic Mass " printed in the same volume,

574

OCCULT THEOCRASY

mention is made, in one of the orisons, of the saints among
which are named Karl Kellner and Theodore Reuss.
From notes <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by Theodore Reuss himself and from
correspondence between him and Karl Kellner, the basic
principles of the 0. T. 0. have become known and bear out the
statement that this organization was formed for the express
purpose of substituting the phallic religion for Christianity.
The conception of the O. T. O. was far from being original
but it was undoubtedly reformed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Germans above
named. 2 It was no vain boast on the part of the writer in The
Equinox to name all the orders as concentrated in the O. T. O.,
for proof has been obtained that both Karl Kellner and
Theodore Reuss were, among a host of others, in close
masonic relationship with John Yarker, William Wynn
Westcott, Supreme Magus of Soc. Rosicruciana in Anglia, a
Warden of the Grand Lodge of England, Papus of the
Martinists, etc.
Apparently all concurred in the formation of the esoteric
doctrine of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Oriental Templars.
In the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris is filed a document,
dated 1917, containing the constitution and certain
information concerning the O. T. O. It states that " The
Ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of Oriental Templars ", an organization
formerly known as The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, has
been re-organized and re-constituted.
As evidenced by the Reuss papers, one may gather that the
O. T. O. has existed since 1902. Prior to 1917, the official
date of its foundation, it was presumably
a secret
organization, operating under

Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites, acting, as these papers
indicate, as the link between this organization and the various
unofficial International occult groups. 3
The prominent persons connected with this organization at
its start were : John Yarker, William Wynn Westcott, Papus,
Karl Kellner, Theodore Reuss, Mac-Gregor Mathers, Franz
Hartmann and Aleister Crowley.
Apart from its secret phallic doctrine the 0. T. 0. seeks to
unite with a revival of Gnosticism, the study of the Jewish
Cabala, Esoteric Lamaism and Indian Yogism. It seeks to
extract from their combined doctrines the practical
application of Eastern Sorcery and Western Witchcraft,
wherein medicine and hypnotism occupy a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of prime
importance, serving solely materialistic ends.
The reader can always be referred to the press for
descriptions of the practices of the present Chief of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span>
who was obliged to leave Italy following an investigation into
his magic practices at Cefalu near Palermo in Sicily.
Calling himself " The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> Therion", Aleister Crowley is
also known under the name of Frater Per-durabo and, from his
own extravagant writings, we know that he looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
himself as a reincarnation of Eliphas Levi etc. etc.
To give the reader a feeble idea of the perversion of the O.
T. O. we quote the following : — " The blood is the life. This
simple statement is explained by the Hindus by saying that the
blood is the principal vehicle

honest and harmless ; and makes no false pretences ; if its

of witches into cats, horses and other animals arose from
references by other witches to craft adepts by the costumes

In November 1894 William Q. Judge rebelled against Mrs.
Besant's domination of The Theosophical Society.
On April 27th, 1895, he and his followers seceded from the
Adyar <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> and constituted an independent organization
under the name " Theosophical <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of America ". This
organization, which still exists, has its headquarters at
Point-Loma, California, It was first presided over by Ernest
Hargrove and later by Katherine A. Tingley. It has branches
in Sweden and Holland.
Katherine A. Tingley, known to her followers as " The

FEIN

(Founded 1905)

Sinn Fein, an Irish patriotic organization advocating
boycott and passive resistance against England was founded
by Arthur Griffiths in 1905. He was succeeded as president in
1917 by Eamon de Valera. By that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> was
controlled and subsidized by the Clan-na-Gael and Germany.
After the start of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War in 1914, it asserted itself
as the open foe of England.
Richard Dawson in Red Terror and Green, page 176,
publishes a despatch sent to Count von Bernstorff, the
German Ambassador in the United States at that date. The
document was marked " very secret " and dated April 18,
1916. It reads as follows :
" Judge Cohalan (of New York, U. S. A.) requests the
transmission of the following remarks : The revolution in
Ireland can only be successful with the support of Germany :
otherwise England will be able to suppress it, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it

"1
The part played by the Irish-Roman Catholic church in
Irish National and International politics is gathered from the
following telegram from Count von Berns-torff to the
German Foreign Office.
" The Bishop of Cork having died, there is a sharp contest
over the succession. The present Assistant Bishop, Daniel
Cohalan, is the choice of the local clergy ; but England is
using unusual efforts to have — appointed. — is strongly
anti-German, although Germany, at our request, released him
shortly after the outbreak of war. Assistant-Bishop Cohalan is
cousin of Judge Cohalan, and strongly Nationalist and
pro-German. He was the intermediary between the insurgent
Cork Volunteers and the British military authorities, and
publicly exposed the gross breach of <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> of the English with
the surrendered men. Hence the effort to defeat him through

SUFISM

CXIX

(OCCIDENTAL)

(Founded 1910)
In his history of Persia, Sir John Malcolm devotes much
space to Sufism or Sopheism.
It is supposed to have been the esoteric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
Mohammedan religion and in the possession of Ali and his
successors.
Sufism in Persia dates from A. D. 1500 to 1736 when the
kingdom was conquered by Nadir Shah.
Godfrey Higgins, in Anacalypsis, concludes that Sufism "
is Gnosticism and that if we can discover the one we shall
discover the other. " He tells us however that their (Sufist)
sect has four stages or degrees and that they have " a species
of Masonic or Eleusinian initiation from lower to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
degrees. "
The subtle metaphysics of Sufism are contained in the
Dabistan and their esoteric teaching is centred around the
principle of life. It is essentially pantheistic, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> beirg an
emanation of God's essence.
The teaching of Sufism was introduced by Knayat-Khan
into the West in 1910. The centre of teaching

is at Geneva and a big temple has recently been built at

France.
Sufism is Islamic Mysticism and adapts itself to all
dogmas.

The Narodna Odbrana was founded in 1911 by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
known Dr. Karl Kramarsch, the organizer of the Panslavic
movement. It claimed to be a patriotic Serbian organization
pledged to <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> Serbia from Austrian influence and to achieve
specifically the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Its secret lodge however was closely affiliated to the Crna
Ruka (The Black Hand, a terrorist society) and it had
absorbed the large and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known Slav organization "
Omladina ".
" Sokol ", a group of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> culture clubs, served as a
mask for the wider activities of the Narodna Odbrana in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was stated as a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> by
Cubrilovitch during his trial following the murder of the
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28th, 1914,
which precipitated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> War.
The trial for <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> treason of Vangaluka which lasted from
Nov. 15 to the spring of 1916 gives a short idea of the
activities of the Narodna Odbrana.
Its aim, the grouping of all the Slav southern states into

who had prepared the attempt. He had travelled abroad
extensively, visited all the Lodges and had returned with
revolvers and bombs. Among the murderers, Sovanovitch,
Cabrinovitch and Grabez were Freemasons and Veliko
Cubrilovitch was member of Narodna Odbrana and Sokol.
Gabriel Prinzip, a student, a youth ot 19, the murderer of
the Archduke, was found to have received arms through
Major Tankosich, a Freemason and a friend of the Serbian
Crown Prince Alexander, His assistant assasin, the
bomb-thrower Cabrinovitch, stated openly at his trial that in
Masonry, killing was permissible, adding further that the heir
to the throne oi Austria had been condemned to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> by the

been found to execute the sentence.
The Serbians however could not divulge the secrets of the
Serbian Lodge Narodna Odbrana which, in secret alliance
with the Crna Ruka had organized the murder of the
Archduke, heir to the Austrian throne. The documents
concerning the organization of this murder were however
made known and available from the diary of the Serbian
Major Todorovitch which was found in Loczinka, and it was
clearly demonstrated at the trial for <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> treason of the
bomb-thrower Cabrinovitch that the leading personalities of
the Narodna Obrana were Freemasons. (Refer Kolnische
Volkzeitung. Nov. 1914.).

Steiner into the Anthroposophical Society. Later, however,
he reverted also to his old allegiance.
Soon after its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> it practically merged with the
Theosophical Society.
Stsiner was a friend of Dr. Hubbe Schleiden, the Secretary
General of the German Theosophical <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> and President
of several German secret societies, the Druidenorden, Black
Templars, Rosicrucians, Ygdrasil.
The headquarters of the cult and its chief temple " The
Goetheaneum" are at Dornach, Switzerland. This building, a
crude " Noah's Ark " specimen of architecture, flaunts the
symbol of the cult above its main portal, while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> its

innocence and ideals to plunge it into the
grossest
materialism.

" The foundation of the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> International had immensely
facilitated the spread of Bolshevism by providing the Soviet
Government with a camouflage for its activities. No longer
could groups or individuals working in co-operation with
Moscow be accused of having dealings with a foreign power,
but only with an independent Socialist organization.
"By the end of 1919 the Komintern had spread its tentacles
all over Europe. In December of that year the West European
Secretariat of the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> International, a marvellous
organization controlling a network of smaller organizations,
both open and secret, was established at a Conference
attended by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Britain. At a further Conference at

Secretariat as a Central European Secretariat, with

In August 1922, the Convention of the Communist Party of
America was raided at Bridgeman, Mich., and numerous
revolutionary documents were seized by the United States

Manifold requests for the recognition of the Soviet

activities resulting from and flowing out of the program

THE FASCISTI
(Founded 1919)

From their activities one may assume the Fascisti to be the
descendants of the Calderari.
After the European War of 1914 certain banks, conscious
of the menace of Satanism, ultimately rechris-tened
Bolshevism, fearing that the monster might get out of hand,
selected certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> integrity, patriotism and bravery
they trusted and, by paying them a stipend, kept them as a
nucleus, ready, when the signal was given, to rally to a leader.
Fascism was founded at Milan on March 23, 1919 and
Benito Mussolini became the leader of " the First Fifty-Five
".
On October 27, 1922, the Fascisti marched on Rome.
At a meeting convoked previously, seventy-two
socialist-bolshevist leaders had been summarily dealt with,

NOT WELCOMED BY

The Italian Freemasons, suppressed by
Mussolini, have sought refuge in England,

Officials of the Grand Orient of Italy in
March wrote to the Grand <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> of
English Freemasons stating that as they
had been compelled to reconstitute
themselves outside their own country,
they

had settled temporarily in London.
They added that they had no intention of
disregarding the tradition of nationality by
which Freemasonry was governed or the
territorial rights "which belonged to the
Grand Lodge of England. They also
asserted that they had no <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to make
<span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the sovereignty of the Grand Orient
on the territory of the United Kingdom.
"VIEWED WITH SURPRISE"
The Board of General Purposes, in its
report to Grand Lodge for the -meeting on
June 3, says that it has " viewed with
surprise" the receipt of this letter, and has
sent the following answer :
" The statement in your letter that the
Grand Orient of Italy has settled
temporarily in London has occasioned
considerable surprise. I am instructed to
protest against the action of the Grand
Orient... "

The Anti-Saloon League, the organization which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

headed by H. Fairchild, who became its first President.
The suggestion made by F. Scott McBride, General
superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League, before the Senate

of Prohibition in America, The Anti-Saloon League, was

" What authority have you for claiming that the

" Did you get a message from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> that He gave birth to

"No. "
" Then what notice did you receive that this had been a

" Oh ! So the league dons the cloak of religion ! "
" We do not don the cloak, it is real religion. "
Then Senator Blain, launching into the fray, exclaimed :
" I don't believe that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> approve of some of your

sacrilegious thing. That's how I feel about it ! "
To us, attempting to trace the obscure sources of these
movements the following question seems relevant. What
"mediumistic " instructions were received at that prayer
meeting in Oberlin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to have fanaticised the faithful ?

spring from the same root, namely, the exercise of occult
hypnotic influences over the masses to determine any
movement <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> religious, social or political. That this is
so has been clearly demonstrated in the articles which deal
with the Moravians, Jansenists,

but to be obliged to add
Prohibition to this list comes rather as a shock.
In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the reader may realize that we have a logical
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for putting Prohibition in this category of
extravagances we must stress the point of alcohol being
recognized by occultists as a deterrent to hypnotic influences.

among the masses, must create serious difficulties to such

was in effect opposed to the interests of the Catholic church
(Vatican) the funds of which, in the United States, had been
largely invested in the whisky trust by the Jew Judge, Max
Pam of New Orleans. The Roman Catholic Church, had, by
this act of its agent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> been put in the unhappy political

precipitated by the drastic Prohibition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> as a consequence

One hundred and fifty-one citizens were killed by prohibition

were 77,351 arrests for violations, alleged or real. During the
first year under prohibition there were 29,000 cases instituted,
and during the last fiscal year there were close to 70,000.
Demand for more prisons has been made and new ones
ordered, which it is said will not give relief from overcrowding except for a period of 5 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> or possibly 10. Prison

space forbids. Our chief <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> in including this minor <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span>
among those already mentioned is to show the methods
whereby Communism is rendered palatable to those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

" The American Civil Liberties Union owes its <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> to
the notorious pacifist organizations of war-time fame, which
were presumably financed by German agents in this country

union maintains a staff of speakers, investigators and lawyers
who are working in all sections of the country. Lawyers are
furnished on short notice wherever a radical criminal gets into
trouble. A press clipping service is maintained which keeps
the organization in close touch with every radical criminal or
group of radical criminals in trouble and immediate financial
aid, publicity and counsel is offered. Aiding in this service are
some 800 co-operating lawyers, and more than a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span>
correspondents and investigators, representing 450 weekly
labour, farmer and liberal papers with 420 speakers and
writers.
" The American Civil Liberties Union was particularly

direct contact with the Government.
" The policies of the organization are determined by the
National Committee and the carrying out of them is <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to the
Executive Committee which meets weekly. "
Mr. Whitney quotes the following paragraphs from the
1920 Lusk Committee report concerning the American Civil
Liberties Union :
" An examination, however, of the propaganda and
agitation which has been carried on in favor of the forceful
overthrow of this Government shows that it does not consist
of a mere expression of opinion, but invariably advocates
measures for its effectuation. In other words, the
representatives of revolutionary Socialists, Communists,
Anarchists and other groups, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that by doing certain acts
this Government may be overthrown and in each instance the
agitator urges his hearers or his readers to commit those acts.
It is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> settled principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> that any reasonable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
responsible for the logical and reasonable consequences of
his acts and utterances.
" While the Constitution of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> of New York
guarantees the right of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> speech it also contains the
warning that the citizen may exercise it " being responsible
for the abuse of that right ". The effect of the activities of the
American Civil Liberties Union is to create in the minds of
the ill-informed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> the impression that it is un-American
to interfere with the activities of those who seek to destroy
American institutions. They seek to influence legislators and
executives to repeal or veto any act calculated to protect the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> or the Federal Government from the attacks of
agitators. "
After some further analysis this report says :
" The American Civil Liberties Union, in the last analysis,
is a supporter of all subversive movements, and its
propaganda is detrimental to the interests of

630

the state. It attempts not only to protect crime but to
encourage attacks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> our institutions in every form.
" The union is closely identified with groups in practically
every <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> in the country known as ' parlor Bolsheviki'.
Speakers are furnished for these dilettante radicals <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

that promises them a thrill. It has been said that many idle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
and women become identified with this parlor Bolshevik
movement through emotionalism and because it gives them
something to think about. Whatever the reason, the Communists and the Civil Liberties Union agitators make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of these
groups for financial aid and as means of spreading
propaganda.
" It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known ", as Mr. Whitney further explains, " that
the Workers' party, as a branch of the Communist party, has
access to the ' sucker lists ' of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have contributed to
the finances of the party in various cities, and besides has '

The most remarkable feature of these lists is the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of

(Founded 1920)
The origin of this <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> is given by Mrs. Webster in The
Surrender of an Empire (p. 132) in the following terms :
" The League of Oppressed Peoples had been founded in
the United States under the name of the ' League of Small and
Subject Nationalities ' by Dudley Field Malone, attorney for
Ludwig Martens, who was afterwards appointed Bolshevist
ambassador to the United States by Chicherin. Aleister
Crowley, the well-known Satanist, who was then working in
the United States for Germany, was connected with this
association through one of its agents in America... After the
Armistice the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> became the ' League of Oppressed
Peoples ', a name coined by the Germans who had declared
themselves to be the champions of the numerous oppressed
peoples of the British Empire ".
In the archives of certain Secret Services, there is a report
stating that John Wesley De Kay, having travelled from
Switzerland to Berlin on a German diplomatic passport, had
an interview there with Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, and
four members of the
631

Druidenorden of which the direct outcome was the
foundation in January 1920 of the V. V. V.
This organization was to operate in a subordinate capacity
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known masonic " Druidenorden " and, at a secret
meeting held Jan. 14, 1920, a certain Colonel was elected
President of the Council. At the same meeting, a council of
the League was founded and provision was made for the
headquarters, and representatives in every country. It was
also further decided that only bonafide accredited
representatives in a recognized revolutionary society, with an
occasional " Socialist Humanitarian ", <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be eligible for

quota allotted to each member country.
It was further ordered that a secret Inner Council, the very
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of which was to be ignored by the General Council
and the members of the League, was to be formed. Five
persons composed this secret council of which John De Kay
was the President for life.
The Swiss branch of the <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was founded on the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> as the German by a colleague of De Kay.
" The Druidenorden " writes Mrs. Webster, " was the
concrete expression of the idea... of the ' Eastern School ' of
German Monarchists, who believed in coming to an
understanding with Soviet Russia for the purpose of a war of
revenge against the Allies or, failing this, of undermining
them by revolutionary propaganda, particularly throughout
the British Empire. This section of German Monarchists
never ceased to co-operate with the Bolsheviks after Lenin
and his companions in the sealed train were sent by them to
Russia : and the marvellous organization of Soviet
propaganda abroad has been largely attributable to the
German as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Jewish brains behind it.

group and the Soviet Government were indistinguishable.
Radek — alias Sobelssohn — acted as the link between
Berlin and Moscow. The Druidenorden, like the Komintern,
was internationally organized with lodges in Rome, Milan,
Prague, Budapest and ramifications in England, France,
Holland, Italy, Algeria, Canada, Egypt, India, Vladivostok
and Japan. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> important centres in
Switzerland — at Zurich and Lugano — under Baron von A.

that country by supplying revolutionaries throughout the

pro-German and anti-Entente.
" This inner secret <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> was behind the Moplah risings
in India in 1921, and it was again the Druidenorden that
recruited revolutionary Jews in Germany, and passed them
through Switzerland via Milan and Genoa to Palestine, in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to stir up feeling against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Britain.

" There was also a direct connection between the
Druidenorden and the I. R. B. (Irish Republican Brotherhood)
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> relations with Ireland were principally maintained
through the V. V. V. and its agents in America. "
In 1922 the V. V. V. founded a subsidiary organization : "
The League of Oppressed Peoples of the East, calculated to
coordinate the activities of various societies such as those of "
The Friends of Soviet Russia " and the " Friends of India ".

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
(Founded 1920)
The League of Nations came into being on January 10,
1920, when the Treaty of Versailles, incorporating the first
26 articles of " The Covenant of the League " was ratified.
Cradled in Mazzini's Masonic Young Europe movement,
the League and Treaty are the apotheosis of the policy of the
old International Commitree of London and its satellite
societies.
Of these, Mrs Webster, in her <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> The Surrender of an
Empire, 1 gives us the following epitome :
" It was towards 1850 that a modified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of this scheme
became known as ' The United States of Europe ', The actual
formula seems first to have been <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> publicly by Victor
Hugo in his opening speech to the <span class="t13 hoverable">Peace</span> Congress held in
Paris in 1849, but it was not until some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later that it was
formally adopted as the slogan of International Socialism.
The impulse came again from the masonic lodges. In 1866,
a Freemason named Santallier composed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on Pacifism
for his brother masons which led to the

founding of the Union de la Paix, under the presidency of
another Freemason, a German Jew named Bielefeld. The
movement spread to Switzerland and on September 5, 1867, a
further Congress was held. The proceedings were enlivened
by a duel between the Constitutionalists and the Socialists,
who declared that kings, soldiers — and some added priests
— must be swept away in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to make room for the new
Federation of Republics. The Socialists, led by Emile Acollas,
won the day. Dupont, Karl Marx's right hand, was invited to
represent the First International, of which he was secretary.
Longuet, Marx's son-in-law, also attended. It was finally
decided to found a " League of <span class="t13 hoverable">Peace</span> and Liberty ", with a
Franco-German periodical, entitled Les Etats-Unis de
I'Europe, as its organ. This association, the ' Ligue
Internationale de la Paix et de la Liberte ', still exists and
publishes its paper ".
It is small wonder that members of Fabianism should have
made themselves the heralds of the idea of the League of
Nations. In 1917, Henry Noel Brailsford, helped by Noel
Buxton, a noted Fabian, had <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> A League
of Nations, in which he outlined its principles and eventual
organization. Later, Fabians proudly proclaimed that with the
advent of the Labour Party, which was their party, they had
gained <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> control of the League of Nations. But the most
outspoken statements on its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of internationalism comes
from the pen of one of the Founders of Fabianism, George
Bernard Shaw.
In April, 1929, the Fabian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> published a tract (No.
226) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> The League of Nations, in which the noted author
gives an <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the strange relations which exist between
the members of the respective national governments and
those of the international government of the
League.
Alluding to an incident

which <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Geneva between Mr Locker-Lampson,
Under-Secretary to the British Foreign Office, sent by his
Government and representing it, and Sir Eric Drummond,
permanent Secretary-General of the League at Geneva,
George Bernard Shaw writes :
"These deciduous members arrive mostly in scandalous
ignorance of the obligations already contracted by their
Governments to the permanent governing bodies of the
League. As party <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> they are at the opposite pole to the '

themselves to be advocates of British national interests (not to
say nationalist spies in the international camp) and expect to
be supported devotedly by
their distinguished
fellow-countrymen on the permanent staffs. They are rudely
undeceived the moment they begin their crude attempts at
sabotage.
" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the British Jingo Imperialist finds himself writhing
in the grip of Sir Eric Drummond whilst the French
Poincarist-Militarist takes the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> count in the first round
from Mr Albert Thomas...
" This situation, in which the permanent nominees of the
constituent governments are thrown into resolute opposition
to their deciduous representatives is chronic at Geneva. One
of Mr Albert Thomas's greatest victories there was won over
the French Government when he defeated its attempt to
exclude agricultural workers from the scope of the Labour
Office on the ground that they are not 'industrials'. The really
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> that is happening at Geneva is the growth of a
genuinely international public service, the chiefs of which are
ministers in a coalition which is, in effect, an incipient international Government. In the atmosphere of Geneva
patriotism perishes ; a patriot there is simply a spy who
cannot be shot.
" In short, the League is a school for the new inter-

diplomacy ".
The struggle described by Bernard Shaw as taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at

edifying. The Labour Office, as its offspring, has the blessing
of Fabianism and we are informed that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its
friends it is " quite willing to let the Secretariat die a natural
death. "
How reminiscent of Marxism are all these utterances of
one of the notorious disciples of the School of Destruction!
Another aspect of the League of Nations was given by an
ardent Zionist — Jessie E. Sampter, who wrote that " the
League of Nations is an old Jewish ideal, the ideal of
nationalism and internationalism... The Jewish God-ideal
implies democracy and internationalism ". Further the same
author vouchsafed the information that " the solution of
self-determination and the recognition of the necessity for a
League of Nations to protect small peoples from future
aggression have grown in large measure out of the claims of
Zionists. " 2
We also know that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Robert Cecil, Chairman of the

TENRI
(Founded around 1920)

CXXXII

KENJUKAI

The Tenri Kenjukai, a Japanese politico-religious sect, is
an offshoot of the main cult known as Tenrikyo, itself
dissident from Shintoism, the national religion of Japan.
It is subversive, inasmuch as its adherents <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> mostly to
one of the main tenets of the Japanese religion, namely, the
traditional regard held for the Imperial Family.

BUCHMANISM
(Founded in 1928)

In the spring of 1928 much perturbation was caused in
educational circles by the discovery that Buchmanism, defined by
English University authorities as perverted religious mania, had
permeated men's as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as women's colleges at Oxford.
his, the Oxford undergraduates' weekly, attacked Buchmanism
in its leading article in one of its May issues ot 1928. On May 17,
1928, the Daily Telegraph partly reproduced it in the. following
article :

" In the women's colleges, " declares
the paper, "Buchmanism is procuring the
worst effects attendant on perverted
religious mania. "

" The theory of Buchmanism ", says the leading
article, " we do not presume to judge, but the
effects of its practice we deplore. Buchmanism, on
the surface, is almost painfully innocuous ; its
semi-public meetings are patronised by several

for surplus religious feeling ; and so, no doubt,
they are.
" GIGGLES AND FANATICISM. "
" These meetings, however, have, roughly,
the same relation to Buchman-ism as a dentist's
waiting-room has tc the pain the dentist is about
to inflict. Attendance at several of them is a
preliminary step to admission to a group, a
gathering of perhaps four or five friends, so
delightfully informal that it seems uncharitable
tc <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> it clandestine. Here, in an atmosphere
hovering between giggles and fanaticism,
restraint is flung aside, souls are laid bare by
hysterical confession, and, with a fervour which
no longer pretends to be religious, the tenets of
the doctrine are discussed.
" Now, Buchmanism attributes to
Christianity a four-fold foundation on honesty,
unselfishness, purity and love. It is worthy of
remark that the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> qualilies are seldom
considered worthy ot discussion. Honesty, in
fact, is not a conspicuous feature of these
proceedings, from which the sceptical are
firmly excluded, and in which the perfervid are
virtually hoodwinked.

IN WOMEN'S COLLEGES.
" In the women's colleges, although iu name
of its founder is never mentioned Buchmanism
has firmly established' itself, and is producing
the worst effects attendant on perverted
religious mania One of its adherents has
recently been obliged to leave Oxford. In
several others devotion to the cult is producing
lesults not usually associated with the practice
of Christianity. '1 he authorities appear to be
alarmed but remain apathetic It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
something was done about it.
" Buchmanism is not widespread. Probably,
in Oxford, it never will be! We do not wish to
exaggerate the danger it represents, but neither
do we wish other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to minimise or ignore

THE RACKETS
(Founded 1928)

Racketeering finds a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in this study on Occult
Theocrasy because its adepts are the faithful servants of
Mammon and their methods of terrorism, intimidation,
plunder and murder are analogous to those of the Thugs,
worshippers of Siva. Moreover, according to Fred Pasley,
author of Al Capone and Muscling In, racketeering is
organized and controlled by the members of the Italian
Society, the Unione Sicilione, the Mafia, which he calls an
invisible government.
Racketeering, as a system for plundering legitimate
business, often with the connivance of the police and
government officials, has assumed formidable proportions
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the last few years.
Mr. Fred. D. Pasley, in his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Muscling In, states that "
The Rackets " started with Prohibition in the United States.
In 1928, after Mussolini had suppressed the terrorist
Sicilian <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> known as The Mafia, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> members <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span>

refuge in Chicago, U. S. A. There, through their affiliation
with the Unione Sicilione, later known as the Italo-American
Union, they manoeuvred them645

646

OCCULT THEOCRASY

selves into a position which enabled them to cooperate with
the vice and liquor purveyors of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> on the one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> and
the political party machines on the other.
To quote Mr. Pasley : 1
" The Unione Sicilione had become a $ 10,000,000 a year
enterprise, supplying the basic ingredient for the synthetic
Bourbon, Rye, Scotch, brandy, rum and gin marketed in and
around Chicago, and controlling the sale of sugar to the
affiliated distillers of the West <span class="t6 hoverable">Side</span> Italian district : Melrose
Park, Cicero, and Chicago Heights. "
The <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the Unione, "... ruled locally as a despot over
some 15,000 Sicilians and dominated the councils of the
Unione's branches in St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh,
Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York City. " He was
virtually the chief executive in the invisible government,
administering the gunman dictatorship of Chicago.
In 1928, the organized gunmen ot Chicago seized control
of the Chicago Coal Teamsters', Chauffeurs' and Helpers'
Union, local No. 704, and the Rackets entered a new phase,
that of economic terrorisation by the armed forces of the
Underworld.
In 1931, the New York Times of November 28 drew the
following picture of the gangster situation :
New York <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">City</span> has become the world's capital of the
racketeers, who " with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Tammany hookups,
reinforced with revolver bullets and sawed-off shotgun slugs "
are exacting an annual tribute of at least $ 600,000,000 here,
Fred D. Pasley, biographer of Al Capone, asserts in " Muscling In, " to be published today by Ives Washburn. Every
trade and business organization is racket-ridden, some of the
hardest hit groups being dealers in such foodstuffs as

THE

RACKETS

647

artichokes, flour, milk, fish and ice, the garment trades, the building
industry and the various branches of transportation, the author
declares.
Mr. Pasley's nation-wide survey pays special attention to Chicago
and New York. Crime, he reiterates, has become " big business, "
thoroughly organized in every large American <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> " with its various
racket departments—whether beer, booze, pretzels, gambling, vice
or the muscling in on industry and labor unions—as efficiently
administered as the units of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> corporation. " Instead of
diminishing, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the racketeers is increasing and " in
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York and other
American cities the gangster with his syndicate is in the racket
saddle in 1931 and riding high, wide and handsome. "
In Chicago the annual tribute exacted by racketeers amounts to $
200,000,000, Mr. Pasley says. The levy in Philadelphia is estimated
at $ 100,000,000, in Detroit $ 75,000,000, in Los Angeles $
50,000,000 and in Cleveland and Pittsburgh S 25,000,000 each. The
nation's annual crime bill is put at $ 1,119,000,000.
Asserting that the rise of the racketeer dates from the enactment
of prohibition, Mr. Pasley continues :
" Prohibition after twelve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> is pouring into the coffers of the
Capones, the Maddens, the Gordons and the Duffys something like
$ 3,000,000,000 a year for the financing of their varied enterprises
and the maintaining of political relationships. The <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> laws which
they violated with impunity in their criminal operations were
ineffective against them, for it was the record that the only
convictions obtained, and these at excessive cost, were for
violations of a Federal statutef namely, income tax evasion. "
The author criticizes severely the practice of freeing gangsters on
bail while awaiting trial, contending that this allows the racketeer to
silence his enemies by murder, to bribe officials, and to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his organization to defeat justice in other ways.
But the term " Racketeering " does not apply only to the deeds of
American gangsters.
Besides the underworld vice rings, drug rings, bootleggers and
purveyors to the white slave traffic, we must

648

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

also recognise the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of Economic and Financial
Rackets organized internationally on a huge scale.
To this category belong the International Foreign
Exchange and National Credit Ramps operating to control the
currencies of various countries for the benefit of a few "
Insiders ". Foreign Exchange gambling gains are not even
taxable and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> constitute a doubly valuable racket. A
banker's racket!
The Stock Exchange Racket, whereby the invested
economies of the thrifty are siphoned out of their pockets into
those of the " Insiders " is another popular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of business
ramp. Stolen property being tax exempt, stock frauds yield a
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> return. However we do not advocate taxing stock fraud
profits, we merely suggest that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> should provide for the
punishment of those criminals who operate such transactions.
Then there are the Tax Department, Income and Super Tax
Rackets. Should Racketeers gain control of the machinery of
government of a country and <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> its system of taxation as a
means of extorting and bleeding the taxpayer, such abuses are
none the less a racket! The Income and Super Tax Racket
conduces naturally to the extension of the operations of the
Stock Exchange fraudulent operator. The poor pay the tax.
Sometimes the rich pay it too. In any case, the honest pay for
the dishonest.
And what of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> ? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> often have to wonder,
especially in the U. S. A., <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they can always go to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span>
solely on the basis of a just claim. Must they not sometimes
consider <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they will not be acting through a lawyer
who may have interests which are opposed to their own ? And
if there should be such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as a betrayal, need it always be
paid for in money ?
Again, we must not overlook the Social Racket, one

THE

649

of the most interesting examples of which is the now famous "
Douglas-Pennant <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">Case</span> ". From recent developments,
however, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem that this was largely a Masonic
intrigue. The Chairman of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Lords Committee
trying the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> was the late <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Kintore, a noted Freemason.
Others connected with the conspiracy to ruin Miss Violet
Douglas-Pennant's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and reputation were also Freemasons.
Nothing was ever proved against this lady and she herself
makes no mystery of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that she was, for a short time, a
member of a masonic organization, "The G. D. " She resigned
her membership in this body, however, shortly after her
initiation but from then onward was hounded and threatened
in every way. That her failure to gain Justice in an English
court is only a part of a policy of persecution will surprise few
of those who have followed her case.
The present wave of International Unemployment is
interesting as an Economic Racket. Already France, England
and the U. S. A. have been led to segregate their own workers
and exclude foreign labour. This course seemed a patriotic
necessity at the outset but the idea, exploited to its logical
conclusion, spells slavery of the workers. Nations decreeing
that only native labour can be employed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> their

where it commands the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> price and best conditions.
Labour, robbed of its right to control its own market, may
suddenly <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> itself restricted to even county boundaries. In
that event a condition will arise for which there is already an
historical precedent. Boris Goudounoff, through the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
of just such a situation in Russia, instituted serfdom in a

The Rackets are the last stage of the battle in the economic
war between Predatory Capitalism and Predatory Labour
against Constructive Capitalism and Constructive Labour.
The progressive stages of this war are outlined in a document

significance of this record should have been made the subject
of a comprehensive course of studies in every school, church

This <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> was founded on April 5, 1930, at a meeting at

Professor Einstein and Arthur Henderson which

In Torchbearers (p. 32), a pamphlet published by The New

THE YOUTH <span class="t13 hoverable">PEACE</span> FEDERATION
(Founded 1930)
Early in the 20th Century the headquarters of The Worker,
the Communist weekly, were at 8 East 10th Street, New
York. It also harboured a " Youth Movement " imported
from Germany.
In a pamphlet issued by the Massachusetts Public Interest
League, (210 Newbury Street, Boston, Mass. April 1925) we
read that this " Youth Movement " was sponsored by The
National Student Forum, an organization " made up of those
elements in the colleges which have at different times <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
themselves Inter-collegiate Socialist Societies, Liberal
Leagues and Leagues for Industrial Democracy. It was
Lenin's cleverness which suggested ' frequent changes of
name ' to radical organizations. This bewilders the public and
the new names serve as an alias. "
An article in the Survey Graphic for December 1921 stated
the aims of this movement to include advocation of the
Nudity Cult and promiscuity in sex relationships under the
name of <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> love. Its advocacy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Body</span> worship enables us to
classify it as " Phallic ".
" It is the purpose of the National Student Forum ", writes
R. M. Whitney, in a pamphlet entitled The

In the New Student, the organ of the National Student
Forum of Dec. 2nd, 1922, Mr. George Bernard Shaw is
quoted as saying; — "As far as I can gather, if the students in
American Universities do not organize their own education,
they will not get any. The professors are overworked
schoolmasters, underpaid, and deprived of all liberty of
speech and conscience. From them nothing can be expected...
the remedy is cooperative organization by the consumers; that
is, by the students... In forming intellectual Soviets, and
establishing the Dictatorship of the Learner, the American
students may save their country, if it is capable of being saved.
If not, they will at least learn something, and perhaps teach
something, in the ecstasy of demolition. "
In a speech made in Moscow in June, 1923, Zinovieff
(Chairman of The Young Communist International
Movement) said : — " The Youth Movement is the best
section of the Communist International. " 3
In further corroboration of the tendencies of this
organisation to an " ecstasy of demolition ", Professor George
Leiken of the Volga region is further mentioned in the
pamphlet above referred to as saying : — " When the Russian
youth reaches the age of 12 the so-called League of
Communist Youth awaits him. This

THE INTERNATIONAL BANK
(Founded 1930)
The Internationalization of finance reached its apotheosis
when, on April 23 1930 the International Bank at Basle,
commissioned to enrol the central banks of nine nations in its
membership, was founded.
As for the delegates from the different countries attending
the meeting their names signify little for, owing to the speed
and unanimity with which official appointments were made,
it is evident that they were all instructed, or, in other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
pledged, to obey orders. By whom were the orders given ?
History may answer that question some day!
Mr. Gates McGarrah was elected chairman of the board of
directors with Mr. Leon Frazer his deputy and Sir Charles
Addis and Dr. Melchior were elected vice-chairmen.
The significance of this international institution was
commented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> in an article entitled " Mammon being

" One is amazed at the equanimity with which Sir Charles
Addis describes the difficulty of enabling

the Bank for International Settlements to avoid interference
with the Sovereign Rights of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of each of so many
countries ! Surely the possibility alone ought to be adequate
condemnation of the bank. The opening for chicanery, brute
force, bribery, corruption and war, in the supposed solution
of this problem,
is unprecedented in the history of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> .............

immune from seizure, confiscation, and censorship, in <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span>
or war ; it is also to be subject to no restriction or prohibition
of any kind on its imports and exports of gold or currency. So
little do Government decisions regarding the Bank really
count that, before the scheme has been sanctioned, the first
part of the subscription has already been subscribed . The
Bankers and business <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to be associated are to ensure that
there will be no uncertainty about the business that the Bank
will promote, the ' money troubles which lie at the root' of the
industrial depression and financial uncertainty are, of course,
going to be cured by them — so they say. The Governor of the
Bank of England (Mr Montagu Norman) is going to be a
director of this foreign Bank. What an honour ! This Board,
with the daily lives of hundreds of millions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> at its
mercy, is going to meet at least ten times a year — four times
at Basle... 'The Bank owes allegiance to no single
Government. ' It need keep no currency reserve...
"This Bank that owes no allegiance to anyone can do as it
likes,.... Mammon is enthroned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the world, to make what

and necessary, for it is a proven <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that candidates to
parliament in one country have sometimes been controlled by
a man, or group of men, in another country inimical to their
own.
If political control is international it must of necessity be
subversive of PATRIOTISM. If it holds in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> the reckless

must be subversive of Christianity and Religion. If it directs
vice rings of all kinds, it must aim at the destruction of the
moral, intellectual and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> strength of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> Race.
If, in conclusion, Finance is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> and as such is

instilling into them the super religion of the secret.
It is against this " secret " that the fight should be waged. If
the aims of secret societies are good, one fails to see the need
for their secret oaths and initiations. The "light " they promise
should, like the sun, shine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> everyone.

all material wants, but to his amusement, so that his declining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all
Brethren with whom he is acquainted, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> by entertainment or
conversation, or in any other manner that may suggest itself. It will
frequently and naturally arise that <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> itself springs up between
members of the Order, for that they have so many and so sacred
interests in common. Such <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> is peculiarly holy, and is to be
encouraged.

All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> of Brethren arc to be considered as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> of

members severally, as by its organization collectively. No
distinction is to be made with regard to the conditions surrounding
the birth of any child.
15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother
should fulfil, with regard to all children, those <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the

This duty is to instruct them in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Thelema,
to teach them independence and freedom of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and character,
and to warn them that servility and cowardice are the most deadly
diseases of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> soul.

16. Personal or domestic attendants should be chosen from
among the members of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> when possible, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> tact and
courtesy are to be employed in dealing with them.
17. They, on their part, will render willing and intelligent
service.
18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be
treated as Brothers, with perfect equality ; such beha-

viour is undesirable during the hours of service, and familiarity,
subversive as it is of all discipline and order, is to be avoided by
adopting a complete and marked change of manner and address.
19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not
to the Brethren Servient in the Profess-Houses of the Order, who,
giving service <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> recompense, are to be honoured as hosts.
20. In <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all
Brethren who know him personally to attend him, to see that he
want for nothing, and to report if necessary his needs to the Lodge,
or to Grand Lodge itself.
21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will
naturally give their skill and care with even more than their
customary joy in service.
22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service in
their particular trade, business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge.
For example, a stationer will supply the Grand Lodge with paper,
vellum, and the like ; a bookseller offer any books to the Library of
Grand Lodge which the Librarian may <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to possess ; a lawyer
will execute any legal business for Grand Lodge, and a railway or
steamship owner or director see to it that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Officers travel in
comfort wherever they may wish to go.
23. Visitors from other Lodges are to be accorded the treatment
of ambassadors ; this will apply most especially to Sovereign Grand
Inspectors General of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> on their tours of inspection. All
hospitality and courtesy shown to such is shown to Ourselves, not to
them only.

24. It is desirable that the marriage partner of any Brother should
also be a member of the Order. Neglect to insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this leads
frequently to serious trouble for both parties, especially for the
uninitiate.

referred to in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> part of this instruction.
26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to
the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> or Masters of their Lodge or Lodges in conference ; if a
composition be not arrived at in this manner, the dispute is to be
referred to the Grand Tribunal, which will arbitrate thereon, and its
decision is to be accepted as final.
27. Refusal to apply for or to accept such decision shall entail
expulsion from the Order, and the other party is then at liberty to
seek his redress in the Courts of Profane Justice.
28. Members of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> are to regard those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its pale as

should be made to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> them into Freedom.

is he to be compelled to surrender it ? Such cases of difficulty
involve deep philosophical principles ; and the Areopagus of the

" Of the Eleventh Degree, its powers, privileges, and qualifications, nothing whatever is said in any grade. It has no relation

property, earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the
Grand Treasurer General. The members subsist on the charity of the
Order, which is extended to them in accordance with their original
rank in life.
