To this testify the recorded traditions ascribed to the lights that have emanated from the Day-star of Truth, the essence of the Prophet Muhammad.

Moreover, in the traditions the terms "sun" and "moon" have been applied to prayer and fasting, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as it is said: "Fasting is illumination, prayer is light." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> day, a well-known <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to visit Us.

And now, to resume Our argument concerning the question: Why is it that the sovereignty of the Qa’im, affirmed in the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of recorded traditions, and handed down by the shining stars of the Muhammadan Dispensation, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> not in the least been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> manifest?

Yea, the sovereignty attributed to the Qa’im and spoken of in the scriptures, is a reality, the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of which none can doubt. This sovereignty, however, is not the sovereignty which the minds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have falsely imagined.
