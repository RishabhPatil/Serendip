F.

AN EXPLANATION OF THE HERACLEID, OR OF THE SACRED
POEM ON THE TWELVE MONTHS AND ON THE SUN,
WORSHIPPED UNDER THE NAME OF HERCULES.

THE following comparison of the legend of Hercules
with the constellations which preside over the twelve
months

is

from Dupuis.

(See Origin of All Religions, pp.

87-93-)

Whatever may have been the opinions about Hercules,
he was surely not a petty Grecian prince, renowned for his
romantic adventures. It is the mighty luminary, which
animates and

fructifies

the universe, the divinity which

has been honored everywhere by the erection of temples
and altars, and consecrated in religious song by all nations.

regular succession the seasons, which renew and reproduce
themselves, are so many traits of the Sun, that we should

recognize them even if the poet had not given to his Hercules the name of Helios, or the Sun.
The author of the hymns which are attributed to Or-

pheus describes in the most precise manner the affinity,
or rather the identity, of Hercules with the Sun.
The
Phoenicians have consequently preserved the tradition that
Hercules was the Sun-god, and that his twelve labors

represented the journey of this luminary through the
twelve signs of the zodiac. Porphyrius, <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in Phoenicia,
makes the same assertion.

"The Egyptians," says Plutarch, "thought that Hercules
had his seat in the Sun, and that he travelled with it
around the world." The scholiast of Hesiod tells us also
"that the zodiac, in which the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> accomplishes its annual course, is the real career which Hercules travels over
in the fable of the twelve labors, and that by his
marriage
with Hebe, the goddess of youth, we must understand
the year which renews itself at the end of each revolution."

It is

evident that

if

Hercules

is

the Sun, as

is

shown by

the above-cited authorities, the fable of the twelve labors
is a solar fable which can have reference
only to the twelve
months and to the twelve signs, of which the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> travels

over one in each month.

This inference shall become a
demonstration by the comparison which we shall make of
each of the labors with each one of the months, or with
the signs and constellations which mark the division of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the heavens during each of the months.

Amongst the different epochs at which formerly the year
began, that of the summer solstice was one of the most
remarkable. It was on the return of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> to this point
