Notes:
INTRODUCTION
Scope of the Work. This <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> is the revised and
much enlarged edition of my Zoroastrian Theology,
which has been out of print for the past fifteen years.
The publication of my Zoroastrian Civilization, and Our
Perfecting World, Zarathushtra's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Way</span> of Life, and
professional duties have delayed the completion of
the work. I have inserted new material in several
chapters and added nineteen new chapters to the
book. I have given a concise <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the religious
beliefs and practices prevalent among the
Zoroastrians and their early Iranian ancestors from
the pre-Gathic times to the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and named
the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> History of Zoroastrianism.
Arrangement and method. I have divided the entire
period of the history of Zoroastrianism on the
linguistic basis. The earliest Zoroastrian documents
are the Gathas, <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the Gathic dialect. They
represent the earliest phase of the religion of
Zoroaster. But <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Iran had a religion which
preceded Zoroastrianism in point of time. I have
labelled this period pre-Gathic; for its beginning is
lost in remote antiquity, and the advent of Zoroaster
brings its end.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Zoroaster flourished is a moot
question. The approximate date at which he lived is
1000 B.C. Zoroaster revolutionizes the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of the Iranians, which hitherto represented the
evolutionary phase of religion. It was the movement
in which we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> creeping for

ages to rise from the lower to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> level. To put
this in another way, the pre-Gathic religion of Iran is
the evolution of the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
and many ages; Zoroaster's is the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
and one age. The prophet of Iran establishes a new
religion. In the pre-Gathic religion the trend of
religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> struggles from the complex to the
simple, from concrete to abstract, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the
farthest removed from the ideal stage.
Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, as preached in the
Gathas is the very embodiment of the simple and the
abstract. It is the realization [xxxii] of the ideal. It is
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> to which the coming generations have to
conform. Deviation from it means a fall, a
degeneration of the religous life. This <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> period I
have termed Gathic.
Decay soon begins in the language in which
Zoroaster composed his immortal hymns, and his
successors now write in the Avestan dialect, which
replaces the Gathic. The Avestan language remains
the <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> language of the Zoroastrians from now
onward to probably the last <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the Parthians,
when the Pahlavi language becomes the court
language of the Sasanians and supersedes the
Avestan. The most extensive literature on
Zoroastrianism is <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in Avestan. This period,
which I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Later Avestan period, extends to
the early part of the Pahlavi era and goes even
beyond it. When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> periods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> overlap each
other, it often becomes difficult to determine
<span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> a certain phase of religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is on
one side or the other of the dividing line between
them. The Avestan works, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in which they
were <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the Avestan period, no longer exist.
They were scattered by the storm that swept over

Persia when Alexander conquered the country, and
shook her religious edifice to its base. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in
which the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> have reached us is that
which was given them during the Pahlavi period. The
artists employed to restore the broken edifice belong
to the Pahlavi period, but the materials <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> come
down from the Avestan sources.
The Pahlavi period ranks fourth in the arrangement
of the present work, and it covers a period of about
eight centuries. Although it is most productive under
the Sasanian rule, it does not close with the collapse
of this, the last of the Zoroastrian empires, but
survives it by at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries in Moslem

some of the most important of the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> are

Thus, the Pahlavi Bundahishn is the epitome of the
Avestan Damdat [Damdad] Nask, which is subsequently
lost. Similarly, not a few of the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>

the Arabs tenaciously preserve the tradition handed
down by Sasanian Persia. These are characterized by

writer's times. The Menuk-i Khrat, for example, betrays
Moslem influence when it preaches fatalism, but is
otherwise faithfully voicing the sentiments of the
orthodox Sasanian Church. This interweaving of old
ideas with the new ones, and the interpolations and
additions of the later writers in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of earlier
generations, often make it hopeless to disentangle the
complications and distinguish between the opinions

and ideas of different periods.
Thirteen hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> have elapsed since the
dissolution of the last of the Zoroastrian empires.
Henceforth we have to record the religious history of
the Zoroastrian remnants in Persia and the
Zoroastrian settlers of India. Zoroastrianism sinks
with the Zoroastrian power, and a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> period of
obscurity follows. I have named it a period of
decadence.
Under the aegis of the British rule in India
Zoroastrianism emerges once again with the
prosperity of the Parsi community. I have hailed this
as the period of the revival of Zoroastrianism.
These various periods, which represent
chronologically different stages of the historical
development of the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of Iran, from
remote antiquity down to the immediate present,
will, I hope, give the reader a general and
comprehensive <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of the history of Zoroastrian
religion. As the subjects are treated piece-meal in
different periods according to the natural growth of
ideas from period to period, the reader will have to
read crosswise when he needs a complete <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
any particular concept. For example, if he wants to
know all that the Zoroastrian literature has to say
about Ormazd [Ohrmazd], he will get it as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
not from any one period, but from all. The detailed
list of contents and the index will help him in his
inquiry.
Transliteration of the technical terms. I have sought
to preserve the changes that these have undergone
during successive periods, and have variously
transliterated them in the treatment of the different

periods, according as they represent the Avestan,
Pahlavi, or Persian pronunciations. Thus, for
example, Ahura Mazda of the Gathic and Avestan
periods become Ormazd [Ohrmazd] in the Pahlavi
period. Angra Mainyu assumes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Ahriman in
the subsequent periods. The Avestan Vohu Manah
changes into Pahlavi Vohuman and into Bahman in
Persian. In the frequent <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the name of the
prophet, I have, however, not scrupulously followed
this method. I have distinguished between the
Avestan, [xxxiv] Pahlavi, and Persian forms by
writing Zarathushtra for the first, and Zaratusht for
Pahlavi and Zartusht [Zartosht] for Persian as they
actually occur in these languages; but I have adopted
the more familiar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Zoroaster for general use.
Similarly, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the religion of the prophet
Zoroastrianism. With a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to simplicity for the
general reader, I have avoided, as far as it has been
practicable, the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of diacritical marks, and have
employed simple transcriptions of the names of the
heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> persons, and books when they occur
in the text.

THE SOURCES
The data of information. The materials that we
gather for the preparation of the history of the
religion that Zarathushtra preached in <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> Iran
come from varied sources. The earliest native records
are embodied in the sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in which the
prophet and his immediate disciples propounded the
new religion. These are furnished by the Avestan
literature, which is followed by the Pahlavi and
Pazend [Pazand] <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> and finally by the writings in
Modern Persian down to the end of the eighteenth
century.
Peoples of diverse faiths and nationalities have
likewise, <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> about Zoroaster and his teachings
from the earliest to the modern times. Greeks and
Romans and Christians in the Occident and Indians,
Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Armenians, and Chinese in
the Orient have contributed to the fund of
information on the subject. Zarathushtra has founded
a new religion and we shall begin with the
consideration of the materials <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the foundation,
which are to be gleaned from the Avesta, the earliest
literature produced by Iran.
The Avestan Nasks. Tradition credits Zarathushtra
with having <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> profusely. Pliny states that the

other copy, tradition maintains, was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the
conquering hordes to their own country, where it was
rendered into Greek.5
The collection of the scattered <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> was begun under
the last of the Arsacids and completed in the early
Sasanian period. The twenty-one original Avestan
Nasks were artificially made to correspond to the
twenty-one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Ahuna Vairya formula. The

or devotional hymns, the Hadha Mansarik, which as
Dinkard [Denkard]6 says, is intermediary between the
Gathik and the last division, namely the Datik, which
is that pertaining to law.7 It is estimated that the

The Pahlavi, Pazend, and Persian sources. During
the chaos that prevailed in Iran after the downfall of
the Achaemenian empire, the Avestan language
began to decay. When it grew unintelligible to the
people, the learned priests undertook translations and
explanations of the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> into Pahlavi, [5] the
new language which originated during the period.
These commentaries on the original Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are

explanatory <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> now came to be known as Avastaku Zand or the Avesta and the commentaries. Pahlavi
was the court language of the Sasanians and it
survived the downfall of their empire by at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

[Denkard], for example, was commenced by the
learned high-priest Atarfarnbarg Farokhzad in the
beginning of the ninth century and completed by one
of his successors, Adarbad Hemed, towards the end
of the ninth century. The Dinkard [Denkard], Vijirkard-i
Dinik, and the Persian Rivayets give us summaries of the
lost Nasks. We gather from the contents of the lost
Nasks given in the Dinkard [Denkard] that, with the
exception of the eleventh Nask, altogether twenty

Avestan Nasks, nineteen along with their Pahlavi
commentaries and one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it, still existed in the

under the barbarous rule of the Tartars. Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span>
on religious subjects that are extant consist of about
446,000 words.10
With the invention of the modern Persian alphabet,
Pahlavi fell into the background. An admixture of
Aryan and Semitic make-up the Pahlavi language as
written. It was later simplified by the elimination of
all Semitic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and replacing them with their
Iranian equivalents. The original Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> were
explained and interpreted by the Pahlavi commentary
which, as we saw, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zand. A further need

Parsi-Sanskrit and Gujarati sources. An Indian

parts of the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> into Sanskrit from their
Pahlavi version. Besides these, they have <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> for us
the Sanskrit translation of a few Pahlavi works.
A considerable literature, in prose and verse, has
appeared in Gujarati on Zoroastrian subjeccts in
India. A Gujarati version of the Yasna and Vendidad

There are, likewise, scattered passages in the Vedas,

Iranians and their religion. Judaism under the Exile
was influenced by Zoroastrian teachings and

had gone. But the deeply cherished name Airyanavaejah had been indelibly imprinted on their minds.
The veneration for the stem-land lived, the memory
of its paradisaic condition still lingered, the
auspicious name Airyana-vaejah continued still to be
passionately loved, and the Iranians resolved that
their latest settlement should be known for ever by
no other name than Airyana vaejah of happy
memory.

ZARATHUSHTRA
Zarathushtra doubts to know. Prophets are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> in
the flesh, and Zarathushtra, the prophet of Iran, was
such a man-god. His date of birth, as we shall see in
subsequent chapters, is placed anywhere between 600
B.C. and 6000 B.C. It is an uncontested <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that
there is a marked closeness between the grammar,
metre, and style of the Rig Veda and the Gathas. The
Gathic inflexions are more primitive than the Vedic.
The period of the position of the Gathas, therefore,
cannot be separated from the Vedas by any
considerable distance of time. Zarathushtra's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
birth is of equal uncertainty. His earliest appearance
in the Gathas is at the period of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> when he has
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> his pupilage behind. He has evidently learnt all
he could from what the teachers of his <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> could
give him. He has conversed with the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of his
country. He has often visited the central places
where trade routes from distant lands converged and
has gathered information and experience from the
worldly-wise travellers, merchants, and pilgrims. But

the more he has learnt, the more eager his <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
learn further has grown. His teachers had instructed
him in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> based on tradition. But tradition is
stagnant, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is ever on the onward move.
Besides, tradition is wedded to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that is dead,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> looks to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
end. Moreover, tradition demands its instruction to
be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> on trust, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is based on inquiry
and discussion. <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Reason</span> is shadowed by doubt and
doubt is the parent of knowledge. Zarathushtra, a
paragon of reason, doubts the <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of his teachers.
Zarathushtra resolves to be his own teacher, and to
learn by observation and thinking. He thinks and
thinks deeply and comprehensively on the conditions
prevailing around him. He considers that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is not
woven of the tissues of joy and happiness alone, but
of considerable sorrow and misery also. Injustice and
inequity, strife and oppression, poverty and
destitution, greed [14] and avarice, wrath and rapine,
falsehood and deceit, envy and malice, hatred and
jealousy, crime and vice, sorrow and suffering, filth
and disease confront him everywhere. He is keenly
responsive to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> sufferings and the groans and
sighs of the agonized hearts. The misery of the
multitude touches his heart. His <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> creeps, his
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> is heavily oppressed, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is depressed
at the sight of this dark side of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> life. He suffers
at the sight of suffering and, with <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> suffused with
tears, he lives from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> thinking and
brooding over the woes of the world. Zarathushtra
doubts the goodness of gods.
He is religious at heart, but his daily experience of
the religion practised and lived around him tends to
estrange him from the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of his forefathers. He sees
with horror temples reeking with the blood of

sacrifical animals. He finds that barren formalism,
sanctimonious scrupulosity, meticulous ablutions,
superstitious fear, and display of external holiness
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> for religion. Zarathushtra doubts the religion of
his birth.
Zarathushtra seeks silent, solitary seclusion.
Solitude is nature's sublime temple where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> can
commune with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in the surrounding silence and
unruffled calm. Mountains lift their heads
majestically on the Iranian plateau, and Zarathushtra
retreated into the mountain fastness. Here, far
removed from the stress and strife of life, and with no
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> sound to distract his thoughts, he made his
home. He breathed the refreshing air. The twittering
and chirping and whistling and singing of birds filled
the air. Here the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and waters, birds and beasts,
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon, stars and planets worked as his
teachers. He read some lesson, some message <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span>
by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of the maker of all on every pebble and
every leaf, every dewdrop and every sunbeam, in
every star and every planet. Here he plunged into a
reverie or gazed into vacancy. The calm atmosphere
is conducive to communion, and here, in the
monastic void; he communed with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> which
inspired solemn thoughts in him. He communed with
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and he communed with his inner self. He
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and he reasoned, he cogitated and he
contemplated, he mused and he dreamed. He
meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the essence of divinity, the anomalies

<span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> could not see. Here in the sublime sanctuary
spoke the solemn voice of [15] the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vicar and
he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> it. Zarathushtra's creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> evolved the

highest conception of godhead, whom he named
Ahura Mazda or the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">Wise</span> Lord.
Zarathushtra yearns to see Ahura Mazda.
Zarathushtra has prepared himself through the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span>
discipline of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of

doubts on many points,11 and who but Mazda can

righteousness, to assuage the sufferings of humanity,
to establish a new social order, and to found a new

But the messenger of Mazda is determined to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span>
them and overcome them and emerge triumphant in
the end. He tells Mazda that he will lead mankind on
the path of righteousness and sing untiringly his
praise all around as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> with

of a universal religion. He is convinced that the
religion that Ahura Mazda has commissioned him to
preach is the best for all mankind.36 He looks forward
to winning all living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> for the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Ahura
Mazda.37
But the ardent <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> of the prophet was not to be
fulfilled [18] at the moment, nor to be accomplished
in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> measure in after ages. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> possessed of all

Zoroastrianism has never shown any signs of
becoming a universal religion. In the midst of the
vicissitudes of fortune, it has been a national religion
at best. Little short of a miracle has saved it from
total extinction, and various causes have combined to
reduce it to the narrowest limits today as the
communal religion of a hundred and twenty-five

thousand souls. This <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> will be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out more
prominently in the treatment of the religious

turned his steps to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of birth and childhood.
His kinsfolk and friends recognized him and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they
were bewildered to witness a marvellous change in
him. He was of course grown in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> and stature. But
there was something indescribable that those who
saw him could not realize. His <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> had grown sweet
and serene. It breathed ineffable kindness and bore
shining reflection of his pure inner life. It wore the
expression of gentleness and cheerfulness, hope and
confidence. A resplendent halo of righteousness
encircled his magnetic face. He moved among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

moral grandeur struck awe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> those who came near
him. The sublimity of his serene behaviour, the
childlike simplicity of his speech, the unassuming
attitude of his movements, the imperturbable calm
and passive countenance aroused feelings of
reverence in those who met him. They greeted him
with salutations and adoration. His advent soon
became the event of surrounding villages. All eagerly
pointed to him and talked abour him. In dumb
veneration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> gazed at him, admired him, adored
him, and marvelled at him. He was Zarathushtra of
the Spitamas, they said, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he was altogether a novel
personality. He was of them and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> above them, he
was akin to them and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> unlike them. He spoke
unheard of words, he talked of unknown things. He
was what they were not. They were but men, he was
greater than man, he was an angel, he was a godling.
Zarathushtra definitely breaks with the religion of
his forefathers. Zarathushtra has seen by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

hear what he had to say. He now began to give
lengthy talks on subjects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance to his
eager listeners. He saw that he could sway and draw
the [19] hearts of his hearers to himself. He gave
forth publicly that he came from his maker Ahura
Mazda, whom he declared to be incomparably
greater than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> they had so far known. This

preach a nobler religion than the one they followed.

observances and carried rules for rituals to meticulous
casuistry. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> were fond of sacrificial offerings
of animals and birds. Religion, preached

and <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> and end of the religion that Mazda had
commissioned him to teach was righteous conduct.
His <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> was founded on righteousness. Genuine
piety is of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and its outward expressions are

The
beliefs and practices of his hearers were
irreconcilably alien from what he taught. His
outspoken utterances created diverse effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
those who flocked to hear him daily. Some felt
themselves moved and influenced by them.
There were others among his hearers who had
approached him specially with the intention of
finding out his views <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> rousing his attention to
their ill-will. They <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> alarming reports to their
associates. They saw danger ahead of them. They

adroitly prepared themselves to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> the ominous
situation; and they had not to be <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> in waiting.
Signs of disapprobation, whispers of disapproval,
murmurs of indignation now appeared in various
threatened to break out in open revolt.
The hostile Daevayasnian priests. The priests of the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> were now alarmed. They attempted to
dissuade the prophet from disturbing the peace of the
people. They met often to argue with him on the
questions he was raising, but were foiled in the
controversies.38 They felt themselves humiliated
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and gave up meeting the prophet.
They began to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> against him and tried in all

their guidance. They were renowned as exorcists who

cast out demons, who read dreams, prognosticated
the future, warded off the effect of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> eye and,

with ingenious charlatanism, had prospered among
the credulous and superstitious. Zarathushtra
reproved their greed and avarice. He exhorted the

warned them that they were causing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> harm by
following such false teachers.39 His denunciation of
their practices made them furious and now they
sought his ruin. They accused him of preaching
doctrines that were subversive of the religion of their
forefathers and the established <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of worship, and
of blaspheming their gods. They incited the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

this honoured title.40 In the Gathas the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is

dynasty is known as the Kavi or Kianian [Kayanian].
Its renowned kings who lived before the coming of
Zarathushtra were Kavi Kavata, Kavi Usa, and Kavi
Haosrava. Even Vishtaspa, who later became the
royal patron of the new religion, retains this title and
Zarathushtra speaks of him as Kavi Vishtaspa.41 It is
significant, however, that Vishtaspa is the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
who shares this epithet with his royal predecessors.
The kings who succeed him and with whom the
dynasty dies out do not share the title. To the class of
the Kavi belong the Karapan, corresponding to Skt.
kalpa, 'ritual,' and the Usij, Skt. ushijah.

down their evil.45 The bitterest foe of Zarathushtra
who opposes him and thwarts his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is Bendva,

The Kavis and Karapans carried on vehement counter
propaganda against Zarathushtra. They persuaded,
denounced, cajoled, flattered, and threatened in one
breath those that showed signs of being influenced
by the new doctrines. They terrorized them with
excommunication from society, and with persecution
in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and tortures awaiting them in the next life.

so completely by the new teachings as to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span>
persecution. The history of religions teaches us that a
new religion does not spread through well-balanced
and reasoned arguments and convictions. It is borne
on the wings of the unbounded enthusiasm and
overflowing emotion that a prophet can create. If a
prophet succeeds in preaching the new ideas that fill
his being, with passionate and frantic zeal, if he
succeeds in kindling the flame of emotional, nervous
enthusiasm among his hearers by his fervent
preaching, if he succeeds by means of his whirlwind
campaign to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> the spark that can <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

Zarathushtra's teachings had not so effectively stirred
them. Consequently, those that followed him

between the charms of the new and the dictares of
the old religion, deserted him. The ignorant and
unthinking people, who had, with child-like
curiosity, turned wherever his footsteps trod, imitated
the elders of <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> him. Those who were
proud to claim him as their friend forsook him when
the hour came for them to stand by him. Those that
were his kith and kin disowned him, because he had
disavowed their ancestral faith. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> did the
wavering, timid, half-hearted followers fail him in his
hour of need and leave him. Ahura Mazda alone did
not leave him and, [23] with him on his side,
Zarathushtra felt that he was not alone in his
loneliness. His prestige, however, is shattered and all
restraint is broken. Respect for him is gone. He is
now greeted everywhere with hostile feelings and
coarse jokes. The mob that was hilarious in his
commendation becomes furious in his condemnation.
It mocks and maligns, jeers and insults him.

inequities were formidable. He was the messenger of
Ahura Mazda, the refuge of the weak, the solace of
the suffering, the hope of humanity, and the

moved by his devotion to him that he spoke and sang
of him as the most powerful and the most beautiful
god. Consequently, a monotheistic vein began to
appear in the utterances of sectarians, each of whom
acclaimed his respective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> as the one and the only

the visible disk of the sun. In his zeal for reform, he
changed his own name to Akhenaten or 'pleasing to
the Sun-disk.' He suppressed the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of other
gods, destroyed their statues, demolished the temples
that housed them, sequestered their property and

obliterated their names wherever they appeared. He
consecrated temples to Aten and made the cult of the
Sun-disk his <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> religion and commanded his
subjects to offer their devotions to this one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>

inscrutable creator, one God, absolute in power. The
revolutionary reform, however, did not survive the

AHURA MAZDA
Ahura Mazda is the name Zarathushtra gives to
God. The Iranians, as we shall see later, had <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
to their new homeland several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the IndoIranian pantheon. Zarathushtra does not mention
them by name in his hymns. This omission is not
accidental; it is deliberate. His is altogether a new
religion. No wonder he tells his hearers that he
speaks to them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> that are unheard of before.1 All
thinking and doing, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> or divine, is
done through the mind. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span>
which creates, moulds, and guides anything and
everything. He, therefore, clothes the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of
godhead with <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> and names him 'Ahura Mazda.'
This collocation means literally, 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> Wisdom'
or 'The <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">Wise</span> Lord.' The first element of this
compound, Ahura, 'Lord,' is one of the Indo-Iranian

<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> level and acquired <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> epithets. Ahura
Mazda was never a nature-god. He was what he ever
is, the highly <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> being. Apart from its <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> in the
Gathas, the term Mazda is found in its derivative

B.C. in the Assyrian inscriptions of Sargon.
Moreover, the compound Ahura Mazda itself is found
in its Assyrian equivalent Assara Mazas in an
inscription of Assurbanipal. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the inscription

Zarathushtra uses the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> name variously as the

metrical composition of the hymns requires. He
employs the combinations Ahura Mazda and Mazda

designating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in all cases. In many instances the
[31] terms Ahura and Mazda are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> separately in a
single strophe, the one at the opening and the other
at the close with different exhortations and prayers to
each, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in both cases as applied to the Supreme

SPENTA MAINYU
Spenta Mainyu is the self-revealing activity of
Ahura Mazda. The supreme godhead, we have seen,
is immutable, perfect, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> unity. Zarathushtra
solves the problem of reconciling the unchangeable

postulating a principle that intervenes between the
unmoved mover and the moved. This working
medium of Ahura Mazda spans the chasm between
the supersensuous and the sensuous. He brings the
transcendence and immanence of Ahura Mazda into a
synthesis. Ahura Mazda is neither completely
separated nor completely merged in the world. He is
the primordial, self-existing being. In his infinite
goodness he wills the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the universe. Both
heavenly and earthly existence lived with him and in
him as idealized contents of his being. The

image, his replica. He represents the creative
attribute of Ahura Mazda in his relation to the
created world.
Spenta Mainyu symbolizes the ideal or perfect

by his inseparable opposite. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> primeval

before mankind six cardinal virtues of Ahura Mazda

etherealized moral concepts, symbolic ideals, abstract
figures. They have no individuality, no

As the process towards the personification of Ahura

abstract nouns designating certain virtues in
application to Ahura Mazda himself or to man.

when they have fully grown into Ahura Mazda's
ministering angels is the twofold character of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

guardianship on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> side. This <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

hierarchy, but adapted the legend of the immolation
of the Primeval Bull by Mithra to ethical ends.294

Prayer is the heavenward soaring of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> on

feared. He humbled and humiliated himself before
them, and strove to placate and mollify them. His
more enlightened descendants began worshipping
goodness or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or righteousness in gods.
Prayer in its origin is instinctive and it gradually
grows rational and moral. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has always wearied

that fortune may drop from the skies. He has fancied

expected that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> should answer all his prayers. His
mental and moral progress has purified prayer.
Naturally, he prays for his health and vigour of body,
for <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and riches, for offspring and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> life. In his
nobler mood, he prays for purity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and heart.
He prays that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> may strengthen him to fight
temptation, vice, and sin. When he falters and falls,
he feels contrition for his misdeeds, strips his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span>

transgressions.

happy turn in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and prays not, or, if he
prays he prays with his lips what he disowns with his
heart. Some sorrow, some disaster throws him again

on his knees. When darkness and gloom hang heavily
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, when he is plunged into deep dejection,
when he is cast down by the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of his utter
helplessness, when he thinks the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is giving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

With uplifted <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> and on bended knees, he
unburdens himself of his afflictions, seeks strength in
prayer and prays with his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> on his tongue. In his

bitterness, chases away his anxiety, strengthens him
to triumph over his hardships, and fortifies [69] him
against the assaults of vice and sin. The soothing
gleam of joy dawns on his sorrowful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and, with

Homage, invocation, sacrifice, and the outpouring of
prayer are the various expressions of the inward
longings of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to commune with the divine, to
enter into mutual intercourse with him. Those are
outlets through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> pours forth his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> to
the fountain of all bounty. The <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> who
surrenders himself to unseen powers, who kneels
down in humility at the altar, who with uplifted
<span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> pays homage to the hidden forces behind the

his grievances before him, confesses his guilt, craves
for help, seeks mercy. Devotion is the first requisite.
Mere mutterings of a few formulas with the lips,

there is no devotion; and where there is no devotion,
there is no religion.

dead treated at sacrificial repasts everywhere. The
Indo-Iranians were not behind other peoples and
their sacrificial offerings consisted of milk and melted

butter, grain and vegetables, <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> of goats and sheep,
bulls and horses, and the exhilarating Soma-Haoma
beverage. Elaborate rituals and sacrifices offered to
obtain coveted boons, to gain the remission of sins,
and to stave off the terrors of hell. The consecrated
<span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> was partaken of by the sacrificers to reap the
merit. The altars were reeking with the blood of
animals that were sacrificed to innumerable gods.
Zarathushtra does away with such sacrifices and
purifies rituals.
Ritual is not religion; but it is a powerful aid to
religious life. It feeds the emotional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
which plays the most prominent part in religious life.
It inspires devotional fervour and purity of thoughts.
Zarathushtra presumably utilized this formal side of
religion to stimulate religious emotion and inspire
righteous conduct. Tradition ascribes the division of
<span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> into priests, warriors, husbandmen, and
artisans to the initiative of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Yima [=Jamshed] of
ihe Golden Age of Iran. Zarathushtra does not
recognize this fourfold professional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span>
in the Gathas. He does not mention âthravan, 'the
protector of fire' or priest. The Later Avesta speaks of
the sacerdotal class by the title of âthravan. The
Pahlavi <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> continue to employ this priestly
designation, and in addition <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of it as magopat, or
magpat, corresponding to the Greek <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Magi or
Magus. Zarathushtra uses the forms derived from
maga, 'great,' but it cannot be said that he uses them
in reference to the priestly class. A threefold division
of <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> appears in the Gathas, and Zarathushtra
gives each one altogether different names. They are
[74] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> xvaetu, airyaman, and verezena, probably
indicating his immediate disciples, the nobility, and
the working classes respectively.48

The Later Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of distinct
functionaries who officiated at the sacrificial
ceremonies. The <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of this group is zaotar,
corresponding to Skt. hotar, 'the sacrificer.'
Zarathushtra speaks of himself as a zaotar in one
<span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> with an ethical implication only. As a

offer myazda with homage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Ahura Mazda and

in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the ambrosia and asks Haurvatat and

nothing but the rustle of dry leaves to break the

melodious song, the cooing of the dove restlessly
moving its beautiful neck, the chirping and warbling

the roaring waves rolling up with weakening ripples
and softly breaking at our feet. It is pleasing to hear
the noise of the heavy rain spattering against the
window panes and the puddles in the street, or to see
the snow falling in fleecy flakes. It cheers us to see
the crimson glow at the sunset, the starlit firmament,
powerful wind driving the fleecy clouds before it, the
gambolling of soft, white cloudlets and their chasing
one another like kittens, the bashful endeavour of the

redressing wrongs is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the individual.
<span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> interferes, and in its authoritative position

up a corresponding fiend. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> exact

of a minor demon Druh who with others of her class
stands for malice or hatred. The corresponding

Daevas are generally malevolent male beings. Druj,
on the other hand, is a female fiend. The Gathas give
her greater prominence than to any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> being.

In the abode of Yama, according to the Vedas, was

Zarathushtra's Gathas.4 All precepts in the sacred
stanzas are generally accompanied by a repeated
mention of reward or retribution in this or [102] the
next world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of elevated minds may hold that it is
not a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> moral standard in which an <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
practises virtue in the hope of reward and eschews
vice for <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of retribution. But to be entirely
disinterested in the acting of righteousness, or to
follow virtue for virtue's sake, is a saintly prerogative.
And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not made up of saints. The saint is
the acme in the moral sphere, as is the intellectual
genius in the realm of reason. Both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the climaxes

The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> begets tens of millions of average men, in
contrast to the few isolated types of master-spirits
who inspire the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with their boundless devotion
or enlighten it by their profound intellect. These give

activities of mankind. The saintly type of virtue is the
goal which humanity feebly attempts to reach.
Humanity, as a whole, is evolving towards this ideal
type of virtue, but meanwhile — and let this be
emphasized till the striven for goal is reached — it
needs some sort of incentive to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> conduct in the
lives of its masses. Hence the prime motive of their
embracing righteousness is the hope of future reward,
and that of shunning wickedness is the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of
retribution. In <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> affairs we have to be content
with getting something less than ideal.
It is no wonder, then, if we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> an elaborately
worked out system of rewards and retributions in the
ethical code of the sacred hymns. The faithful
generally pray, among other boons, for endurance,
durability, riches and happiness in this world, and for
rewards, weal, and immortality in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to come.

THE FINAL DISPENSATION
The end of the world. The Gathas <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of a period
when the progress of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> will stop, the evolution

of such saviours being Soshyos [Soshyant], or, to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
the Gathic word, Saoshyant. The term saoshyant, in
both the singular and plural form, occurs in the
Gathas. Here, however, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is used, not as the

over and over again for the period when

world. Beginning with Zoroastrianism, it gave rise to
Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jainism in India, which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the religion of one half of mankind at the
present day. In addition, it developed Judaism in
Palestine, and Taoism and Confucianism in China.
When the Indo-Iranians separated, members of one
group settled in the Panjaub and produced the hymns
of the Rig Veda. Their descendants, who had by this

created the Brahmanas and the Upanishads. Apart
from Buddhism and Jainism, which arose in the
middle of this period of religious and philosophical
efflorescence, we may distinguish at least four stages
of religious evolution, namely those of the Vedas,
Brahmanas, Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita.

These periods do not exclude but overlap one
another. The Vedic period continued for a
considerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> into that of the ritualistic
Brahmanism, and the Brahmanic into that of the
philosophic Upanishads and the Upanishad period
projects into that of the religion of the Bhagavad
Gita.
The Brahmans officiated at the sacrifices and
conducted religious services for the laity. They
propitiated and placated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> with libations and
sacrifices and penances to win magical power. When
the Vedic language and literature became antiquated,
the Brahmans interpreted and amplified the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
texts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> arose the Brahmanas dealing with

were now preoccupied in formulating elaborate

invested with mysterious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to secure for the

equally great. The gods, it is said, were originally
mortals and dreaded death, but later won immortality
by sacrifices. Sacrifice, it is added, enables the
Brahmans to compel the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to do their will.

earthly gifts and heavenly bliss and to raise the estate

animal sacrifices became the central feature of
religion.
Such elaborate ceremonies performed and sacrifices
offered by a specialized priestly class satisfied the
religious needs of the masses of people. The chanting
of the sacred formulas, the sound of bells and
conches, the odour of the burning incense and of
burnt offerings, descended soothingly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

But there were some persons of a deep devotional
disposition whom dreary ritualism and magical
incantations which superseded a religion Qf morality,
did not satisfy and they yearned for <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> personal
religious experience. They longed for passionately
plunging into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the spirit. Such persons
aspired to live religion in their own persons, to
approximate the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of their devotion, to see their

fleshy frame, and the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> seemed to them to be
antagonizing the spirit. Beneath their calm exterior,
they often experienced the tempest raging <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and

concluded, was to quell the tumult of their <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>

practice~ to drill and discipline, control and subdue
their unruly bodies. They <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> their homes and retired
to the forests. They practised various kinds of

austerities, [117] flagellated themselves, emaciated,

devices. They laboured to induce ecstatic <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> by

times. The austerities and devotional exercises of
some advanced ascetic monks, known by the name of
Shramanas, excited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> admiration and reverence of

were mortals originally, say the Atharva Veda and the
Brahmanas, and austerities enabled them to defy
death. Sages and saints attained miraculous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> by
the same means. Manu speaks of the practice of
austerities as the best means of purifying one's life. By
the close of the Vedic period, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was divided into
four stages, being those of discipleship,
householdership, hermitage, and renunciation. The

sensitive to the jars and buffets of life, those who
were temperamentally subject to intense alternating

cloister attracted recluses from all grades of society.

The philosophical religion. Among the forest
dwellers there arose a class of persons to whom the
ascetic life, with its concomitant mortification of
body, failed to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> mental satisfaction. There Were
already germs of theosophy in the Vedic hymns, and
such persons, prone to reflection, began to think
deeply on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> problems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death.
Philosophy has generally led its distinctive existence
as a parallel attempt of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to think out for himself
the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> verities of life, which religion has claimed
to impart through <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> revelation. Religion has
acknowledged it as an aid in its [118] need or as a
handmaid to amplify and elucidate its preachings.
Philosophers have stood as a class by themselves.
Their systems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> have been recognized as
the results of concentrated thinking on the problems
of existence, or as the findings of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> reason.
Philosophy has from its earliest <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> been regarded in
Greece as a secular attempt of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to
solve the riddles of life. India, on the, other hand, has
classed all such thinkers as one group of seers, sages,
or prophets and held the utterance of every thinker
as inspired. The unknown Vedic seer who sings of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as the germ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the hymn of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span>
is giving expression to revealed truth, whereas Thales
of Miletus, who declares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as the first principle,
speaks in terms of cosmogonic philosophy. Kapila's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Sankhya system of numbers is enshrined for all

contemporary, Pythagoras, preaches that <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> is
the first principle of the world, he passes as a lay
thinker grafting his metaphysics on numbers.
With the advent of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> thinkers who weave

their metaphysical speculations into creative systems
of philosophy, <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> religion in India tends to be
philosophical religion, and metaphysical speculation
becomes religious philosophy. The philosophical
religion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> propounded by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> thinkers is
embodied in the Upanishads. These Upanishads are
appendices to Brahmanas and represent the essence
of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Brahmanism. They <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside the Vedic
gods. The supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> of the Brahmanic period was
Prajapati or Brahma, a personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> like the various

this father-god by the impersonal world-soul. They
teach the principle of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> immanence. Personality
implies the existence of another, as an 'I' to a 'thee.' It
is limitation. According to the thinkers, nothing
exists outside of Brahma; all is Brahma. They teach
idealistic monism. Brahma is the only reality, all else
is illusion. The <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> self is a mere reflex of the
Self or Brahma. It is identical with the universal Self.
It is due to ignorance and illusion that this
fundamental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is not recognized.

persisted nonetheless. Like the rise and fall of kings

new ones simultaneously succeeded them. The sacred
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> habitually explain and accommodate new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
by depicting one as incarnating himself in the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span>
of another or by declaring a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> as being
identical [120] with the old one. Rudra, for example
is seen resenting the treatment accorded him. The
supreme Adorable One pacifies him by saying that
homage paid to one was equivalent to that given to
another, for they were both one and the same. When
Bhagavat or Vasudeva rises to be the supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in
the fourth century B.C., Brahma and Shiva are
declared to be his creations and are relegated to
subordinate positions to carry out the will of the new
god. Similarly when Brahmanism later absorbed the
cult of Bhagavat, Vishnu, the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> who was

did not desert them to their fate.
The religion of devotion. Krishna Vasudeva, a
member of the warrior caste, founded Bhagavatism,
the religion of bhakti, devotion or love, about the 4th
century B.C. Bhagavatism arose under the influence
of Sankhya and Yoga. Sankhya being an atheistic
system, Bhagavatism allied itself with Yoga.
Concentration of thought, which is Yoga's
fundamental concern, was converted into devotion to
a personal God. This personal God, whom he termed
the Adorable One, was the objective of man's
devotion and love. This doctrine is later propounded
in the Bhagavad Gita, or the Song Celestial,
originally composed in the 2nd century B.C. and

surviving in its later redacted form. In transcendent
beauty and elegance of form, this philosophical poem
is among the sublimest that have been vouchsafed to
man. It teaches an eclectic philosophy weaving ideas
from Sankhya and Yoga around the central doctrine
of devotion or <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> to God.

— such is the message of the Gita. Rituals,
concentration of thought, and disciplinary ascetic
practices are aids to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of devotion or <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for

Action, he says, is better than inaction and he adds

that immunity from action can be had by action
alone. Action should be for the sake of accomplishing
it and not for its resulting rewards. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has to

still, says Krishna, he should do his deeds in the name

IRAN GOES BACK TO INDO-IRANIAN
RELIGION
The Indo-Iranian cult passes under the mantle of
Zarathushtra. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Vishtaspa was succeeded by
weak kings and Eastern Iran soon lost political
importance. Zarathushtra, likewise, was not <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span>
with successors of commanding personalities to carry
on their missionary work. His religion could not
penetrate into Western Iran, where the cult of the
Indo-Iranian divinities had a strong hold over the
minds and hearts of the people. Mithra occupied the
pre-eminent position among them, with the nonIranian Anahita as the close <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> in importance.
Ahura Mazda outshone Mithra with his transcendent
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> sublimity and ethical greatness. Besides, he
had come with profound prestige as his cult was
proclaimed by the new prophet himself. He was

easily acclaimed as the most incomparable divinity
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had ever known. Mithra, Anahita, and other
bagas, as we have seen from the inscriptions of the
successors of Darius, accepted to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> under the new
supreme God.
The stronghold of Zarathushtra's religion was Eastern
Iran. His religion was a reform of the primitive <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
of the Iranians. But the reform did not last long,
owing to the counter-reformation that followed his
death. The excellence of his highly ethical religion
was indelibly imprinted on the minds of the cultured
classes, but it had not reached the masses. They
could not comprehend the abstract ideas of the new
prophet, whereas they found it easy to invoke Mithra
and his heavenly associates with elaborate rituals and
sacrifices. Their veneration for these older divinities,
now in exile, had not ceased. They viewed the
movement of the revival of the Indo-Iranian <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> favour. The leaders of the Zoroastrian
Church, on the other hand, were alarmed at this

growing tendency to go back to the preZarathushtrian faith. They sought a compromise. A
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious syncretism then <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> place, with the
result that the successors of [126] the prophet were
obliged to accommodate the Indo-Iranian divinities
in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> household of Ahura Mazda. Mithra was
the most popular divinity at the period in Western
Iran from where his cult, as we shall see later, passed
on to Europe. It is expressly said that Ahura Mazda
and the Amesha Spentas were pleased with his
religion and accepted it, and Ahura Mazda conferred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him the chieftainship of the world,1 Mithra and
his co-workers were made to give their allegiance to
Ahura Mazda and to agree to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as the satraps in
his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> kingdom. The Yashts or hymns dedicated

to the several Yazatas open with the declaration that
they are created by Ahura Mazda. Mithra is created
by Ahura Mazda. The Yasht composed in honour of
the angel Verethraghna, begins with the
acknowledgment that Verethraghna is Ahura-dhâta,
'created by Ahura (Mazda).' In return, Mithra and his
old compatriots secured the privilege of sharing the
homage and adoration of mankind with their
heavenly sovereign Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda and
his six <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> attributes were now openly
recognized as seven impersonations of the cardinal
virtues of Ahura Mazda, and were given a class
designation, Amesha Spentas or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> Immortals.
These Amesha Spentas were given the first rank in
the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> hierarchy and the Indo-Iranian divinities
and those of pre-Zoroastrian Iranian origin were
classed under the epithet Yazata or Adorable One,
and assigned a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> hierarchy.
The Amesha Spentas are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the archangels and
Yazatas the angels in the newly formed Zoroastrian
pantheon.
With the return of the pre-Zoroastrian divinities also
came the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> rituals and sacrifices, offerings and
libations. The beliefs and practices of the old <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
were engrafted on the religion. The writers ascribe
them to the authorship of Zarathushtra. He is himself
depicted as glorifying and worshipping the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Indo-Iranian divinities whom he did not recognize in
his Gathas. He is shown begging them for various
boons. The Indo-Iranian religion that Zarathushtra
came to replace by his religion of reform <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lives as
an indissoluble part of his religion. Zoroastrianism
became a blend of the two, that is, the Indo-Iranian
religion and Zarathushtra's religion of reform. And so
it remains up to the present day, as we shall see in

subsequent pages.

The Avestan people. The races that formed the
Zoroastrian fold were the Bactrians, the Medes, and
the Persians, who successively rose to political
independence in <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> Iran. The Bactrians of the
Northeast, the Medians of the Northwest, and the
Persians of the Southwest, were politically welded
into one Persian nation, under the Achaemenian
empire. This process of blending these different
peoples into one homogeneous nation under the
creed of Zoroaster was completed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the

nationalities of diverse faiths, and the rulers were
always tolerant towards the religions of these subject
races. Guided by political expediency, they often
built or restored the temples of alien peoples, and
occasionally even honoured the Jewish, Egyptian,
Babylonian, and Greek divinities.10 Cyrus ordered the
restoration of temple at Jerusalem,11 and Darius, the

the lapse of time, however, the Medes and the
Persians became more reconciled to each other. The
Magi were the priests of the Medes; they now
became the priests of the Persians. This strengthened
their position. The classical writers held their names
in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times as synonymous with the <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of
the East. Magic and magician are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>

the ceremonies, chanted the hymns, sacrificed at the

expounded dreams, and ministered to the various

is Herodotus, who wrote about a century and a
quarter before the fall of the Achaemenian empire.
Writing at a period when the Persians were in the
zenith of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in Western Iran, and when the
Magi were the recognized class, he, with the other
writers that followed him, acquainted the West with
the Magi. The athravans, the real custodians of the
Avesta and the guardians of the Zoroastrian symbol of
fire, are unknown to these writers. This may be due

to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that Eastern Iran, which was the home of
the athravans, had politically declined, and the
writers are mainly concerned with the Persians of the
west, and their immediate predecessors, the Medes.
The Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not recognize the Magi. The
forms derived from the term maga, 'great' occurring in
the Gathas and the Later Avesta do not represent this
priestly class. We <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> a solitary passage, presumably
a late interpolation, which pronounces a curse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
those who ill-treat the Magi.51 We may add a <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span>
in which Ahura Mazda tells Zarathushtra that he
prefers a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has a wife to one who lives as a

mouth, and a khrafstraghna in his hand; but it is an

throughout the texts. It is the only privileged priestly
class that the Avesta recognizes.

THE YOUNGER AVESTAN RELIGION
From the Gathas to the Later Avesta, a retrograde
step. We now enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a new field of

composition of the Haptanghaiti, or the section to
'Seven Chapters' in the Avestan Yasna, <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the
Gathic dialect during the transition period that
intervened between the close of the Gathic age and
the opening of the Avestan period. The lofty tone of
the earlier compositions gradually declines, and the
greater part of the Yasna, Yashts, and Vendidad

becomes heavy and monotonous. On only rare
occasions do the <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> exhibit sudden flashes of
transcendent beauty and devout fervour. The
growing tendency is for complexity and
concreteness. The Gathas generally dealt with the
abstract concepts. Every one of the Amesha Spentas,
as we have already seen, impersonated some cardinal
virtue. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> Asha, the genius of righteousness, and
Haurvatat, that of perfection, have each a Yasht
consecrated to them in the Younger Avesta, the
abstract virtues of these archangels do not receive
any recognition in these hymns. The secondary and
concrete qualities with new associations loom larger
in the thoughts of their composers than do the
primary qualifications. Rather than dealing with the
righteousness of Asha Vahishta and the perfection of
Haurvatat, the later <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> expatiate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their healing
powers by means of the recital of the various
formulas of magical efficacy and the spells to drive
away the demons of diseases and death. This general
tendency of drifting towards the concrete and
material in religion is the characteristic feature of the
times and endures throughout the Younger Avestan
as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the subsequent Pahlavi period, in which it
reaches its climax.
Daena, Chisti, Mithra, Raman, Rata, Manthra,

the ordinary meanings are now personified as angels.
The angels that outshine the archangels. Some of
the Yazatas, both those or pure Iranian extraction
and those of Indo-Iranian origin, have risen to such a

honoured more than the Amesha Spentas. The angels
Anahita and Tishtrya, Mithra, and Verethraghna
figure more prominently than the archangels Vohu
Manah and Asha Vahishta, Armaiti, and Ameretat.
Some of the longest Yashts, or sacrificial hymns, are
composed in their honour. The Yasht dedicated to
Mithra, for example, is eight times larger than the
one composed in honour of Ahura Mazda himself.
The archangels, who are <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

Gathas, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> the prophet ever sang with

dedication. Some of the attributes that are the
prerogative of Ahura Mazda alone are lavishly
applied to the leading angels; but the authors are
sparing even to parsimony when they confer
honorific epithets on the Amesha Spentas.
Their imprecations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their careless votaries. A
few of the Yazatas, or Adorable Ones, are conjointly
honoured with Ahura Mazda in the same strain. They
are eager to help <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and stand by his side in the
hour of his need, if they are invoked. They help man,
if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> remembers them. Moreover, they are

offerings. Tishtrya despondently complains to Ahura
Mazda that he is worsted by his adversary Apaosha
because mankind do not propitiate him with
sacrifices as they ought to. If they did so, Tishtrya
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be emboldened and enabled to conduct his

Tishtrya complains that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do not <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span>

who are more popular among them. Mithra, likewise,

complains of man's occasional neglect of his
invocation, which evokes his displeasure. And Mithra
is terrible when angered. Unless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> appeases his
wrath by abundant sacrifices, he punishes his
wretched victim mercilessly. Similarly, the Fravashis,
or Guardian Spirits, are the most helpful genii, but on
[147] condition that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> propitiates them with
sacrifices. When satisfied, they are of indescribable
help, but once offended they are hard to deal with.
They are to be approached with religious awe. They
are to be feared, rather than loved. This <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of the
celestial <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> may engender obedience in man, but
not devotion. And devotion is the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
virtues.
Ahura Mazda invokes his heavenly ministers for
help. In the Gathas we saw Ahura Mazda cooperating and holding conferences and working in
consort with his heavenly subordinates. The Younger
Avesta gives a picture of a step in advance in this
direction. Here Ahura Mazda is often depicted as

and Mithra as worthy of honour, sacrifice, and prayer
as himself.4 Rather than commanding his envoys and
viceroys as the sovereign ruler to put his orders into
execution, he solicits their co-operation in his work.
Besides, Ahura Mazda's <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> sacrifices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> other

Mazda and his prophet. The greater part of the

Vendidad and some of the Yashts are composed in
this style. Escorted by the celestial Yazatas, Ahura

meeting of mortals convened by Yima, and warns
him of the coming destructive winter and frost.13

A race of sturdy nomads of Semitic stock tending their flocks from times

AHURA MAZDA
Ahura, Mazda, and Ahura Mazda. The name of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> still retains its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

metrical sections of the Younger Avesta the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elements are sometimes <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
apart from each other, or either one of the terms may be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to designate
the Supreme Being, but in the prose compositions the collocation Ahura
Mazda generally occurs as a compound phrase. In the formation of
compounds, however, either Ahura or Mazda alone is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> for the sake of
convenience. The Ahura compounds such as Ahura-dhâta, 'created by Ahura,'
Ahura-tkaesha, 'of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Ahura,' or the adjectival <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> âhuiri, 'of Ahura,'

Similarly, the Mazda
element in the compounds Mazda-dhâta, 'created by Mazda,' Mazda-yasna,
'worshipper of Mazda,' Mazdo-frasasta, 'taught by Mazda,' Mazdo-fraokhta, or
Mazdaokhta, 'spoken by Mazda,' invariably stands for Ahura Mazda himself.
Ahura Mazda is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of worship. Ahura Mazda still holds

righteousness is undisputed, and his imperial right is unchallenged. He is the
greatest and the very best of the angels.1 The Old Persian Inscriptions <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span>
of him as the greatest of the divinities.2 The archangels and angels dutifully
carry out Mazda's orders. Reverence for him has never abated, and adoration
of him does not languish with the advent again of the old Indo-Iranian
divinities. Like the dual divinities Varuna-Mitra who received joint
invocation during the Indo-Iranian period, Ahura-Mithra or Mithra-Ahura
are invoked together. Ahura generally takes precedence and Mithra stands
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> in the compound,3 but in the Nyaishes composed in [155] honour of

concept of God. He is not invested with any anthropomorphic chracter, and
his multifarious epithets are truly the figurative expressions of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

of Thales (about 600 B.C.), the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of the school of Miletus, the Greek
thinkers were in touch with the Orient. The Ionians were in close contact
with the Persians. Pythagoras, we have seen, was believed by the classical
writers to have been the pupil of Zoroaster, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> several centuries

Plato reproduce the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the Magi and Brahmans, Egyptians
and Jews. Alexandria became later a cosmopolitan seat of learning, and the
intellectual East and West met there. It was here that Judaism and afterwards
Christianity were Hellenized. The <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the East was held in <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>

the early formative period of its philosophy. Zarathushtra, we have noticed,
postulated a quasi-independent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> intermediary between the godhead and

the regulating principle of existence. Plato says in his Timaeus that the
universe becomes an organism through the universal World-Soul that is
created by the Demiurge, the Supreme Deity. The Old Testament Tefers to

Logos is something more than Plato's
<span class="t0 hoverable">Idea</span> of the Good, because, like Spenta Mainyu, he is creatively active. In
common with Spenta Mainyu, Logos is not a personal being, and like Spenta

Mainyu again, he appears sometimes as identified with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and at other
times seems to be an attribute of God. The Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> refer to Spenta
Mainyu and his adversary Angra Mainyu as thworeshtar or the fashioners [159]
or cutters and, speaking about the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Logos, Philo speaks of him as

he is also the darkness or shadow of God. This is so because, he adds, the

same as that which exists between Ahura Mazda and Spenta Mainyu. The

represents the will, power, and energy of God. He is the creator on behalf of
God. He has introduced harmony in the universe and conducts its affairs as
the pilot.
1. Genesis 1.2. The relation between Ahura Mazda and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit. It
remains as subtle in the Younger Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> as it was in the Gathas. We
have already seen in the treatment of this highly abstract concept, as it is
portrayed in the Gathic texts, that the term Spenta Mainyu either designated
Ahura Mazda as his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attribute, or occurred as a being separate from the
godhead. The Later Avestan texts, it seems to us, lead us to the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that
Spenta Mainyu has no independent existence apart from Ahura Mazda, in
other words, as shown above, he is not a personal being. The Later Avesta,

moreover, as we shall see in the subsequent pages, teaches that all earthly
and heavenly [160] beings, belonging to the Kingdom of Goodness,
including Ahura Mazda himself, have their Fravashis, or Guardian Spirits.
Spenta Mainyu alone in the realm of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his Guardian Spirit.
Furthermore, Spenta Mainyu does not receive homage and invocation from
man, as do Ahura Mazda, the Amesha Spentas, and the Yazatas. In one
<span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> the faithful dedicate their thoughts, words, deeds, and all to him.2
Spenta Mainyu, therefore, may be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as an atttibute of Ahura Mazda
which is either conjointly <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> with the godhead as his distinguishing
epithet, or occurs alone by itself to designate the Supreme Being. In this
latter use, it may be said, Spenta Mainyu represents Ahura Mazda, in the
same manner as the royal title 'His Majesty' is frequently <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as a substitute
for the name of a king. 2. Y58.6.

Vohu Manah retains his pre-eminent position in the Later Avestan period.
He occupies his seat next to Ahura Mazda in the celestial council. The other

name of the archangel, but simply connotes its ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

ASHA VAHISHTA
The formation of the name. The Younger Avesta, in conformity with the
Gathas, calls this archangel Asha and adds the epithet vahishta or 'best' to the
name. The variant stem arta is, however, found as an element of Astvatereta,
the name of the renovator [soshyant].49 It is also met with in the proper
names during the Achaemenian period. We have, for example,
Artakhshathra, Artadata, Artapata, and Artafarnah. Its forms areta, 'proper,'
and anareta or anaretha, 'improper,' are likewise found.50 A righteous <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ashavan which is equivalent to the [166] Vedic rtâvan. In the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
Avestan ashahe khâ and Vedic khâ rtasya, 'source of righteousness,' we have an
interesting instance of the common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> employed by both.51

51. Y10.4; RV2.28.5. His righteousness remains the basic doctrine of
Zoroastrianism during the Later Avestan period. Ahura Mazda is the
righteous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of righteousness.52 Among the many names by which Ahura
Mazda is invoked in the hymn dedicated to him, the fourth is Asha Vahishta
or Best Righteousness.53 Ahura Mazda has created Asha Vahishta, or Best
Righteousness,54 who is the greatest, best, fairest, the radiant, the all-good
archangel.55 In one instance he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by the Indo-Iranian epithet bagha,
'divinity.' He it is who smites disease, death, fiends, sorcerers, noxious
creatures, and his adversary Druj, Deceit or Wickedness.56 Zarathushtra for
that <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> proclaims the <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of Asha Vahishta, through whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to
the abode of the archangels, paradise, becomes easy.57 The souls of the dead,
who are the Fravashis of the righteous, dwell in the shining realm of Asha
Vahishta.58 This celestial personification gives joy to the souls of the
righteous dead.59 It is through him that the devotee aspires to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t11 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t26 hoverable">behold</span> and
reach Ahura Mazda.60 He offers homage and adoration to him along with
Ahura Mazda.61 Emphasizing Zarathushtra's dictum in the Gathas, the
Younger Avesta affirms that there is one path alone that leads to the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>

life, and that is the Path of Righteousness.62 The Vedas likewise allude to the
Path of Rta.63 The Achaemenian kings refer to the Right Path in their rock

Righteousness is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> riches. Man, we are told, pines for the riches of

which is the real and permanent wealth. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> starts on a journey, he

is most consistently developed throughout the entire subsequent literature. It
is the favourite theme on which, the Zoroastrian theologians are never tired

and uncleanness, purity and impurity, has evoked an extensive literature. The
tenets of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in this respect have been worked out into a science of
health. Bodily purity is indispensable to purity of mind. Cleanliness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

diseases. As the many kinds of healers restore bodily health by herbs and
drugs, and remove the tumours and cancers by knife and implements, so
there are healers that heal through righteousness or by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> spell. We

mostly consecrated to Asha Vahishta's associate Airyaman, the guardian

in the writings of the Greek philosophers of the period. Heraclitus, who
flourished at Ephesus, near the end of the sixth century B.C., postulates <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
as the first principle from which everything that exists has come. It is
working as <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> or Logos and reveals the stable, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> in the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span>

invoked in company of marezhdika, 'mercy,'104 who is styled the protector of

helper of the poor to the Ahuna Vairya [Ahunwar] formula.

YAZATAS
The Zoroastrian angels. Next in rank to the Amesha Spentas come the
Yazatas, literally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> the 'adorable ones.' We <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the corresponding

there. If the Amesha Spentas are the archangels in Zoroastrian theology, the
Yazatas are the angels. They are numbered by hundreds and by thousands,1
by tens of thousands and by hundreds of thousands, nay even more.2 About
forty only, however, are mentioned in the extant Avestan text. Plutarch
refers to twenty-four.3 The prominent Yazatas mentioned by name in Y16.46; Sr1.8-30; 2.8-30, closely correspond to the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> mentioned by the
Greek writer. Several of the Yazatas have individually consecrated to them a
Yasht, or hymn of praise, which narrates the doings and functions of its
respective genius. Besides the Yashts that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a special biographical

the record of their achievements. Ahura Mazda himself is a Yazata,4 even as
he is an Amesha Spenta. He is the greatest and the best Yazata.5
Zarathushtra himself is spoken of as a Yazata.6

have already seen, pre-Zoroastrian and go back to the Indo-Iraniam period;
but with the exception of Sraosha, Atar, and Ashi, they do not appear in the
Gathas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> frequent enough in the Later Avesta. In fact, they permeate
all the later texts, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an indissoluble part of the Zoroastrian pantheon.
We shall group them under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> headings and distinguish those that are
common to the Indians and the Iranians from those that are purely Iranian.
[174] Indo-lranian: Mithra, Airyaman, Haoma, Verethraghna, Parendi, Rata,
Nairyosangha, Apam Napat, Ushah, and Vayu.
Iranian: Atar, Ardvi Sura Anahita, Hvarekhshaeta, Maonghah, Tishtrya
Drvaspa, Sraosha, Rashnu, Raman, Daena, Chisti, Erethe, Rasanstat, Ashi
Vanghuhi, Arshtat, Asman, Zam, Manthra Spenta, Damoish Upamana, and
Anaghra Raochah.
Characteristics of the Yazatas. Like their celestial elders, the Amesha
Spentas, the Yazatas impersonate abstract ideas and virtues, or concrete
objects of nature. Many of them preside over both <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and material
phenomena. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> Yazatas Hvarekhshaeta, Mithra, Maonghah, Ardvi
Sura, Atar, and others personify the sun, light, moon, water, and fire. At
times their names designate merely the objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> that they personify.
This simultaneous treatment of the dual aspect of these angels is frequently
found in one and the same paragraph and makes it difficult to distinguish the
actual impersonations from the personified objects. Very often praise and
<span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> are offered more to the sun, light, moon, water, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> as such than
to the Yazatas presiding over them. We learn from Herodotus that the
Persians sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the sun, moon, earth, fire, water, and winds.7 7.
Herod. 1.131. Instances are not wanting in which a Yazata begins his career
as the personification of some one particular virtue or an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of nature,
but with the lapse of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> either substitutes for it some other or widens his

of the Yazatas are lacking in real individuality.

sacrifices. To Anahita as celestial guardian of the waters, to Drvaspa, who
protects cattle, and to Vayu, the wind, a hundred horses, a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> oxen,
and ten <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> sheep are consecrated in <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> by some of the early
kings and heroes. We shall turn to this subject later.
Division of the Yazatas according to their grammatical gender. The
Yazatas are both males and females, or rather the personifications of virtues
and ideas that are in gender masculine and feminine. There is no distinction
between these male and female divinities. Both of them are on the same
level, occupy the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of honour, and receive the same amount of
homage. The gentle <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> becoming to the fair sex is allotted to female

angels, and they are as powerful and awe-inspiring in their own sphere of
activity as their fellow-workers of the opposite sex are in theirs. The female
angels are: Ushah, Zam, Ardvi Sura Anahita, Drvaspa, Daena, Chisti,
Arshtat, Erethe, Rasanstat Ashi Vanghuhi, Parendi, and Rata. All others are
the male sex.
Group Yazatas. The usual manner of sacrificing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the angels is to invoke
each one separately by his name, or in company of his comrades and coworkers, or in joint pairs. On this last point we shall <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> anon under a
separate heading. Sometimes all the angels are invoked in a group under the
comprehensive title of vispe Yazata, "all Yazatas,"13 Closely corresponding to
the Vedic vishve Devâh, 'all Divinities.' In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> an entire <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> of the ritual is
dedicated to the various <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> lords under the title Visperad, literally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> 'all lords.'
13. Y1.19; 2.18; Yt11.17; 17.19; WFr. 5.1. Dual Yazatas. A particular feature
common to the Avestan and Vedic religions is the arrangement of certain
divinities in pairs, who are revered together. As some of the Yazatas guard
more than one abstract virtue or impersonate more than one [176] natural
phenomenon, it is not uncommon to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> one Yazata entering into
partnership with various Yazatas according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of his work. For
instance, Mithra, as the sovereign <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of wide pastures, forms a pair with
Ahura; as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of light, he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in consort with Hvarekhshaeta, the
genius of light; as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of truth, he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in company with Rashnu; and
as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of plenty and prosperity, he enters into a comradeship with
Raman. The more prominent of the dual divinities are Ahura-Mithra,14
Hvarekhshaeta-Mithra,15 Mithra-Rashnu,16 Mithra-Raman,17 RashnuArshtat,18 Raman-Vayu,19 Daena-Chisti,20 Ashi Vanghuhi-Parendi,21 and
Asman-Zamyat.22 Sometimes a special attribute of one Yazata is extended to
his associate, and they share the characteristic qualities and functions of each
other.

generally <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct orders of the Yazatas. They are mainyava,
'spiritual or celestial,' and gaethya, 'material or terrestrial.'23 We are not,
however, informed what particular Yazatas are grouped under each of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes. A very recent gloss in the Pahlavi version of the Avestan Litany
Khurshid Niyayesh explains that the terrestrial angels are such as Fire, Ardvi
Sura's Waters, the Wind, the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth. These are so
called, adds the commentator, because they can be seen by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with his

we shall class the Yazatas under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> main divisions. Those Yazatas who
commonly <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for one and the same virtue, or preside over some one
particular phenomenon, will be classed under the sub-titles of such a virtue
or a phenomenon common to them. Thus, for example, all the Yazatas that
guard rectitude will be treated in one group, and those that preside over
1ight will be dealt with together. In cases [177] where a Yazata presides over
more than one virtue, we shall class this particular angel under the most
prominent and characteristic of his virtues.

DAENA
Religion deified. One of the least personified Yazatas is Daena, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

made to her companion, and various boons are asked from her. Daena has no
share in this. She is simply mentioned by name in invocation along with
Chisti. Even here she is assigned a secondary place, for Chisti takes

precedence over her. Throughout the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are

CHISTI
Divinity of religious wisdom. Unlike her partner, just mentioned, Chisti,
divinity of religious wisdom, has a personality that is sharply defined. Her
standing epithets are 'good' and 'most upright.' She is the most upright,
holy, bearing libations, wearing a white garment as her emblem.59
Zarathushtra longs to own her and devoutly implores her to grant him,
among other things, the clearest vision.60 The prophet's noble consort
Hvovi, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the itinerant priests and the lords of the country, are among
her supplicants, asking various boons, which she grants to those who are
pure in heart.61 The faithful <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> to approach Ahura Mazda through the

MITHRA
His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the Avestan pantheon. Of all the Indo-Iranian divinities that
have found their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the Zarathushtrian theology, Mithra is the most
prominent figure. As an associate of Varuna, Mithra's individuality was
eclipsed during the Indo-Iranian period. After the separation of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
groups of the Aryan people, Mithra rose to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> eminence, and was the
premier divinity in Western Iran, when Zarathushtra preached his religion.
During the period of syncretism after the passing away of the prophet,
Mithra became the most conspicuous angel of the Younger Avestan period.
The longest Yasht, which is eight times longer than the Yasht composed in
honour of Ahura Mazda, celebrates his greatness. He is the most masculine,
exacting, implacable, and relentless of all the Yazatas. Ahura Mazda has
created him the most glorious of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Yazatas,105 as worthy of
<span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and prayer as himself.106 The description of him in the Yasht that is
dedicated in his honour gives a vivid picture of the character of the preZarathushtrian divinities that came to be worshipped in Iran. Mithra was the
most eminent of the primitive Ahuras, as he was conjointly worshipped with
Ahura Mazda.107 The writer who consecrated Yasht 10 in his honour was
conversant with the past greatness of this divinity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> cult had struck so
deep a root in the popular mind. He certainly was unsparing in eulogizing
the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of this genius in the universe. The <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> sometimes <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of Mithra
in terms that are usually applied to Ahura Mazda, and the latter [184] himself
is represented in this particular Yasht as having sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Mithra.108
The heptad of the Amesha Spentas having been already complete, Mithra is

not raised to the rank of these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> beings. but is assigned a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> among

over this earth, Mithra is the strongest, the most sturdy, the most active, the
most swift, and the most victorious.110 Ahura Mazda has created him the
most glorious of all the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> Yazatas.111 The composer of the Yasht who
sings to his favourite divinity applies to him the same honorific epithets as
are applied to the godhead. Mithra is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> omniscient, which is strictly
speaking the epithet of Mazda alone.112 He is the greatest of the Yazatas,
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> shining like the moon, and <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> (ainika), as brilliant as Tishtrya.113
It is interesting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> that the Rig Veda uses the correspording Skt. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
(anika), and says that Varuna's <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> is as shining as that of Agni.114 He is the
strongest of the strong the sturdiest of the sturdy, the most intelligent among
the divinities, victorious, glorious, heroic, and the undeceivable one, deep,
courageous, weal-giving, propitiated when invoked, exalted, skilful, with a

giver of good, of ten <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> spies, heroic, and the all-knowing.115 He is
ever afoot, watchful, valiant, a dominating figure in the assembly, causing the
waters to flow, listening to appeals, causing the trees to grow, ruling over the
district <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of devices, a creature of wisdom.116 He is the swiftest among the
swift, generous among the generous, valiant among the valiant, chief among
the chiefs [185] of assembly, increase-giving, fatness-giving, flock-giving,

son-giving, life-giving, felicity-giving, joy-giving, glory-giving, kingdomgiving, and piety-giving.117 Mithra is highly merciful, foremost, and
peerless.118 He is the protector and guardian of an creatures.119 He is the
most fiend-smiting among all the Yazatas.120 He is both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and bad for

wide knowledge, he furthers the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of Spenta Mainyu.122 The sixteenth

and are invoked for special help.124 Mithra is again jointly invoked with
Hvarkhshaeta, the angel presiding over the sun. This is natural, because one
of the chief Iunctions of Mithra is to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as the guardian of light. Of the

Mithra protects truth. Consequently at an early date he is associated with
Rashnu, who is the chief genius of truth.126 They are united as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> friends,127
One of the principal attributes of Mithra is that he is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of wide

Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas, being in one accord with the sun,
have built up for Mithra a dwelling as wide as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in this material

sickness and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the offender, depriving him also of his offspring and

Similarly, the faithful devoutly invoke Mithra by his name with libations,

libation.182 In these observances we can [191] recognize the beginnings of
the later Mithraic rites and mysteries for which the cult of Mithra, centuries
afterwards, became famous. Mithra demands that his <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> shall be
performed with out-and-out devotion. Ahura Mazda says <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Zarathushtra

Mithra will be satisfied, and will straightway come to the dwelling of the

Mithra's boons. He is constantly spoken of as giving happy and joyful abode,
to the Aryan peoples. Many indeed are the boons asked for from Mithra by
his votaries, who always approach him with love, homage and sacrifice. He is
generally invoked to come to the faithful for help, freedom, joy, mercy,
healing, victory, well-being, and sanctification. The masters of the house,
clan, town, and country invoke him for help, so do the poor, when wronged,
look to him for the redress of their grievances.l88 The husbandman solicits

RASHNU
Personification of truth. This angel is preeminently genius of truth. His
standing epithet is razishta, 'most upright'. To adopt the phraseology of the
Younger Avestan texts, Rashnu is the most holy, the most well-shaped,
exalted, courageous, most knowing, the most discerning, the most foreknowing, most far-seeing, the most helping, the greatest smiter of thieves
and bandits.l96 He is as bright as the fire.197 Zarathushtra blesses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>

chief celestial judge who presides at the ordeal. No specific habitat is
assigned to Rashnu. The officiating priest has to invoke him to come to the
ordeal from whatever part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he happens to be in at that time,

ARSHTAT
Divinity of rectitude. Arshtat or Arshti is the female genius of truth. She
does not play any prominent part in the Younger Avestan period. She cooperates with Mithra, Sraosha, and Rashnu in the judgment of the dead.
Although the 18th Yasht is dedicated to Arshtat and bears her name, there is
not in it a single mention of her by name; the entire hymn treats only of the
Aryan Glory. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sirozah passages (1.26, 2.26) Mount Ushidarena

VERETHRAGHNA
The angel of victory. Verethraghna belongs to the Indo-Iranian divinities.
He is one of the most popular divinities of the Iranian cult. Indra's most
distinctive epithet in the Rig Veda is Vrtrahan, 'the slayer of Vrtra.' Its
Avestan corresponding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is Verethraghna which, however, is not <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as
an epithet of some angel, but is the name of a powerful angel. Verethraghna
impersonates victory and he has preserved this trait throughout the various
epochs of Iranian religious thought. The Yasht bearing his name celebrates

his exploits. As the genius of victory, and created by Ahura Mazda,
Verethraghna is the best armed of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> angels.214 He is the most
courageous in courage, the most victorious in victory, the most glorious in
glory, the most abounding in favours, the best giver of welfare, and the most
healing in health-giving.215 He is the giver of manliness, inflicting death,
maker of a new world, resolute, and self-willed.216 214. Yt14.1,6,etc.

RAMAN

He causes the joy of life. Another instance of a hymn consecrated in name
to one Yazata, but wholly devoted to the praise and glorification of another,
is furnished by Ram Yasht (15). Raman is merely invoked by name along
with Vayu at the beginning [196] and the end of the Yasht. Vayu, the genius
of wind, is the co-labourer of Raman, and the Yasht treats of his
achievements. Raman Khvastra is the genius of the joy of life. The joy that
he imparts is not the joy of the spirit, and does not convey any <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

invoked along with Daena, the genius of religion, and Vohu Manah's
wisdom.248 As an angel presiding over the formulas of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> he wards off
evil, exorcises those possessed of the demons, and heals the sick; he is
consequently invoked to heal the ninety-nine <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> nine hundred and

most glorious one,250 and like every other angel, Manthra Spenta has his

spenta is also freely <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to designate the sacred texts. It is also <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> for the
magical spells of various degrees of efficacy. These spells are interspersed in
the Avestan texts, especially in the Yashts and the Vendidad. Their conjuring
efficacy is very great. They are supposed to have inherent mysterious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of their own, and the mere recital of these magical charms produces
marvellous effects. The mystical compositions, as such, are credited with
some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> efficacy, some superhuman power; and through the

drives away sickness from the body.255 These magical incantations are mostly
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to drive away the demons of defilement, disease, and death. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>

The chief spells. Some of the most excellent, the most mighty, the most
efficacious, the most smiting, the most victorious, the most healing, the
greatest, and the best of the spells are the Ahuna Vairya formula, the
Airyaman Ishya prayer, the names of Ahura Mazda and of the Amesha
Spentas.258 The Airyaman Ishya is the greatest, best, fairest, most fearful,
most firm most victorious, and the most healing of all spells.259 Saoshyant
and his companions will recite the Airyaman Ishya prayer at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the

composed in the Gathic dialect and are of rare merit. They are next in
importance only to the most sacred formula of all, the Ahuna Vairya, which
is spoken of in the following paragraph.

Ahuna Vairya. The greatest of all the spells, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Word</span> par excellence of the
Zarathushtrian theology, which is constantly on the tongue of the faithful, is
the Ahuna Vairya. It is made up of twenty-one words, every one of which
corresponds to one [201] of the twenty-one Nasks which make up the
complete <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Holy</span> Writ of the Zoroastrians. It is the quintessence of the entire
scriptures. In reply to the prophet's inquiry about the origin of this sacred
formula, Ahura Mazda says that before the heavens, before the waters,
before the earth, before the animals, before the trees, before the fire, before
men, before the archangels, before the demons. and before the entire
material existence, Ahuna Vairya was.261 Ahura Mazda pronounced it when
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was not.262 One correct recitation of it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any omission is
worth the chanting of a hundred Gathas,263 and will enable the devout to
reach paradise.264 Of all the sacred formulas that have ever been pronounced
or are now recited, or which will be recited hereafter, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

The value of the recitation and the intonation of the formula is greatly
impaired when it is inattentively chanted with errors and omissions.270 Ahura

repel evil. The Airyaman Ishya prayer is generally repeated four times. The
most frequently occurring formulas that are repeated in various numbers, as
the occasion demands, are the Ashem Vohu and the Ahuna Vairya. They are
generally <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> at the opening or at the close of all prayers. The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of
times which they are recited varies from one to a hundred thousand, or to be
precise, the following specific numbers are found among the references to
the [202] different prayers: one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, ten,
twelve, twenty-one, one hundred, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred, twelve hundred, and a

AIRYAMAN
The genius of health. This Indo-Iranian divinity originally conveys the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
of comradeship and occurs in the Vedas as a groomsman at the wedding rites
and casually in the Avesta in connection with the wedding rites. The Fiftyfourth <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of the Yasna is consecrated to Airyaman. He is invoked to
come down to the wedding for the joy of the faithful.284 In regard to
attributes given to Airyaman we may add in this connection that his standing
epithet is 'the beloved one.' 284 Y54.1.
But Airyaman plays a more prominent part in the Iranian literature as the
genius of health. He is an acolyte to Asha Vahishta, and is invoked <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
with him.285 The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> Yasht, which bears the name of Asha Vahishta, is, in
fact, mostly devoted to Airyaman. Ahura Mazda created this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> immune
from any sickness and disease, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> introduced therein ninetynine <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> nine hundred and ninety-nine diseases.286 Ahura Mazda
accordingly sends his messenger Nairyosangha to Airyaman with the request
to go to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with his healing remedies. Airyaman quickly obeys the
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> command and begins his work.287 He smites and drives away all kinds
of sickness and death, magic and sorcery.288 Airyaman [204] does not heal by
means of herbs and drugs, medicine and surgery, but by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> spells. In
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> one of the greatest of such sacred formulas, the Airyaman Ishya, as we
have already seen, bears his name and is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to smite all manner of disease

and death.289 At the recital of the magic formula flee sickness and death,
demons and infidels, the two-legged brood of wolfish and serpentine nature,
pride and scorn, slander and strife, falsehood and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> eye, courtezan and

HAOMA
The divinity of joint Indo-Iranian fame. One of the most distinctive features
common to the Indo-Iranian peoples before their separation is the HaomaSoma cult. The Avestan Haoma is identical with Vedic Soma, and both refer
to the sacred drink prepared from a special plant and partaken of as a part of
the ritual service. Haoma has secured a prominent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the later Avestan
theology and forms an essential part of the Zoroastrian liturgy. Haoma
primarily is a plant of this world, from which the drink was quaffed as a
religious act, but the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> soon evolves into an angel of the same name
presiding over this plant. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> concepts are so closely interwoven that it
often becomes difficult to ascertain <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the Haoma occuring in a certain
<span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> is the genius of the plant of that name, or the plant itself. The same
difficulty is witnessed with reference to Soma in the Vedas. The
anthropomorphic character of both Haoma Soma is little pronounced. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span>
chapters of the Yasna and a Yasht mostly composed of excerpts from the
Yasna are dedicated to Haoma. More than 120 hymns are devoted to Soma
in Rig Veda. Ahura Mazda <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> for Haoma the star-bespangled <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

of the mountains,292 and from these heights he sacrifices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Drvaspa,

292 Y9.26.
293 Y57.19; Yt9.17, 18; 10.88; 17.37, 38.
Haoma pleads the greatness of his cult. He is anxious that his cult, which
has been in vogue for centuries, be given a due [205] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the new <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
and receive the sanction of the prophet. The poet depicts him as
approaching Zarathusbtra for this particular purpose. One morning, we are
informed, Haoma came to the prophet as he was chanting the sacred Gathas
before the fire-altar and asked him to seek his favour by consecrating the
Haoma juice for libations and to praise him as the other sages had praised
him.294 Vivasvant, Yama, and Trita Aptya were the first to <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span>
Soma. The Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the same persons who first offered
sacrifices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Haoma. In reply to Zarathushtra’s inquiry Haoma proceeds to
give instances of some of the greatest of his celebrants. The first among the
mortals to <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the angel Haoma by pounding the Haoma plant for

Haoma's due. Haoma is to be propitiated with sacrifice. Among other
objects animals were sacrificed in the Zoroastrian ritual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the angels, and
the different parts of the consecrated <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> were allotted to the various
Yazatas. The Pahlavi books elaborately treat the question of reserving
particular parts of the animal for the various Yazatas. We are told that Ahura
Mazda has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> apart for Haoma as his share in the <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> the jaw-bone, the

Haoma's curse. Haoma does not give <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> of priestly virtues to the
woman who wrongfully partakes of the sacred cake consecrated to him.311
Whosoever deprives Haoma of his portion in the sacrifice, displeases him,
and the penalty he pays for this slight to Haoma is that a priest, a warrior, or
a husbandman is not thereafter <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in his house.312 The faithful is exhorted
to propitiate him with his due portion, lest the offended angel should bind
him with heavy iron chains as he bound Franrasyan.313 Haoma pronounces
his curse of being childless and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> name and fame against those who, like

the arrogant Keresani from his throne.315

Haoma, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of plants.

on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> summits of Mount Hara Berezaiti, the modern Alburz.3l6
According to the Vedic texts, it grows on the mount Mujavat. The birds
carried it from there in all directions.3l7 An eagle <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it down, says the

spreading sweet perfume all around.319 It is of golden hue, say both, and the
celestial drink prepared from its branches is most invigorating and profitable
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of man.319a Indulgence in intoxicating beverages causes wrath and
strife, quarrel and confusion, but the drink of Haoma is accompanied by
righteousness and piety.320 It confers immortality. It is the source of
righteousness.321 Haoma grows in abundance when it is praised by man. The
pounding of the Haoma juice for <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is tantamount to the destruction of
the demons by thousands.322 Misery vanishes and happiness and health enter
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in which Haoma is prepared 323 The exhilarating drink gives

Haoma may reach them for the strength of their bodies.325 There is a close

DRVASPA

The female genius of cattle. She is a female genius of the animal world. As
the guardian of herds, she is invoked in company with Geush Tashan and
Geush Urvan.364 A Yasht (9) is consecrated to her and bears her name, or
more familiarly that of Gosh or Geush Urvan. Drvaspa moves about in her
own chariot of sounding wheels. Mazda has made her heroic and righteous.
She is the bestower of health <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the cattle and kine.

Her sacrificers. The Yasht gives a list of her supplicants who have asked her
to grant them various boons. They are the same persons that invoke Ashi
Vanghuhi and pray for the same boons that they ask from her. The only
difference between the [211] forms of invoking Drvaspa and Ashi is that no
<span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> is made to Ashi by any of her supplicants, whereas in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
Drvaspa we see that with the exception of Haoma and Zarathushtra the
other heroes, Haoshyangha, Yima. Thraetaona, Haosravah, and Vishtaspa,

offered by the Persians to the sun. A white horse of the best Nisaean breed
was selected for the <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to the sun.373 A white chariot, covered with
garlands was sacred to the sun.374 A temple consecrated to the sun, with a

USHAH
The female divinity of dawn. Ushah is identical with the Vedic Ushas, and
is the female divinity of the dawn in both religions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> coming down from
the common Indo-Iranian period. It is she who announces as the first glimpse
of light, to creation, the approach of dawn. Ushah's personality is very

faintly pronounced both in the Rig Veda and in the Younger Avestan texts.
The Vedic poets have, however, produced most exquisite lyric poetry in
praise of the dawn in about twenty hymns. There is only a short Avestan
hymn in prose composed to celebrate the dawn and even this has but six
lines devoted to the subject of the composition. Here she is described as
beautiful, resplendent, possessed of bright steeds, blessed, and heroic; and
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> illumines all the seven zones.404 Auxiliaries to Ushah are Ushahina
and Berejya and Nmanya. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Ushahina, who is also a male
personification of dawn, is the name of the fifth period of the day, and the
prayer consecrated to Ushah bears his name. The priest at the <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
undertakes to propitiate Ushahina by sacrifice, if he has in thought, word,
deed, or will offended him.405

TISHTRYA
The star genius directs the rain. Next in importance to the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon,
among the heavenly luminaries, are the countless stars. Among the stars that
are personified as objects of praise and reverence, the most prominent is the
radiant and glorious star Tishtrya. He is the star Sirius in the constellation of
Canis Major. The Yazata who impersonates this brilliant star bears naturally
also the same name. The Tishtrya Yasht (8) sings the <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of the twofold
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Tishtrya, both as star and as the Yazata that presides over it.
Tishtrya is, therefore, the rain-star, and the Yasht gives a lively picture of his
movements in producing clouds and rain and sleet, and distributing them
over all the world. Tishtrya's constant companions are the starYazatas,
named Vanant, Satavaesa, and Haptoiringa, as guardian spirits of different
regions of the heavens.406 The thirteenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the month406a and the fourth

glorious.' He is the giver of fertility to the fields,407 the giver of happy and

the exalted one.408 He is possessed of the seed of the waters, the valiant, the
courageous, far reaching, the efficient,409 and of sound eyes.410 Ahura Mazda
has appointed Tishtrya as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of all other stars, even as he has ordained

as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of invocation, as worthy of propitiation, and
as worthy of glorification as himself.412 According to Plutarch he is
established as a scout over all other stars.413

last ten nights in the shape of a white beautiful horse.415 In accordance with
the will of Ahura Mazda and the archangels, he traverses the most distant
parts of the earth,416 and the Iranian countries <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> for his advent, for it is

Men and beasts, the waters and all, look eagerly to the rising of the star
Tishtrya, as he will send a flood of rain to fertilize their waste lands with

praise and worship.418 The farmer yearns for a few drops of Tishtrya's rain to
moisten his parched fields, the gardener longs for a shower to brighten the
foliage. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> smiles with rich harvests as a result of his fertilizing waters.

prosperity to the country.424 Ahura Mazda, the Amesha Spentas, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as

this war of the elements for the benefit of mankind425

VANANT
A star-Yazata. The other important star-Yazata besides Tishtrya who is
classed among the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is Vanant. The twentieth Yasht is
composed in his honour. Tradition assigns to him the special <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of

stars revolve, and accounts him as the leader of a constellation in the western
heavens in the war against the planets. In the Avestan Yasht bearing this star-

Yazata's name, Vanant is specially invoked to give help to smite the noxious
creatures of Angra Mainyu.426 Some spells to this effect, composed in the
Pazend language, are later appended to this particular Yasht. It is elsewhere
stated in the Avesta that Ahura Mazda has created him,427 and that the
faithful ask him for strength and victory to enable them to remove distress
and tyranny.427a

SATAVAESA
An acolyte of Tishtrya. The star Satavaesa is also personified, but his
individuality is very faintly pronounced. He has no Yasht or hymn composed
to glorify him. As an acolyte of Tishtrya, he causes the waters of the sea
Vourukasha to flow down to the seven zones for the nourishment of plants
and animals, and for the fertility and prosperity of the Aryan nations.428
428 Yt8.9; 13.43; Sr. 1.13; 2.13.
HAPTOIRINGA
Another acolyte of Tishtrya. This constellation, Ursa Major, is also raised to
the position of a lesser divinity. Ninety-nine <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> nine hundred and
ninety-nine Fravashis watch over this stellar cluster.429 The genius of this star
is invoked to enable mankind to oppose the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> caused by the sorcerers and

VAYU

The deification of the wind. Vayu, or Vata, is the Indo-Iranian
impersonation of wind. The terms Vayu and Vata are variously <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to
represent either the wind or the genius of wind in both the Rig Veda and in
the Avestan texts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> Vayu is chiefly the personification of the wind. As we
have already seen, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the Ram Yasht treats of the exploits of
Raman's comrade Vayu. Vayu's wind is divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parts, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and
the evil. The wind is productive of good, but it also causes harm. That part
of Vayu which is supposed to be the source of harm is branded as evil, and
classed among Angra Mainyu's creations. Hence the faithful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care to

Mainyu.431 The twenty-second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the month is named after Vayu.432

Vayu’s attributes. The genius of wind is most frequently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'working on
high.' He strikes terror among all, and [220] fearlessly enters the deepest and
the darkest places to smite the demons.433 He is high-girt, of strong stature,
of <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> foot, of wide breast, of broad thighs, and of powerful eyes.434 He
wears a golden helm and a golden crown, a golden necklace, and golden
garment; he has golden shoes and a golden girdle; and armed with golden
weapons he rides in a golden chariot rolling on golden wheels.435 A fine
image this, to immortalize Vayu in a golden statue! The poet gives a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> list
of the names of Vayu, and is very prolific in ascribing <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> attributes to him.
In this the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> composer follows the Yasht dedicated to Ahura Mazda. In
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> Vayu is the only angel who is known, like Ahura Mazda, by many
names. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> enumerates about forty-seven of such titles. Almost all of
these attributes of Vayu are derived from the function of Vayu as wind,
rather than from his activity as the genius of wind. They pertain to the
atmospheric phenomenon more than to the abstract ideas about the angel.
Some of the more important of the names of Vayu are as follows: the
overtaker, the all-vanquishing, the good-doer, the one going forwards and
backwards, the destroyer, smiter, usurper, the most valiant, the strongest, the
firmest, the stoutest, the vanquisher at one stroke, the destroyer of malice,
the liberator, the pervading one, and the glorious.436

the battle, or when the tyrant and heretic threaten him with their havocking
hordes.

invoked Vayu and begged of him various boons, and in this connection we
may recall that Herodotus438 mentions the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the Persians sacrificed to
the winds among other <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> forces in nature. The list of Vayu's supplicants
in Yasht 15 is headed by Ahura Mazda himself, who desired the boon that he
may smite the creatures of Angra Mainyu, but that none may smite the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of Spenta Mainyu.439 Among the kings, renowned heroes. and other

litany is composed in honour of Atar and he is celebrated many other
passages. The ninth month of the year and the ninth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the month are

tomb shows an altar with <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> on it. Herodotus, the earliest of the Greek
writers on Persia, however, informs us that the Persians did not erect temples
in his days, but sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the elements sun, moon, earth, fire, water,
and wind on the summits of mountains.448 Dino, the contemporary of
Alexander, does not mention the fire-temples and says that the Persians

worshipped in the open air.449 It may be that the early writers did not come
across temples in Iran, in the Greek <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the term. But there must
certainly have been some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of structures to protect the sacred <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> from

What causes grief to Atar. Angra Mainyu has created the inexpiable crime of
burning or cooking dead matter,478 and the Vendidad enjoins capital
punishment for those who commit it.479 We are informed that the Persians

ARDVI SURA ANAHITA
The angel of waters. Ardvi Sura, who bears the standing epithet anâhita,
'undefiled,' is the name of a mythical river as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that of the female
divinity of the waters. She resides in the starry regions.493 This deity of the
heavenly stream gets recognition of the Achaemenian kings, and is included
in the extremely short list of the Iranian divinities expressly mentioned in
their inscriptions.494 Classical writers <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of her sanctuaries founded at
Pasargadae, Ecbatana, Kangavar and other places.495 At a very early date her
cult migrates to distant countries and is there assimilated to Artemis,
Aphrodite, Athene-Minerva, Hera, Magna Mater, Ishtar, and Nanaia.496 She
overleaps the barriers [226] of Mount Alburz and gains her votaries in the
far-off lands of East and West, where occasionally her cult degenerates into
obscene rites. Herodotus who confuses her with Mithra says that her cult
came to Iran from the Semites of Assyria and Arabia.497 493 Yt5.85, 88, 132.

maiden of fair body, well-shaped, pure, courageous, tall, bright, beautiful,

Ahura Mazda heads the list of the sacrificers who entreat her for various

boons. The Yasht dedicated to Ardvi Sura Anahita furnishes us with the
names of those who have sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> her and begged of her various
boons. The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of her supplicants exceeds that of any other angel. Ahura
Mazda and Zarathushtra invoke her, with Haoma and Baresman, with spells
[227] and libations, whereas the majority of her other votaries severally offer
her a hundred stallions, a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> oxen, and ten <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> sheep.

sorcerers and fairies, the fiends and the demons; they pray likewise for bodily
health, <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> to answer the riddles of heretics, and for riches and swift
horses.505 The boon that Ahura Mazda seeks is that he may win over
Zarathushtra to think after his reljgion, to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> after his religion, and to act
after his religion; the prophet in turn begs of her that he may gain to his side
the mighty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Vishtaspa as a patron to embrace his religion.506 The rulers
and chiefs invoke her that they may defeat their enemies and smite the
demons, sorcerers, and fairies, the warriors beg of her swift horses and bodily
health and glory, the priests and their disciples pray for knowledge, the
maids beseech her to grant them strong husbands.507 Ardvi Sura Anahita
bestows fruitfulness to women; she purifies the seeds of all males and the
wombs of all females for bearing. Shes, as a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> bestower, gives easy

likewise grants boons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> all, because it lies in her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to do so. The
sacrificing priest implores her to come down from the stars to the sacrificial
altar, and to grant riches, horses, chariots, swords, food, and plenty to
men.509 She gives health and increases flocks, possessions, and wealth.510

She reluses to concede the wicked persons their wishes. Azhi Dahaka
wickedly besought her to grant him a boon that he may make all the seven
zones empty of men, and the Turanian Franrasyan sought her favour to
secure the Glory, and the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">sons</span> of Vaesaka implored her to grant that they
may smite the Aryan [228] nation by tens of thousands and myriads; Arejataspa and Vandaremainish craved for the defeat of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Vishtaspa, Zairivairi,

The offerings of libations. Ardvi Sura Anahita desires that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> invoke her
with libations and Haoma;512 these libations are to be drunk by the priest
who is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> versed in religious lore, and not by any wicked and deformed

not reach her; on the contrary, they go to the demons, who revel in these
misdirected offerings.514 We are informed that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who dedicates these
libations before sunrise or after sunset does no better deed than if he should
pour them down into the jaws of a venomous snake.515 Besides invoking
Ardvi Sura Anahita as the Yazata of water, the waters themselves are
collectively invoked to grant boons. Zarathushtra is asked to offer a libation
to the waters and to ask from them riches, power, and worthy offspring,516 a
happy and a joyful abode in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the next, accompanied by riches
and glory.517 The faithful pray that these waters may not be for those of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

Animal sacrifices to Anahita. Strabo relates the mode of sacrificing to the
waters. The sacrificial animal, we are told, is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to the bank of a river or a
lake; a ditch is formed into which the animal is killed. The pieces of meat are
then placed on myrtle or laurel, and holding tamarisk twigs in his hands, the
priest pours oil mixed with honey and milk on the ground and chants the
sacred formulas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> care is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> that no drop [229] of blood falls into the

honey, and milk be poured into water.521 This precaution is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> lest the
waters be defiled.

Any defilement of the waters evokes Ardvi Sura's displeasure. It is sinful to
contaminate the waters. Such an act incurs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> displeasure on the part of

become unclean for ever and ever.522 If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> while walking or running,

Ardvi Sura's chariot. Like some of the Yazatas, Ardvi Sura Anahita has a
chariot of her own, in which she drives forth in majesty. She holds the reins
in her own hands, and controls four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> chargers who are all of white color,
of the same stock, and who smite the malice of all tyrants, demons, wicked

regarding the steeds that are yoked to her chariot, for we are told that the
four chargers of Ardvi Sura are the wind, the rain, the cloud, and the sleet;

to have been eclipsed by Anahita, who remains the chief genius presiding
over waters in the cult. Apam Napat's Vedic counterpart has an aqueous as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as an igneous nature. In the association of the Avestan Apam Napat with

Apam Napat literally means 'the offspring of waters,' and, like [230] the
Vedic genius, lives beneath the waters.528 He is the exalted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and
sovereign, the shining one, and the swift-horsed.529 The waters are addressed
as females. Apam Napat in the Vedas is nourished by females.530 The Avestan
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of him as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of females.531 He is the most prompt to
respond when invoked,532 and co-operates with Vayu and distributes the

waters on earth.533 He furthers the riches of the countries and allays
misfortunes;534 and when the Kingly <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">Glory</span> escapes from the contest of Atar
and Azhi Dahaka to the sea Vourukasha it is Apam Napat who takes and
protects it.535 This Yazata is also credited with having made and shaped
men.536

memory,17 and the first month of the Iranian calendar
receives its name after them.
The Fravashis, we have seen, resemble the Vedic
Pitrs, the Roman Manes, or the Platonic Ideas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span>

after all, they are not wholly the same as these. The

stubborn problem to students of Iranian theology.
Primarily, the Fravashis constitute a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of
homonyms of the earthly creations, and they have
lived as conscious <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the empyrean with Ahura
Mazda from all eternity. The multifarious objects of
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are so many terrestrial duplicates of these
celestial originals. The Fravashis constitute the
internal essence of things, as opposed to the
contingent and accidental. Earthly creations are so
many imperfect copies of these types. They are the
manifestations of the energy of Ahura Mazda. When
nothing existed and Ahura Mazda lived in his sublime
singleness, he had the ideas, concepts of the material
and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> which he contemplated
creating in time. We have recognized the projection
and manifestation of his will and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and the
emanation of his creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as Spenta Mainyu.
Origen, the Alexandrian philosopher, is right when
he says that the Logos represents the sum total of the
world-thoughts of God. Spenta Mainyu is the

embodiment of Ahura Mazda’s prototypal ideas
which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Fravashis in the Avestan texts.
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Creation</span> is the materialization of these idealized

when he smites Aka Manah that stands for his

[237] During the lifetime of the individual, his

the present in body, mind, and spirit; and the present

Ahura Mazda himself is a Bagha.3 Baga, the cognate
of the Avestan Bagha, is most freely applied to
Auramazda in the Old Persian Inscriptions. He is the
greatest of all Bagas.4 Besides ithe supreme godhead,
Mithra is expressly mentioned as a Baga.5 This does
not exhaust the list of the Baghas, for, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> not

Greek writers, who, we can safely assert, were

malicious thoughts and teachings, his intellect and
faith, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and deeds, and in conscience and

Mainyu determines to overthrow such <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> on the
part of the prophet to whom he is so opposed, and
resolves to wreak vengeance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. He clamours

DAEVAS
The Demons. The daevas, or demons, are of both
sexes, as are their heavenly counterparts. Over
against the vispe Yazata, or 'all angels,' stand in sharp
contradistinction the vispe Daeva, 'all demons.'42 The
greatest of all the demons is Angra Mainyu,43 who
has created these fiends in opposition to the [262]
Yazatas. The archangelic host of the Amesha
Spentas, and some of the angel band of Yazatas have
each a Daeva as a special adversary engaged in
thwarting the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will. Plutarch states that when
Oromazdes created the six archangels, Areimanios
counter-created an equal <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of fiends.44 The
arrangement, however, is perfunctory, if we examine
the Younger Avestan text. The personality of the
majority of these demons is not sharply defined, and
the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their activities, as found in the Later
Avestan texts, is very vague and meagre. Some are
mentioned simply by name, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
their function being added; it is only through the
help of the Pahlavi literature that we can get a more
definite <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the infernal group. Not
only are the wicked spirits spoken of as the Daevas,
but also the nomadic hordes of Gilan and
Mazanderan, realms designated as Mazainya in the
Avesta, that constantly burst with their infidel hordes
of invaders into the settlements of the faithful,
menacing their properties, devastating their fields,

Daevas.45 The wicked sodomite is equally a daeva,
and a worshipper of daevas, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as a paramour of
daevas; he is a daeva during life, and remains a daeva
after death.46 All moral wrongs and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> obstacles
are personified and catalogued in this scheme of
demonology. To every disease is assigned its own
demon as having been the cause of the malady. The
germs of disease and death, of plague and pestilence,
are spoken of metaphorically as Daevas. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> of

is said that if the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> were not to rise, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of

the cover of darkness, the Daevas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> kill all living
beings.48 In connection with such ideas of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of evil, it may be understood that the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
teach that the ground wherein are interred the
corpses of the dead is infested with myriads of the
demons, who feed and revel on the spot as a
consequence, for such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is their favourite
haunt.49 Even the dropping of nails and hair on the
ground is an act of [263] uncleanness that is
equivalent to <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> a <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to the demons, as
spirits of pollution. Such a careless act of uncleanness
results in the production of demoniacal foes to health
and purity such as lice and moths, which are equally
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the daevas.50 The northern regions are peopled
with the demons.51 They are evil, bereft of good, illbehaved, evil-doing, worst liars, most loathsome, and
most wicked.52
The <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the demons is said to be legion, even

Those who strike terror into the hearts of the
demons. Ahura Mazda is invoked to smite the
demons,61 and Haurvatat, Ardvi Sura, Drvaspa, and
the Fravashis are invoked by the [264] kings and
heroes to the same end.62 Asha Vahishta smites the

In her burrows gathered the demons.91 It is through
the help of the religion of Mazda that the Druj can
be driven away from the world; this is expressly the
saying of Ahura Mazda to his prophet.92 At the final
renovation Saoshyant, the saviour, will overcome the
Druj among mankind;93 she will then perish utterly
and forever with her hundred-fold brood.94

Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> Druj [267] becomes a class designation
of minor female demons. These fiends are styled the
Drujes, and Yt2.11 speaks of vispe druj, 'all drujes,' in
the same strain as vispe Yazata, 'all Yazatas,' and vispe
daeva, 'all demons.' From the sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> we learn
that there are drujes who come openly, and there are
those that come in secret, and again there are those
that defile by mere contact.95-96 The term druj itself is

BUSHYANSTA
Sloth personified. Idleness and inactivity tend to
strengthen the Kingdom of Evil. The demoness
Bushyansta, or sloth personified, literally
'procrastination,' is commissioned by Angra Mainyu
to inculcate the habit of sleep and procrastination
among mankind. She, the long-handed, as she is
called,139 lulls the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to inordinate

comes off first as the victor in the combat and puts
the genius of rain to flight.156 Tishtrya bemoans his
lot and complains before Ahura Mazda that mankind
had neglected to <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> him. If only he were

himself on the battlefield the vigour of ten horses,
ten camels, ten bulls, ten mountains, and ten rivers.157
Ahura Mazda, thereupon, offers a <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to the
unfortunate angel and gives him the desired
strength.158 Girt with this added power, Tishtrya now
boldly marches against his rival, and engages in
combat with him, until, to the joy of the waters, and
plants, and lands, and fields, Tishtrya comes out
triumphant and Apaosha is defeated.159

As the source of man's actions is desire, it is <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span>

Yajnavalkya says that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is altogether desire. Karma

elongate the chain of rebirths. The ideal of life,
therefore, is to divest oneself of Karma. Actions

In common with the various schools of philosophy
current at the time, the Gita propounds the theories
of rebirth and Karma. Krishna undertakes to teach
how one bas to perform actions and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to save

According to Judaism, Yahweh searches the hearts of

CHAPTER XXIX
THE RENOVATION
The greatest of the renovators. Zoroaster in his
religion postulated a renovation of the universe, a
new dispensation in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will become
perfect at the last day. We learn from Diogenes, on
the authority of Theopompus and Eudemus, that the
classical authors were familiar with the Magian
doctrine of the millennium and the final restoration

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as early as in the fourth century B.C.1

doctrine from Theopompus.2 In the Later Avestan
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> we sometimes miss a clear definition of the
collective judgment of the souls and final
regeneration. But they furnish us with some stray
passages which cursorily deal with the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the

renovators who will <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> this to pass.

and wrong are to be ultimately supplanted by equity
and right. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to be restored to a veritable

makes it imperative that the entire <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> shall
finally be saved. The faithful are confident of this

According to the teachings of Zarathushtra, every
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or woman is his or her own saviour. Salvation
depends entirely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the righteous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the
individual. Besides the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> salvation there is to
be the universal salvation in which the renovators
[289]will finish the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of bringing salvation to all

that will usher in this period. These are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Saoshyants in the Zoroastrian terminology. The
Fravardin Yasht5 mentions Ukhshyatereta, Ukhshyatnemah, and Astvatereta as the chief renovators.
Zarathushtra's own kith and kin, a superman of
miraculous powers, <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in supernatural manner, will
finally descend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to renovate the world.
Astvatereta, or the Saoshyant proper, will be
immaculately conceived through a virgin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Vispataurvi, or 'the all-triumphant.'6 He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Saoshyant because he will salvage the bodily world,
and Astvatereta because he will save the bodily
creatures from destruction at the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of the twofooted wicked ones.7 Astvatereta is reflected in the
Gathic expression astvat ashem, ashem being cognate
with areta.8 This Saoshyant par excellence is the most
eminent restorer, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the friend of Ahura
Mazda, the meritorious one, who will <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> the

as just stated, incidentally mentions Zarathushtra's
seed as watched over by ninety-nine <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> nine
hundred and ninety-nine Fravashis. Passages such as
these in the Avesta contain in embryo the doctrine of
the immaculate birth which is later elaborated by the
Pahlavists.
This final Saoshyant will be helped in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

Disintegration followed almost immediately after

Jess than a century had elapsed before Arsaces
succeeded in founding a strong empire in Parthia

undercurrents of the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> among the
Zoroastrians during this period. From what little
information we get we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that in the Parthians
Zoroastranism found better masters than in the
Seleucids. Mithradates, Tiridates, Rhodaspes, and
Artabanus are some of the names of the Parthian
kings that savour of a partiality for Zoroastrianism.
The Magi exercised a considerable influence at the
Parthian court. They had their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the council of

were strongly influenced by Zoroastrianism in their
religious beliefs.7 They venerated the sacred
elements, especially the fire, worshipped the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span>

Zoroastrianism spreads its influence abroad. The
Magi had established themselves during the Parthian
period in large numbers in eastern Asia Minor,
Galatia, Phrygia, Lydia, and even in [296] Egypt.
These colonies of the Zoroastrian priests became an
active source of the diffusion of the Zoroastrian
beliefs.16 The rulers of the dynasties established in

MITHRAISM
Mithraism is Zoroastrianism contaminated with
Semitic accretions. Of all the Indo-Iranian divinities,
Mithra attained to the greatest prominence during
this period. The Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> constantly <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of
Mithra as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of wide pastures, and Mithra
gathered the largest <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of flocks under his
protection in the field of spirit. Iranian in its basic
principles, Mithra's cult was soon surcharged with
Semitic accretions and spread far and wide under this
new syncretic form. The Achaemenian kings lived
during winter in Babylonia. Here the Chaldaean

Ahriman or Pluto, according to Mithraism, is <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span>
like Ormazd of Boundless Time, and lives deep down
in hell. He assaulted the heavens with his infernal
crew, but was repulsed and driven back to hell.

Mithra combats the primeval Bull. His painful
struggle with the Bull symbolizes the sufferings of
mankind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. He triumphs over the Bull and
puts him in a cave where at the command of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Sun</span>
he ultimately kills him reluctantly, that he may
thereby create and save mankind. The moon gathers
and purifies the seed and the different kinds of

the protection of the dog, the faithful companion of

to kill it, as he had previously struggled to kill the
Bull. He causes pestilential scourges and protracted
drought but is baftled in his aim. He then causes a
universal deluge, from which one man, forewarned by
God, makes a boat for himself and his cattle and is
saved. Then follows a huge conflagration which

Mithraic ethics. In Rome, Mithraism is the religion of
the emperors and soldiers and Mithra exalts active,
rigorous, military virtues. He is himself ever wakeful
and demands wakefulness, agility in his votaries. He
is the divinity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and justice and he guards
them, fights against falsehood and injustice and
requires that his worshippers will practise these

[306] existence and assures them of salvation in the
next. There is the esoteric side of Mithraism in which
the aspirants to the Mithraic mysteries had to
practise strict self-control. The neophytes had to
undergo repeated lustrations and ablutions to cleanse
their souls of sin. They had to live austere lives and
perform elaborate occult ceremonies most
scrupulously. There were seven degrees of initiation
in which the mystic successively assumed the names
of Raven, Occult, Soldier, Lion, Persian, Runner of
the Sun, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> and put on sacred marks

appropriate to the names. He was made to undergo
these seven degrees of initiation to enable him to
acquire <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> and holiness. Only those that passed
through all the seven degrees became participants in
the mysteries.
The Mithraic sanctuaries were in caves and grottoes.

recesses of the subterranean crypts. The heavens
were believed to be a solid vault and became
symbolic of Mithra <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> from the rock. Greek <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span>
was enlisted in the service of Mithraism. Mithraic
monuments represent in stone Mithra in the act of
immolating the Bull, Mithraic legends, cosmogony,

are dragged to hell by Ahriman and submitted to
untold tortures.
There are seven heavens one above the other. These
spheres are conjoined to the seven planets. A ladder
takes the pious souls from one story to another.
When the souls have traversed the seven zones, they
enter the last paradisaic abode of <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and

recognize one another. Mithra will separate the

Christianity triumphs over Mithraism. The Jews had
settled in large numbers in the Roman cities. Paul, a
disciple of Jesus, travelled far and wide to preach his
master's faith. The religions of the East had for <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

Besides the
Mithraic mysteries, the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of Isis and Osiris
from <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> and the mysteries of various other
systems were popular among the masses. Cultured

Rome. They drew their inspiration from Greek
philosophy, reproduced in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of Cicero and
Seneca. This Hellenistic-Roman philosophy was
gradually losing its hold on those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

the earthly to the heavenly world, a supersensuous
world, presiding over by a divinity who prescribed
principles of moral conduct with <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> authority and

the belief in the future life. Christianity made it its
fundamental doctrine, and entered Rome with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>

assurance of future recompense. The teachings of the

new religion were eagerly listened to by the common
people. New converts refused to pay <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> homage
to the emperor as was the prevailing custom in Rome.
They were persecuted, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of followers
steadily grew. Periodical persecutions of the new sect
drove many to martyrdom and after bitter struggle it
gained a firm footing. The Roman empire was now
on the decline. Christianity rose in influence after the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Marcus Aurelius. It won a legal recognition
during the early part of the fourth century. A century
after Constantine, the Church became all-powerful.
The disciples of <span class="t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t15 t18 t19 t22 t26 t27 hoverable">Jesus</span> won the Roman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with the
gospel of love. By taking over the Hellenistic-Roman
philosophy, they worked out a rational dogmatic
theology that could satisfy both the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and the
intellect.
The conversion of Constantine to Christianity was a
turning [308] point in the destinies of Mithraism.
The cult ceased to be recognized and was tolerated
to exist. Hostility against it began under his
successors and persecution followed. A reaction
followed under Julian the Apostate (A.D. 361-363),
who was initiated in the mysteries of Mithra in his
youth and who considered himself under the
protection of Mithra. He openly passed elaborate
purificatory ablutions to wipe out the stains he had
contracted when he had received the baptism and the
communion of Christianity. As soon as he ascended
the throne, he introduced Mithraic <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> at
Constantinople and celebrated the first taurobolia at
Athens. He was the last pagan to occupy the throne
of the Caesars, the last who was an ardent worshipper
of Mithra. His premature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> put an end to the
reactionary movement. The victory of Theodosius in
394 A.D. extinguished all hopes of its revival by the

aristocracy that was still faithful to the cult.
Mithraism, which had originated among the enemies
of Rome, remained her religion for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hundred
years. It fell when it lost the protection of the State.

Miracles as credentials of a prophet's mission as
God's messenger. Credulity creates miracles. They
are due to man's hunger for the marvellous, his
disposition to believe in the impossible, and his
readiness to give credence to the incredible. They
flourish where childlike innocence, ignorance is
ready to be duped and deluded. The <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of the
masses rests on the foundation of signs and prodigies,
portents and miracles. Perternatural interference with

particularly the five centuries of chaos that followed
Alexander's conquest of Persia. The piety of the
adherents of his <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> has burnt so much incense in
his sacred memory that his <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> has got almost
beyond recognition. We know everything of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and Jesus; we know practically nothing of the

authentic; they are legendary and mythical. Portents
herald his birth and archangels attend his nativity.
Legendary accounts of the miraculous conception
and birth and childhood of Zaratusht supersede the
matter-of-fact information that the Gathas give. The
Pahlavi writers have before them the examples of the
legendary stories of the miraculous incidents
connected with the lives of Moses, Buddha, and
Jesus, circulated in Iran by the followers of these
prophets. It is probable that their writings have been
influenced by these foreign sources.

the early Greek and Roman writers. Some of them
have been influenced by what they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> from the

that it is from the practice introduced by him that
peoples conduct their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> rites in caves and

In all ages when everybody lives for himself there is
somebody [314]who lives for all. That somebody in
the settlements of Pourushasp was Zaratusht, who
chose to live for all. From chidhood, kindliness,
sympathy, mercy, and generosity had <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> their
marks on his face. He radiated benevolence around
him. He shed joy and happiness on all who came
near him, and communicated his goodness to them.
He had boundless sympathy and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for all the poor
and could not bear to see them suffer. He had keen
ears for the suppressed sighs and silent sorrows of
suffering humanity. He practised liberality and
generosity, he nourished the poor, and gave fodder
to cattle, he saved the lives of those in peril of losing
it.22 According to the custom of the times,, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span>

he rested awhile on a solitary plain, when he saw in a

heavenly premier of Ormazd. He accosted Zaratusht
and asked him who he was and what was his desire.
Zaratusht thereupon gave him his acquaintance and
said that he was in search of righteousness and added
that he was not only in quest of righteousness but
also of the very source from which righteousness
originates. Vohuman readily acquiesced and said that

Zaratusht followed. As they walked together,
Zaratusht saw that Vohuman was as tall as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

Ardashir, a Magus, rejuvenates Zoroastrianism. With the fall of the

homogeneous people, thinking with one mind, feeling with one heart, and
acting with one aim. As already pointed out, the Magi did not receive
recognition in the Avesta. It is not so in the Pahlavi period. The Avestan
term athravan remains during this era as a class designation alone, but
magopat, which later becomes mobad, is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> throughout the Pahlavi
literature, equally as a class designation for priesthood and as a personal title
of a priest to distinguish him from a layman. Significant in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> becomes
the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that although the Persians of old had defeated the Medes and their

he succeeded in [319] consolidating the various states of Iran into one

This greatly
elevated the position of the Zoroastrians at the royal court of Bagdad.
During this period it was that the composition of the Pahlavi treatises was
undertaken with renewed vigour. To the ninth century we owe much of the
Pahlavi literature that has come down to us. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the Pahlavi literature
covers a period of about seven centuries, beginning [321] from the first

Sasanian ruler, Ardashir, or still earlier, and stretching downwards to the
times of the illustrious Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty, al-Ma'mun, or even
later. The invention of the modern Persian alphabet restricted the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
Pahlavi to the learned clerics, who continued to make some slight additions
to the Pahlavi literature up to the end of the eleventh century.11
11. West, Pahlavi Literature, in GIrPh. 2. 80. The Pahlavi literature has its
roots in the Avestan soil. The Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> allege that the Avestan Nasks
had perished, but the tradition transmitted orally from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and the
fragments of the sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> did not suffer the Avestan lore to die out
entirely. The extant Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> contain quotations from Avestan <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span>
that have not come down to us, and this may help to show that the later
writers either quoted from memory or that they had access to Avestan works,
since lost, when they wrote their Pahlavi treatises; or possibly it may serve to
prove both facts. Nay, some of the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> seem to be wholly or in
part reproductions of some of the Avesta Nasks, and most scholars agree
with West that the Pahlavi Bundahishn is an epitome of the Avestan Damdad
Nask, that has since disappeared.12 This leads to the probable conclusion
that besides the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> archetype copies deposited in the royal treasuries at
Persepolis and Samarkand, there may have existed other copies of these
Nasks, in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> or in part, in private possession or in the more notable firetemples. The internal evidence of some of the most important Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span>
show us that they preserve much of the material derived from Avestan
sources, which still existed in their days, but has been subsequently lost, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> make up for the loss of the original Avestan books to a considerable extent.
12. SBE., vol. 5. int. xxiv. The Pahlavi literature is the completion of the
Avestan works. The Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> explain, elaborate, and describe in detail
much of what is stated in brief in the original Avestan texts. This is the
inestimable value of the Pahlavi literature. A few examples may serve to
illustrate this statement. The Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> frequently mention 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Long</span> Duration,' a period carved out from eternity as the age for the duration
of the present world, but give no idea, as far as the <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> have been
preserved, as to the length of this mighty aeon. It is to [322] the Pahlavi
books that we have to turn to ascertain the specific duration of this period,

for the millennial doctrine is recognized but not described in the Avestan
writings that we possess today. It is worked out in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> detail in the Pahlavi
works. This <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> might even suggest that the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> originated with the
Pahlavists but such is not the case, for we know from Plutarch that
Theopompus, who flourished in the fourth century B.C., or a little before the
close of the Avestan period, was <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> acquainted with this doctrine of the
Zoroastrians, and wrote about it in his works.13 13. Is. et Os. 47. The Later
Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the future judgment, the rising of the dead, the
renovation, but it is the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that acquaint us with the method of
the administration of justice in the heavenly tribunal and the final restoration
of the universe.
The <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the Younger Avesta, as noted above, <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of different heavens
and hells, but the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> locate them, and give a detailed description
of the area they cover, the boundaries that divide them from one another,
and the conditions that prevail in them.
The trend of the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of the Pahlavi period. We have
described the change from the Gathic to the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> as a retrograde
step; the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are still farther removed from the Gathas. The Gathic
ideal lingers and continues to be admired, but it has ceased to influence. It
evokes praise from the Pahlavi writers, but fails to inspire them with its
abstract tone. Zoroaster is a historical personage in the Gathas. In the Later
Avesta he becomes super-human; but in the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> his personality is
enshrouded by miracles, and he is transformed into a myth. The fascination
for marvels in religion is an unmistakable sign of the times. Christian
bishops, who, as we shall see in the further stage of our inquiry, carried on
inveterate disputes with the Zoroastrian clergy in Persia, based the claim of
the greatness of their own religion on miracles. Perhaps in consequence the
life-story of Zoroaster, as told by the writers of the Pahlavi period, is
similarly stamped with the mark of the miraculous. The Gathas and the
Younger Avesta <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the prophet's conferences with the Amshaspands,
or archangels, and his communing with them. The Pahlavi texts, as we have
seen, <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> [323]that they came to the court of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Gushtasp as the envoys
of Ormazd, to give proof of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> calling of the prophet. Moreover,
when Zoroaster met Vohuman, he actually saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of the
archangel, his size, and his garments, and in these celestial conferences with

the archangels the prophet was requested by each in turn to command
mankind to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> due care of the concrete <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> under the special charge of
each as an Amshaspand and not the abstract virtue that each impersonates.
Vohuman, for instance, as the genius of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> mind, did not emphasize the
faithful adherence to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> thoughts, but contented himself with reminding
the prophet to teach mankind to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care of the cattle. Artavahisht, the
genius of righteousness, gave no command to Zaratusht to exhort <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to
follow the path of righteousness, but taught him that the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of
propitiating the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> was to propitiate his fire. Similarly the other
archangels in these celestial interviews did not hold up as the ideals the
virtues over which they presided, but they inculcated due preservation of
their respective earthly objects. A Pazend penitential prayer, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
authorship is attributed to Dastur Adarbad Mahraspand, the high-priest and
premier of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Shapur (309-379 a.d.), mentions the Amshaspands by name,
and exhorts the penitent to atone severally for the sins committed against
them. In every <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> he addresses each archangel in turn and craves
forgiveness for any offence that may have been committed by ill-treating the
earthly <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> over which the genius presides. Offences against the abstract
virtues which the archangels impersonate are not meniiored in this treatise,14
and this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> tends decidedly to show that phase of Zoroastrianism in which
abstract ideas were gradually losing in importance, and the concrete side of
the religion was coming out with greater prominence. 14. Pt. 8. This process
of materializing the original abstract concepts reaches its climax in the
eschatological notions of this period. The several heavens and hells, as also
the bridge of judgment that leads to them, are now completely materialized.
All the splendours of a royal court with its golden thrones, rich carpets, fine
cushions are transferred to paradise. On the other hand, all sorts of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
tortures that man's ingenuity can devise prevail in hell. [324] Fifteen hundred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> separated Zoroaster from the Sasanian period, and a thick veil began to
hide the pristine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religion from his followers.
The Sasanian Church became an arbiter of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Zoroaster. It was
through the Church that the religious teachings filtered into the populace.
During the period of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> influence, when the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">State</span> was practically
under her tutelage, the Church rendered a lasting service by her attempts to
reinvigorate the Mazdayasnian faith. She triumphed when she stood for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the religion of Mazda; but she failed when she descended to rigid

formalism, stifled independent inquiry, stigmatized honest doubt as
Ahrimanian, and sought to overrule original thinking by dogmatic assertions.
Religion defeats its own ends when it degenerates into dogmatic theology.
And it was not otherwise in Persia.

THE ACTIVE PROPAGANDA OF THE <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">FAITH</span>
The Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> on proselytism. Zaratusht first preached his new religion
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Iran where he was born; but Ormazd has commanded that
the excellent religion should be spread among all races of mankind
throughout the world.1 In their commentary on the oft-recurring Avestan
formula fravarâne, the Pahlavi versionists add an explanatory gloss that every
believer undertakes to proclaim the Zoroastrian religion of Ormazd to the
entire world. It is said that the act of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> merit that a non-believer
can perform in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is to his religion and embrace the Mazdayasnian
faith.2 The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Sasanian monarch, Shapur II, zealously worked for the
restoration and promulgation of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> among the unbelievers with the aid
of his illustrious Dastur Adarbad.3 The Denkard sanctions even the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
force for the conversion of the aliens.4 A Pahlavi treatise devoted mostly to
the Zoroastrian rituals attests the practice of admitting outsiders into the
Zoroastrian fold.5 Another Pahlavi tractate treating of the social and legal
practices of the Sasanians lays down that if a Christian slave embraces the
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of his Zoroastrian master, he should be given freedom.

in the fifth century A.D., in his historical <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> states that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Yazdagard II
and his royal court resorted to both persuasion and force in their attempt to
win over the Christians of Armenia to Zoroastrianism.7 The [326] Christian
subjects of the Persian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> in Armenia, we are informed, were promised
<span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> positions, court distinctions, royal favours, and the remission of the
taxes, if they accepted the national <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Iran. Mihr Narsih, the premier of
Yazdagard II (A.D. 438-457), in the proclamation to the Christian
population in Armenia that he issued at the royal command, exhorts them to
adopt the religion that their sovereign holds, and adds that those that do not
acknowledge the Mazdayasnian <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> are deaf and blind, and are misled by
Ahriman.8 Elisaeus informs us that this proselytizing movement on the part
of the Magi of Sasanian times was not confined to Armenia alone, but it
extended further to Georgia, Albania, and various other countries.9

formidable rivals of the national faith. When the Zoroastrian Church was

religious supremacy was challenged at home by Judaism, and more
aggressively by Christianity.10 Ardashir had established Zoroastrianism as the
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> religion of Persia, but there were in the empire colonies of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
following other religions. Iran had <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> ceased to be a religious unit, and the
vast <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Jews, Christians, and others of divergent faiths and creeds
contributed towards disunion. Referring to the presence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
professing different religions in his kingdom, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Hormizd IV once
remarked that his throne rested on four feet;11 and troublesome these outside
elements certainly proved to the sovereign occupying the throne. A fairly
tolerable latitude was conceded to these adherepts of the alien faiths, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
occasional persecutions of them were not unknown. These non-Zoroastrians
frequently occasioned heated polemics in which virulant criticism and

derisive terms were exchanged between the the Zoroastrian priests on the
one side and the prelates of the rival faiths on the other. Iranian <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> was
often convulsed with the storm of controversy. The alien faiths were branded
as the promptings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> Spirit, and were declared to be teaching a vile

struggled in this manner with the national <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> during the Sasanian period
were Judaism and Christianity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> position in Persia we shall now discuss.

12. SLS. 6. 7. Judaism in Persia. Judea had come under the Persian rule at
the very early period. The Babylonian exile <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the Jews into close
touch with the Persians in the sixth century B.C. We have already referred to
the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the restoration of tbe temple at <span class="t2 t6 t26 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> was executed at the
royal command of the Persian kings Cyrus and Darius. The Jews had settled
in Persia in large numbers from very early times, and had planted their
colonies all over the country. They thrived peacefully and were given
privileges to manage their own civic affairs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> molestation from the
state. Some of the members of the royal <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> had even married Jewish
princesses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Yazdagard I, for example, had a Jewish consort.13 But in
general those who contracted matrimonial alliances with Jewish women were
disliked, and the Denkard inveighs in strong terms against the practice of
contracting such unions.14 In the course of time, the Persians and the
Israelites seem to have been sharply divided in religious matters.
Disputations on questions of belief must have been frequent. All of the
Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> denounce Judaism in unsparing terms. The writer of the
Denkard, for instance, avers that Judaism is not a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> religion,15 and points
to Zohak, the most detested of men, as the originator of the Jewish
scriptures,16 branding elsewhere the Jewish books as utterances of the
demons.17 Seno, a Zoroastrian sage, is reported to have said, in his

have prevailed between Zoroastrians and Jews. A later writer, confounding
Kai Lohrasp with Nebuchadnezzar, states that one of the meritorious deeds

in Iran. Christianity had entered Persia during the Parthian period, and the
Sasanians found the creed of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> more or less current when they
established their empire. Of all the alien faiths in Persia, Christianity was the
most aggressive. The pertinacious attempt of the Christians to win over
converts to their <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> from the ruling nation, often caused shedding of
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> blood. There was a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of perennial war between Sasanian Persia
and Byzantine Rome, which had embraced Christianity. The sympathy of
the Christian population naturally <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to their Roman co-religionists and
caused disturbances in Persia. Moreover, the fanatic zeal of the priests on
both sides fomented communal strife, which often resulted in the destruction
of the Zoroastrian fire-temples and Christian churches, and the consequent
persecution of the Christians. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> as are the resemblances between the

glaring distinction. Christianity exalted monastic virtues, and glorified
celibacy. The Zoroastrian priests vehemently denounced the foreign priests
who preached a mode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> which clashed with their ethics.26 Reckless
utterances of the Christian priests often aggravated the ill-feeling between
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> peoples, and violent scenes ensued. An enthusiastic bishop once
regaled his congregation by saying that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> would, in his
future life, be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in hell-fire with Satan, whereas the Christians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
translated to heaven,27 while another patriarch urged the Roman bishops to
<span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> them from the accursed rule of the [329] Persians.28 The priests on both
the sides became zealots, and occasionally fell into the slough of fanaticism.

seceders from Zoroastrianism were persecuted; apostasy was made a capital
crime by the Zoroastrian Church, and the renegades were put to death.
Notwithstanding such harsh measures adopted by the Iranian clergy,
numerous converts were made throughout the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Sasanian
rule from Zoroastrianism to Christianity. Some of the greatest saints were
won from the Zoroastrian community. A noted Zoroastrian preceptor
embraced Christianity, and later became the Patriarch under the name Mar
Aba the Great. The Zoroastrian priesthood clamoured for his death, and the

SECTS
Zoroastrianism split up into a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of sects. As indicated above, the
Zoroastrian church had lost all control over its adherents. Sect after sect
arose, each claiming to interpret the religion of Zoroaster in its own light.1
The <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that numerous sects flourished in Iran at this period is proved by the
frequent allusions to them by Greek, Arabian, Syriac, and Armenian writers.
Shahrastani, as we shall see later, speaks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sects, namely the
Zarvanites, the Gayomarthians, and the Zardushtians. Mohsan Fani refers to
fourteen sects as he witnessed in his <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> in the seventeenth century. Several
of these, he adds, flourished from early times. Unfortunately the accounts of
those sects, which we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the extant Zoroastrian literature, is very
meagre. Several of them, about which we get some information from the

non-Zoroastrian sources, are not even mentioned by name in the Iranian
works. The Armenian writers, Eznik and Elisaeus, writing in the fifth century
about the Zoroastrians of their own time, <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> they were split into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival

Eudemus states that sects flourished in Iran which held space as the
primordial being that created the rival spirits of goodness and evil.2 The most

during the Sasanian period and which had a considerable following <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>

Zarvanites. Zarvan, or Time, accompanied Mithra in his migration to the far

sovereign <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and was named after it. The sect, he says, holds Zrovan as the
generative principle of everything, and it was from this primordial principle
that both Ormizd and Arhmn have sprung. They are its twin children.16 The
Armenian historians credit Mihr Narsih, the premier of Yazdagard TI, with
speaking of Zarvan as the prime originator of Ohrmazd and Ahriman.17 According to the teachings of this sect, as portrayed by these writers Zarvan
existed when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was not, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> was not, and brooded over
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of begetting a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> create the universe. A doubt
crossed his mind, the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> claims, at the end of a <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years, lest his
<span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> should turn out fruitless and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> with a child.
The sacrifice, however, turned out fruitful, but not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> mishap. Zarvan
conceived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> offspring, one as the result of his sacrifice, the other as the
outcome of the doubt that had desecrated his mind. He resolved to give
sovereignty to him who was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> first. Ohrmazd, who seems to have been
possessed of fore-knowledge even before he was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> born, read the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>

thereupon perforated the womb and came into existence before Ohrmazd.
He demanded sovereignty from his begetter, Zarvan, who disowned this
ugly, dark creature, and gave the sceptre into the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of Ohrmazd, who
was resplendent with light. Ahriman now charged his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> with breaking

covenant with Ahriman, and decreed that the empire of the universe should
be conjointly ceded to both Ohrmazd and Ahriman for nine <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the right of priority was ever to be with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> Spirit. After the
expiration of this period, Ohrmazd, it was destined, should be at liberty to
deal with his wicked brother as he liked.18

who evidently aimed at resolving the Zoroastrian dualism into monotheism
by the apotheosis of Time, did. flourish for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in Iran.

FATALISTS
Superstitious belief in Fate that weaves the web of events in man's life.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has willed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to be the architect of his destiny and endowed him with
the freedom of will, says Zarathushtra.19 Man's ignorance and superstition
have led him to the belief that he is not a <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> agent who can control and
shape the actions of his life. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Human</span> happenings, it is believed, are regulated
by the position and movements of the stars and planets and constellations.
Ingenious brains have laboured to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> the future from the careful
observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies. They have practised
augury by watching the flight of birds and have drawn omens from the stars
and other sources. They have endeavoured to read the course of the stars and
to study with utmost scrupulous care and anxiety, worthy of more rational
and useful pursuits, the phenomena, in the vain hope that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
thereby be able to foretell coming events and forestall coming misfortunes.
Fate, they have taught,, dogs man's footsteps and overtakes him unawares. It
hunts. him like wild animals to and fro. Nothing could be done against it. In
vain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> struggle to save himself from being drowned in the floods
of fate. The mightiest among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> has to yield submission to the decrees of
unrelenting fate. This credulous belief in the inevitability of the decrees of
Fate has led <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women to accept with fatalistic resignation what befell
their lot. It has led them to submit and succumb to the buffetings of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
where they should have braved them and fought [334] them and
overpowered them. The belief in Fate and Kismet and Karma have all been
equally paralysing. In one <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> it is the movements of the stars, in other the
arbitrary will of Providence and in the third, actions of past life, that grip the
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> at every step he takes in his life. Anything and everything that
happens is predestined either by the stars and planets or by the inscrutable

decree of Kismet or by the inexorable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Karma. The fatalistic belief has
crippled the activities, cramped the progress, stifled the spirit, and blighted
the ardour of countless millions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the East. 19. See Jackson. The
Zoroastrian Doctrine of the Freedom of the Will in Zoroastrian Studies, 219-244.
Mithraism is loaded with fatalistic ideas which it received from Babylonia
before going to Europe. Orthodox Zoroastrianism did not entirely escape
the Babylonian influence. The Babylonian and Magian diviners played
important part in the lives of the people. Shah Namah abounds in instances
of superstitious regard for omens and portents and astrological auguries. The
court astrologers read the stars to indicate the future events. The kings did
not embark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> war <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> consulting the diviners.

Pahlavi Aiyadgar-i Zariran, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Vishtasp asks his <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> diviner, Jamasp, to

the national catastrophe, drove the Iranians to believe in Fate, the inevitable
necessity before which they had to bow. The fatalist doctrine pervades the

writings of the Pahlavi period. As early as the fifth century the Armenian
controversialist Eznik attacks this fatalistic doctrine of the Persians.34 Fate,
we are told, is <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> on man's forehead; he is fettered to it from his very
birth.35 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is ignorant of the course mapped out for him by Fate, which

Fate.38 34. Eznik, Against the Sects, German tr. Schmid,2. 15, Vienna, 1900.

Despite such prominence given to the workings of Fate by the Pahlavi
writers, fatalism never came to be employed among the Zoroastrians as an
excuse for cloaking man's indolence. It is idle persons, we are told, that
blame Fate.48 The feeble and faltering always throw the burden of their faults
on Fate. The ever active <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of Zoroastrianism militated against fatalism,

HERESIES
Heretics detested more than the demon-worshippers. Heresy was one of
the greatest crimes of which a Zoroastrian could be guilty according to the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> texts. It was a criminal! offense punishable by law. The severity of
the law, however, was considerably modified during the Sasanian period,
even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> during this period do not show any
considerable advance in real religious toleration. In his letter to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of
Tabaristan, Tansar states that, in the statutes which Ardashir had framed, he
had greatly modified the rigour of the law; for, whereas formerly a heretic
was instantly killed, Tansar's royal <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> had ordered that such a sinner
should be imprisoned for one year, and that the religion of Ohrmazd should
be preached to him daily during that period in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to reclaim him from
heresy. If he still persisted obstinately in his heretical belief, capital
punishment was to be inflicted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him as a last resort.1 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Noshirvan
extirpated heresies when he came to the throne.2 Any one also who did not
give assent to the dogmatic teachings of the Zoroastrian creed, or
expounded views that were at variance with those sanctioned by her
authority, incurred the odium of heresy, and came under the ban of
ecclesiastical excommunication. The Church forbade with proscription any
criticism of its authoritative canon; the ecclesiastical doctrine was fixed, and
to think otherwise was heresy. Giving the definition of a heretic, the
Denkard states that whosoever teaches, speaks, or acts respecting the beliefs
and practices of the national <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> differently from that which the ancients
have done is a heretic.3 Heretics are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> kinds: the deceiver, deceived,
and the opinionated.4 All of these misrepresent the teachings of the elders,
and pervert [339] the sacred writings,5 as they declaim against the
established teachings.6 They promote, in opposition to Ohrmazd, the
wicked religion of Ahriman.7 The, heretic is possessed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> Spirit.8 He
is the disciple of the demon of heresy.9 The demons lodge in his body;10 he
is, in fact, a demon in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> form.11 Even during his lifetime, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
resembles a corpse and the faithful should refrain from coming in contact
with him, lest they themselves become defiled.12 Bad as is his lot in this
world, it is worse in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to come. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is doomed to everlasting
torture. It becomes a darting snake, and there is no resurrection for it.13 For
these reasons, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are warned to guard themselves from anything that
savours of heresy.14 The Pahlavi writers, in every treatise, are unsparing in

their denunciation of heretics, arraigning them for deception, lying, and
perversion. The heretic Gurgi is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a disreputable impostor, <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of
avarice, and worthy of every opprobrium.15 In a similar manner, the Pahlavi

the reign of Ardavan, the last of the Parthian kings.16 He received his first
revelation at the age of thirteen, and ultimately claimed to be a prophet, the
very seal or the last messenger of God.17 He began his propaganda under
Ardashir, but worked with greater vigour under Shapur I, who embraced his
faith.18 Manichaeism flourished with varied success [340] side by side with
the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> religion until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Bahram I ascended the throne. The
teachings of Mani acquired a strong hold over the minds of many, and
threatened to be a powerful rival of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> faith. The national <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
rebelled against the encroachment of the new cult, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> strove to
extinguish the heresy by the exercise of a firm hand. He confronted Mani
with his Dastur, who threw him a challenge that, both of them should pour
molten lead on their bellies, and whosoever came out unhurt should be
declared to be in the right. This Mani did not accept. Consequently in A.D.
276-277 he was flayed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was stuffed with straw.19 With
the removal of Mani from the field of activity, the Manichaean propaganda
entered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its dissolution in Iran, but the seed of the new <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> he had
sown did -not remain unfruitful. Despite the heavy slaughter of the
Manichaeans, the new cult spread from the home of its origin to the Far East,
reaching even as far as China, and penetrated far into the West in the fourth
century, where for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it contested supremacy with Christianity,
somewhat as Persian Mithraism had done before it. St. Augustine was a
follower of Manichaeism before he was converted to Christianity. He was
not able to <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> himself from the influence of his teachings even after he had
joined the Christian Church. He imparted its dualistic philosophy to Christian doctrine.20

religion and based his new religion on materials drawn from [341]
Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Syrian Gnosticism. In his
synthetic religion he accepts the dualistic theory as the basic doctrine to
explain the existence of evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> which is synonymous with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> existed

its cardinal principles from Zoroastrianism. The author of Shikand Gumanik
Vijar devotes a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> (16th) to the teachings of Mani and refutes them.
The subject, however, remains incomplete as the latter part of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
lost. Some of the more prominent features of Manichaeism, which are
fundamentally foreign to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of Zoroastrianism, are the ascetic
principles of self-mortification, celibacy, fasting, and the vow of poverty.
Each of these in turn we shall examine from the point of <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of

Zoroastrianism, and seek at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to determine the basic difference
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> theories of life.
Mani holds matter to be the root of evil, hence self-mortification of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is a virtue in his system. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as composed of matter, according
to this thinker, is inherently evil. On this very ground he denies the final
resurrection.25 Manichaeism brands all bodily desires as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and legislates for
their stifling and killing. Since all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> has its root in the body, salvation is
possible only through the extirpation of bodily desires. Mani's system of
religion becomes quietistic, ascetic, and inculcates only passive virtues. He
taught his followers to abhor all natural pleasures and abandon them. He
strove to extinguish the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the bodily desires. The devout was to begin
by abstaining from every comfort and from every amusement. In spite of this,
temptations assail him on all sides, so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he lives in the midst of earthly
attachments. To adopt a practical image, the centipede does not lose much if
one of its legs is broken, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is not safe when he succeeds in eradicating
one desire, for another takes its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and haunts him in the quiet moments,
even when the ardent longing of communing with the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> consumes him.
He is still overcome by passion, by the [342] <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> of wife and child, of
hearth and home. He feels that he cannot liberate himself from the
unbearable yoke of these strong passions, unless he flees from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to
some solitary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where joys and sorrows cannot reach him. Life, such a
one thinks, is a fleeting illusion. It cannot give him enduring calm.
Accordingly, he breaks his family ties, shuns society, becomes a hermit, and
lives a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of complete quiescence. He courts negation.
25. Sg. 16.50. Zoroastrianism stands for controlling and regulating bodily
desires, but not for supprtssing and killing them. The antithesis of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
and soul, <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> and spirit, is not unknown to the Pahlavi writers. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
in itself is not evil. According to Zoroastrianism, matter is not inherently
evil, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> is not necessarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> in the spirit.

the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the clergy and of other righteous persons who aimed at <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>

life, it was obligatory that they should be celibates. Zoroastrianism legislates
for the clergy and the laity alike. In Mani's system marriage was a vice for
the priest, a reluctant concession to the layman. According to the religion of
Zoroaster, it is neither the one nor the other; it is a positive virtue for both.
Sacerdotal piety does not tend to celibacy in Iran. It is disapproved for all
and under all circumstances. In no stage of the individual's moral and
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> development is marriage ever considered as incompatible with
saintliness.

austerities, but only by prayers and work. Far from recommending these
ascetic practices as virtues, he prohibits them as sins. Fasting formed no part

reprobated in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of all periods. Fasting is a sin, and the only fast that
the faithful are exhorted to keep is the fast from sin.47 The wilful abstinence
from <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> is a deliberate [346] disregard of the bounty of Ohrmazd. In his
exaggerated <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the need of fasting, the ascetic weakens his body, and

accumulate property. The <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> originates with the improper <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of one's
possessions, and the faithful are expressly warned not to lust for and indulge
exclusively in the accumulation of the material wealth at the expense of the
spiritual.49 This reprimand serves as a corrective to the unbridled <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
covet earthly riches.50 Wealth of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is undoubtedly superior to that of

said to have been rendered into Arabic by Ibnul Muqaffa. The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has been
lost, but its contents have been preserved in other Arabic works.69 The
author of Dabistan says that he met some Mazdakites who practised their
religion secretly among the Mohammedans. These showed him a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span>

accursed heterodox who observes fasts,71 who appeared to cause disturbance
among the faithful.72 He was contemporary with Kobad.73 Mazdak agreed
with the fundamental doctrine of Zoroastrianism in respect to the indelible
antithesis between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principles, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> and Darkness, or Ohrmazd and
[349] Ahriman.74 Masudi calls him a Zendik.75 Tabari, Mirkhond, and others
accuse him of teaching the doctrine of the community of wives.76 The
Dabistan repeats the statement.77 Mazdak's revolutionary reform, however,
was not so much religious as it was social and economic, for he preached
communism, pure and simple. 68. Modi, Mazdak the Iranian Socialist in Dastur

The <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Mazdak's system is very meagre; but it is known that he
accounted Jealousy, Wrath, and Greed as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> main causes of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in
the world. Everyone, according to Mazdak's teachings, should be given
equal opportunity and equal share of the enjoyment of the earthly
possessions of God. So it was originally ordained by God, but that natural

finally embraced it. His son, Prince Noshirvan, summoned the Dasturs and
Mobads to consider the situation. It was certain that the cult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> spread
and the young prince adopted severe measures to suppress it, lest it should
menace the public peace. The clergy who viewed the new heresy with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

OHRMAZD

The supreme godhead. Ohrmazd is the Pahlavi equivalent of the Avestan
Ahura Mazda in the Pahlavi writings of the Sasanian period and later. The
concept of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Being retains its former abstract and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
character in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the Pahlavi writers. Ohrmazd is what the entire
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> is not, and he is not what anything in the universe is. The author of
the Denkard describes him by negatives, and states that Ohrmazd is the
sovereign, and not slave; father, and not child; first, and, not last; master, and
not servant; lord, and not serf; protector, and not protected; changeless, and
not changeable; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> itself, and not acquiring knowledge; giver and
not receiver.1 Radiant and glorious are his standing epithets in the Pazend
prayers. We shall presently discuss some of the most prominent of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
attributes which the Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> ascribe to Ohrmazd.
1. Vol. 3, p. 176,177.
Ohrmazd is eternal. Ohrmazd had no beginning and has no end. He alone
is the one who is neither <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> nor dies.2 His adversary is inferior to him in
this respect, that there will be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when he will not exist. Ohrmazd ever
was, is, and will ever be.3 He is the causer of causes, himself being causeless.4
He is the prime source of existence.5

Ohrmazd is invisible. The concept of the spirituality of Ohrmazd remains
unchanged. He is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of Spirits.6 Invisibility is the chief characteristic
of spirituality, and Ohrmazd is said to be invisible.7 He is so even to the
other <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> beings.8 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> present in everything, he is unseen
anywhere.9 When [351] Viraf is escorted by Srosh and Atar to the celestial
court, and presented by Vohuman to Ohrmazd he hears the voice of

Ohrmazd, sees a light, but does not see him <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> to face.10 The souls of the
righteous ones <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t11 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t26 hoverable">behold</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Ohrmazd in heaven, and console
themselves as having seen Ohrmazd himself.11

He is intangible. The Gathic and Later Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> spoke figuratively of
the hands, mouth, eyes, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Ohrmazd. In the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
Zaratusht is portrayed as sitting by the side of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and saying to him
that the head, hands, feet, hair, mouth, tongue, and even clothes of
Ohrmazd resembled his own and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he wished to grasp the Heavenly

for, as the godhead, he is intangible.12 A later text, on the contrary, speaks of
Ohrmazd as taking hold of the prophet's <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and giving him <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> in the
shape of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to swallow.13

knows all that is to come, and is aware of the final overthrow and end of his
adversary.16 Through his <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> it is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can guide himself to the path

their names is good, the sight of them is better, but to carry out their

Zaratusht.41 He enters into the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of the infant,42 and makes the child
laugh immediately at birth.43 When Ahriman lets loose the fiends to destroy
the babe, Ohrmazd sends Vohuman to save it.44 The archangel hastens to
the home of Zaratusht and dispels Akoman, whom he finds there.45 When
the child prophet, according to the legend, was put in the den of wolves by
the wizards, Vohuman, with the help of Srosh, <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a sheep <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of milk at

IZADS
The angels. Izad is the Pahlavi equivalent of the Avestan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Yazata, and is
similarly employed as the designation for an angel. These angels are
immortal and invisible;1 and some of them, who were pre-eminently the
genii of the living in the Younger Avestan period, have by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> been
transferred more particularly to the sphere of the dead. For example, Srosh,
Rashn and Mihr, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the most prominent Izads of the Avestan period,
have changed their sphere of activity. In the Avestan period they were the
genii exclusively of the corporeal world, but now they are converted into the
judges of the dead. In the Pahlavi time, the faithful, rather than looking to
them for protection and help in this world, solicit more especially their
favour for the next world. Srosh still retains some of his earthly functions,
but he becomes the genius of the dead first, and of the living afterwards. The
angels Hom and Din have extended their sphere of activity by joining
Tishtar in his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of producing rain.2 Certain qualities that were attributed
in the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> to one angel are now loosely ascribed to another.

The Izads are the loving guides and protectors of men. They first
expounded the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Ohrmazd to Gayomard, the primeval man;3 and they
are ever ready to fulfil the behests of Ohrmazd, who has created them for
the welfare of his creatures.4 They most frequently visit the sacred temples
consecrated to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> Bahram.5 They help man,6 and instruct him in
goodness.7 It is through their aid that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> learns to know God, to dispel
demons, and to liberate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from the future torments of [369] hell.8
Man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of them enables him to enter into relationship with his
creator;9 for he is unable to progress morally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> their assistance.10 If

Through their wisdom, moreover, he becomes illustrious,12 and attains to
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> wealth through them.13 They hasten to help the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who practises

by invoking them.15 It was for this very <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that the prophet Zaratusht
prayed to them to grant him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> leadership.16 They keep

the Worlds.17 As a physician removes bodily illness, or as a farmer cleans
corn of all impurity, so do the angels remove harm from man.18 They keep
up this relation with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he practises goodness, but they give up

foresee, through their superior <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to be of eventual harm to him.24

Sacrificial offerings made to the angels. We have already seen that meat
formed a conspicuous article among the sacrificial gifts made to the heavenly
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the Avestan period. [370] Meat viands are the special feature of the

sacred feast during the Pahlavi period. The Pahlavi treatise Shayast-laShayast explains what particular parts of a slaughtered animal are to be
specifically dedicated to the various divinities in ceremonies. The angel
Hom's right to receive the tongue, jaw, and <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> eye, recognized by the
Avestan scriptures, remains still undisputed.27 The <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and neck, shoulders
and thighs, loin and belly, kidneys and lungs, liver and spleen, legs and tail,
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and entrails are all distributed among several different beings; until at
last the tail-bone falls to the lot of the august Farohar of Zaratusht, and the

Decomposed meat is not to be consecrated to any angel;29 nor is any meat at
all to be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in any ceremony for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of a

He retains his position as the genius of rain. The Pahlavi writers reproduce
the <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Tishtar's fight with Aposh from the Avestan Yasht 8, which
celebrates his work.69 The Yasht spoke of the help that Ohrmazd gave
Tishtar when he was routed in his first combat with his adversary and
invoked the Supreme Being for help and strength. The Dadistan adds that
besides Ohrmazd the archangels and the guardian spirits also carried help to
him.70 Vohuman, Ardvisur, Vat, Hom, and Din are spoken of as his
associates.71 Tishtar seizes rain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> from the ocean,72 carries seeds of plants

but if they are not properly propitiated, they wander disconsolate about their
former abodes for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and finally depart leaving their curse. Such a curse
is irrevocable, if once given, unless nullified by the Farohars who uttered it.

The line of distinction between the souls and the Farohars of the dead is
gradually obliterated in the Pahlavi texts. By the end of the Pahlavi period
both of these <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> faculties, namely, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the Farohar, are
invoked to come down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. The Pahlavi texts, accordingly, <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of
the souls or of the Farohars, as the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> may be, as coming to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> on

hand, always spoke of the advent of the Farohars (not of the souls) to this

PRAYERS AND RITUALS
Pazend prayers. When the Sasanians came to power, the Avesta, the sacred
language of Zoroastrianism, has ceased to be a living tongue. The daily
prayers continued to be recited in the dead language. The need was
evidently felt to supplement the Avestan prayers by some additional prayers
in the vernacular. Dastur Adarbad Mahraspand, the learned high-priest and
premier of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Shapur II, composed such supplementary prayers in Pazend,
and his example was followed by other Dasturs. Several benedictory,
thanksgiving, and expiatory prayers composed during this period have come
down to us and are recited as supplementary prayers to the Avestan prayers
to the present day. The composers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the original Avestan prayers as the
source of their inspiration. Short Avestan formulas or sentences are often
rendered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> in Pazend. The Pazend version of the Avestan
confessional prayer frastuye,1 for example, forms the opening part of the Patit.
Besides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reproducing the Avestan passages in Pazend, independent

praise of Ohrmazd, Amshaspands, and Izads, presiding over the thirty <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
of the month. The original Avestan wedding hymn has not come down to us.
What has reached us is a Pazend hymn, composed during the Sasanian
period, embodying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Avestan passages.2 The important Pazend prayers

that are extant consist of the Afrins, Sitayishes, Patits, Nirangs, the
introductory and closing parts of the Avestan Nyaishes and Yashts, and
several devotional pieces of considerable beauty.

Supplicatory prayers. The worshipper extols Ohrmazd as the eternal,
omnipotent, and beneficent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and asks him to exalt his thoughts and lead
him to goodness and happiness in accordance with his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will. The
devotee sees none besides [380] Ohrmazd, he is his only hope. He,
therefore, beseeches him to protect and help him.3 His is greatness and his is
glory, he who is the creator, protector, and liberator of all. The faithful
implore him to give holiness and happiness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> all and bestow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them

ask him to liberate them from the tyranny of the wicked, to help the
helpless, to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> comfort to those that are in trouble. He alone, they
acknowledge, is the source of protection and help to all and is the one who
redresses the wrongs of all.4 The angel presiding over the moon is asked to
give ease and health, and the fulfillment of right wishes, joy, well-being, and
fearlessness.5 The faithful pray that they may be exalted in both the worlds,
and may have health and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> life, name and fame, wealth and happiness.
Their fervent prayer is that no harm and distress should come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them

of commission and omission, which have been recognized as sins by
Ohrmazd and which have been accepted as such by those of the early <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span>
and say that they repent in the presence of Ohrmazd and the Amshaspands

penitence.15 The penitent prays that whatever was the will of Ohrmazd
according to which he should have thought, but had not thought: according
to which he should have spoken, but had not spoken: and according to
which he should have done, but had not done-of all these sins he repents.
He further repents of the thoughts, words, and deeds which were after the
will of Ahriman and which he should have abstained from and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he had

The Nirangs. The Avestan mânthra, Pahlavi mânsar, 'spell,' has nirang, for its
Pazend equivalent. Several such formulas, often embodying Avestan
passages, are composed in Pazend, to be recited to obtain various results.

They are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to deprecate evil, to rout the malignant demons of disease, to

Independent origin of evil. The sharp antithesis of the Avestan period
between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is still further intensified by the Pahlavi writers. In
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> dualism reaches its consummation in this period. It is the standard
philosophy, and is upheld as the only possible solution of the problem of
evil. The author of the Shikand Gumanik Vijar, who is himself a dualist of
the most pronounced kind, strongly urges in his polemics against other
religions that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> can on no <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> have originated from one and

existence as good; they are both primeval. They are so entirely separate from
each other that neither <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> originates from evil, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> from good.1 Each
one of them exists by itself, and entertains perpetual antagonism towards the
other.2 The pairs of opposites such as heat and cold, perfume and stench,
pleasure and pain, health and sickness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death, and all others fall

It seems
that the dualistic system is criticized by the non-Zoroastrian critics as
detracting from the grandeur of the [385] godhead;7 but the author of this
treatise retorts by arguing at length that the indispensable attributes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
such as his goodness, omniscience, omnipotence, and the rest, demand that
he could not simultaneously be the producer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and of evil.

also his creation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is either not wholly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or he is not wholly

The
controversialist continues by addressing arguments to prove that Ohrmazd
cannot be held accountable for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> impairing some one or more of
his attributes that are essential to his divinity; and whatever reflects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

the main arguments advanced by the learned controversialist against the
theory of tracing both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> to one and the Same source.

The goodness of Ohrmazd demands that he could on no <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> be the
author of evil. One of the essential requisites of the godhead is goodness. If
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> arises from him as the deity, he is imperfect in goodness, and
consequently could not be deserving of praise and <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> from men.8 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span>

If the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> being

in goodness; and a being that is imperfect in goodness is not to be glorified
by men.9 If he is perfect in goodness, he could not wish for the presence of
evil, but only for its extinction;10 for a being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> will is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is unworthy of
his divinity.11 Such a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> destroys his attribute of goodness. But Ohrmazd is
perfect in goodness;12 and consequently, his will being eternally good, only
goodness should prevail in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> from its beginning up to its end.13 But,
the author maintains, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> shows more of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> than goodness,14 hence

From the trend of his argument we might be led to think that our author <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

independent in his origin, will ultimately bow the knee before Ohrmazd and

Unmerited harm could not emanate from a just God. Ohrmazd is just, and
administers justice with exactitude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> all. Now, if he is the author of evil,
crime, and sin, there is no justice in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> creating these and then

justice, moreover, to inflict unlimited punishment for a limited sin, and to
cause perpetual pain and distress to his creatures for indulging in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

whereas the existence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is a glaring injustice to innocent humanity.

before man, he says, it must either have been created by God, or it had its

Ahriman is a spirit. As the very name of the arch-fiend indicates, he is a
spirit, and as such can be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of in the mind, but cannot be seen by the

The end of Ahriman. One of the essential proofs of Ahriman's inequality
with Ohrmazd is that he is not eternal. As has been noted above, although
he was co-eval and co-equal with Ohrmazd, he is not co-eternal, because
there will be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when he will cease to exist.142 Ohrmazd and Ahriman are

wickedness, Ahriman will be baffled in his vile attempts to tempt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to the
wicked path.143 Ahriman will then <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his resources exhausted and will
become impotent and confounded.144 Being completely overpowered,145 and
broken,146 predominating no longer,147 he will become afflicted and
miserable.148 He will bow his unwilling knees to the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> authority. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
baffled, [397] he will flee into darkness and be fettered in hell in perpetual

The emissaries of Ahriman. There are six arch-fiends created by Ahriman in
exact opposition to the archangels; and there are also other minor demons as

Hell is the specific
habitat assigned to them, and from there they rush to the summit of Mount
Arezur to hold their infernal council.160 The north is believed to be the
region of Ahriman and demons, just as the south is that of Ohrmazd and
angels; and darkness is the steadfast quality of this fiendish crew.161

DRUJ

The change wrought in the conception of her work. This personification of
wickedness and deceit has by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> lost her distinctive individuality, and
consequently she no longer remains an exclusive rival of Artavahisht, or Best
Righteousness. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> her name is not mentioned as Ahriman's countercreation against Artavahisht. Indar, as we shall see in the sequel, usurps her

period stands exclusively as the class designation of the female demons,
which in earlier times was her chief characteristic. The term is at times

the opponent of ArtaVahisht.211 In Ys. 48.1, Druj is glossed in Pahlavi by
Indar. His personality is again quite ill-defined. He does not personify
Wickedness proper, as the opponent of Artavahisht should logically do in
the dualistic system; but his chief business is to drive the thoughts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

righteous, but is dragged to hell by means of this rope if it is wicked.231
When the wicked demon Astovidad strokes a man, he causes lethargy; when

of hell, ready to drag the wicked souls down to the infernal depths, as soon
as they are sentenced to hell by the heavenly judges. When the souls
approach the bridge, he contends with Srosh for their possession.237 He casts
a noose around the neck of all persons. The righteous ones are able to <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span>

the arch-enemy of Zoroastrianism, to invade the territories of Gushtasp, who
had embraced Zoroaster's faith,248 but Arjasp's ruin followed. Terrible as was

away in terror when he was first assaulted by this demon of drought, but how

at last overpowered [405] powered his adversary.255 This demon struggles

Jeh
A powerful demoness. Ahriman has created the menses in women; and Jeh is
the demoness of menstruation. She is so powerful that her very look smites

Other Demons
The author of the Bundahishn tells us that every single demon is
accompanied by many more, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be tedious to enumerate them all

mentioned in the texts, but about whom nothing special is known. They are
Mitokht and Arast (falsehood), Arashk (malice), Bushasp (sloth), Uda
(chattering while eating), Zarman (decrepitude), Akatash (perversion),
Oshtohad (excessive winter), [406]Chishmak (disaster), Varun (lust), Sej

The bridge provides a wide <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> to the pious souls, but confronts the
wicked with its sharp edge. The bridge is guarded by the angels and the
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> dogs.44 It is broad as a beam and has many sides. Some of these are
twenty-seven reeds in width or nine spears or nine javelins or even a league
in width, whereas the others are as sharp as the edge of a razor.45 The bridge
is so arranged that it presents its broad side when a righteous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> passes over
it, and gives it an easy passage, but puts forward its thin edge when a wicked
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> attempts to cross it.46 According to Mohammedanism all souls have to
cross the Bridge as-Sirat which lies across <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and hell. It is finer than a
hair and sharper than the edge of a sword. It gives an easy <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> to the
righteous souls, but the souls of the wicked cannot cross it and fall headlong
into hell. The pious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is helped by Srosh, Atar, and by its own conscience
to cross the bridge and go to its destination, but the impious one falls
headlong into hell.47 A <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> adds that, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> Frabag smites the darkness

Furthermore, Vae, the angel of wind,, takes such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> by its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and

not affect the sinner only, but generally abides in a lineage.50 The wicked
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> complains that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prefer being cut by a sharp knife or pierced by

All conceivable forms of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> torture prevail in hell. Viraf recounts the
ghastly spectacle he had witnessed in the vision vouchsafed him of hell. The
various kinds of most hideous tortures in hell are so dreadful that the
torments and sufferings in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> dwindle into insignificance before
them; and the worst of earthly calamities and inflictions present but a feeble
and inadequate counterpart of their terror.129 Nay the memory [421] of the
miseries on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the only joy for the unfortunate inmates of hell in
contrast to the torment they have to undergo in the inferno. Viraf relates
that the souls are ever gnawed by snakes and scorpions, worms and other
noxious creatures, flogged with darting serpents as whips in the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of
demons, suspended <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> downwards by one leg or by the breasts in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of women or, again, trodden under the feet of cattle. Iron spikes and wooden
pegs are driven into their eyes; they are made to stand on hot brass and
compelled to lick a hot oven with their tongues. A brazen caldron is
constantly boiling, and is continually fed by the tens of thousands of
wretched souls flung into it. Miserable as their lot is as they are cooked, it is

made still more miserable by the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> that burns them never
consumes them. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> such miserable wretches could have hope that a

even that one solace is denied to the damned, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> burns them
unceasingly, their souls are equally eternal, and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be

Solitude in hell is appalling. One of the miseries that the souls have to
endure in hell is its solitude.130 The souls stand as close to one another as the
ear is to the eye, but each one feels itself alone and solitary; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the
souls be as many in <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> as hairs in the mane of a horse, each one feels
that it is lost in solitude, with no <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> to see its sufferings and no ears to hear
its groanings.131 A <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> souls are huddled <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in the short space of

and considers itself thrown out in the wilderness.132

Intensity of the darkness and stench of hell. The infernal region is the

conceived of as being so dense that it can be grasped by hand,134 and the
stench such that it can be cut with a knife.135 All the wood in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> put

the earth, the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the moon, and the stars, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and water, clouds and

DOWNFALL OF THE SASANIANS, AND THE AFTERMATH
Iran sinks before the hordes of Arabs. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Khusru Parviz, who had
waged the last war in the standing rivalry with the West, heralded the
collapse of the Persian empire. The death-knell of the national greatness had
been struck when with the advent of the weak kings on the throne the
commanders, who felt the allegiance of the army to them rather than to the
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> of the king, persuaded the army to revolt. Rival princes strove to
assert their respective rights to the throne. Court intrigues and strifes became
rife. The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> wars with the Romans in the far West and the Eastern hordes

near at home, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> inroads were facilitated by the unfavourable
geographical position of Persia, had exhausted the national resources. Famine
and plague had extended their ravages over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> country. Unbridled
luxury, with all its concomitant vices, was imported from foreign lands, and
the simplicity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> inculcated by Zarathushtra and zealously upheld by the
Dasturs was abandoned. The masses did not escape the contagion of the
luxury and vice of the nobility, and the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of simplicity was replaced by a
feverish <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of pleasure. The simple habits fostered by agricultural
pursuits were on the wane; and the entire social fabric of Iran was seriously
dislocated. The springs of patriotism were sapped, and the bravery with
which the Persians of old had faced their national foes was weakened. The
age of valour had given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to an age of weakness and decay. These causes
aggravated the downfall of Iran and foreshadowed the coming catastrophe,
and there was none to come out as a saviour in this the darkest period of the
nation's agony, so as to avert the impending ruin. In the midst of this chaos
and confusion, Yazdagard III, the last of the illustrious <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Sasan, sat on
the tottering throne.
Since Zoroaster founded his religion, Persia played her conspicuous [438]
part as one of the mightiest empires of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
During this <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> period when mighty empires rose and fell and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> events
in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> history <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> place, the peninsula of Arabia harboured a vast
population that led its uneventful, independent life. The pastoral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
were divided into innumerable tribes always at war with one another. These
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">sons</span> of the desert were generous and hospitable, active and of rugged virtues.
They were inured to fatigue and scorching rays of the sun. They made
predatory excursions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> neighbouring peoples. Internal feuds kept them
divided.
On a sudden, the greatest and most marvellous revolution of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> history
overtook Arabia, which soon changed the history of mankind. Arabia gave a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> prophet to the world. Mohammed united the discordant, warring tribes
into one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and bound them with one common religious and political
bond. He breathed new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into the multitude and made them conscious of
their power. He leavened the masses, elevated their morals, taught them a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of worship, and instilled in them a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the dignity of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
nature. He inspired them with religious fervour and animated them with

burning enthusiasm for one mighty cause, the spread of Islam. To their
traditional warlike zeal, he added religious enthusiasm and this combination
made them irresistible. They fought with fiery zeal, reckless valour, and
fanatic fury. They broke the mightiest empires of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and changed the
destinies of mankind.
Pulsating with the vigour and zeal of youth, and frenzied by the sudden rise
of fortune, the host of these formidable foes overran Iran in the first half of
the seventh century; and the decisive battles of Qadisiya and Nihavand
sealed her fate. The Kingly <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">Glory</span> that had guarded the fortunes of the
nation had flown away, and the star of Islam had risen. The Crescent
superseded the Kava banner, Shahinshah was followed by Caliph, Ohrmazd
was replaced by Allah. Zaratusht gave <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to Mohammed, the Koran
supplanted the Avesta, and the thrilling cry of the Muazzin from the minaret
of the mosque drowned the intonations of the Mobad at the altar in the firetemple and proclaimed; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is great. There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> but God, and
Mohammed is the prophet of God.
Persecution and conversion. The Iranian nation now broke into pieces.
There was not the remotest chance of its ever [439] rising to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> again.
Confusion and chaos became rampant. The sufferings wrought on the
faithful by the conquering hordes defy description. Tens of thousands
embraced Islam, and threw in their lot with the conquerors to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> relief
from the persecution that raged around them. Many <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> over to the new
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> because it enabled them to preserve their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and influence. Others
became converts, because conversion <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to them exemption from the
payment of the poll-tax. Similar causes contributed to the conversion of the
Zoroastrians to Islam in the course of successive centuries. Many embraced
Islam under the influence of Abu Muslim during the eighth century. The
Samanid dynasty (a.d. 874-999) is named after Saman, a Zoroastrian noble of
Balkh. He claimed his descent from the famous warrior Bahram Chaubin. He
gave up his <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> for the religion of Mohammed. The Zoroastrian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the
Qabusiyya dynasty adopted Islam at the beginning of the ninth century. The
influence of Daylam <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> many Zoroastrians to Islam during the end of
the ninth century. The Zoroastrian poet named Mahyar gave up his ancestral
religion under the influence of his Mohammedan poet friend who had
instructed him in the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of poetry. Those that were more devoted to the

national <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> resolved to stick to it at any cost. In this they were imitating
their prophet who, when tempted by Ahriman to renounce the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
Mazdayasnian religion, had said that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not do so even to save his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> or his life.1 The inevitable had come, but they could not afford to
resign themselves to it. If they fostered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of resignation and despair,
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be wiped away from the surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the intense
struggle for existence. Zoroastrianism inspired them from <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> to assert
themselves, even in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of disheartening obstacles of such magnitude
and the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of coming calamities that were ever imminent. If Ahriman had
reduced them to such an abject state, it was cowardice to succumb to his
doing. It was heroic to revolt against it. 1 Vd. 19.7.
The frequent ravages caused by the inroads of the Tartar and Turk, Mongol
and Afghan hordes added to the hardships of the Iranians. Persecutions
checkered their progress. Century after century their <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> decreased by
repeated conversions to Islam. When Agha Mohammed Khan, the founder
of the Qajar [440]dynasty, laid a siege to Kerman during the end of the

Writing to their coreligionists in India in the fifteenth century, they
complain that ever since the overthrow of the empire they are living under
such troublesome times that the atrocities of a Zohak, or an Afrasiab, or an
Alexander, pale before what they have been suffering for nine centuries.2

slept smarting under the indignities inflicted on them during the day, were
haunted by the spectre of persecution in their dreams, and awoke in the
morning with gloomy thoughts of the impending morrow. At best they were
suffered to exist, they could not live humanly. This was the veritable iron age
of Zoroastrianism and its followers, spoken of in the Bahman Yasht.
Zoroastrianism had struggled for its very existence during this period in
Persia, and its followers during such troublesome times had to practise their
religious rites by stealth.

Almost every vestige of Iranian scholarship perishes. The literary edifice of
Iran had crumbled along with the empire, after the invasion of Alexander the
Great. What little the nation was able to restore during the Sasanian period
fell now once more before the devastating fury of the Arabs. Iranian culture
never truly emerged from the shock of this final blow. Many of the most
famous writers who have contributed to the Arabic literature and science
were themselves Zoroastrian converts to Islam or descendants of those who
had embraced Islam in earlier days. We look in vain in the extant Pahlavi
literature for the literary <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of merit on secular subjects by the
Zoroastrian writers. These have evidently perished. We meet with occasional
attempts on the part of the priests to save the literary tradition from
extinction. The fall of the Umayyads and the ascendency of the Abbasid
Caliphs in 749, by the help of the Persians, succeeded in supplanting the
Arab supremacy by a Persian power. The Abbasids owed their elevation to
the throne to the [441]Persians, who now rose to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and influence.
Persian method of administration, and Persian food, dress and music
prevailed at the royal court and among the people. The observance of the
Nuruz, the festival of the New Year, was introduced. Ministers of Persian
extraction came to the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of affairs. A noble Persian family, known to
history, as the Barmicide, descended from Barmak, who was the high-priest
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> fire-temple of Navbahar at Balkh, remained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> for over
fifty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> (a.d. 752-804) and wisely directed the affairs of the Caliphate.
The Zoroastrians got a favourable opportunity of peacefully conducting their
literary activities; and some of the important Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that have come
down to us were produced during this period, more particularly in the reign
of al-Mamun, (a.d. 813-833). After that era the literary activity appears to
have been arrested, for no original <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> were produced that can be assigned
to the period following. The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of copying manuscripts, however, was
carried on up to modern times, and it is owing to the zealous activity of
faithful adherents to the cause that the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> have reached us.
A glimpse into the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Iranians during the centuries that
followed. From this period onward we have very little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the

insufficiency of the data prevents us from forming any very clear opinion
about their beliefs. What little information we have of this period comes

mostly from the Mohammedan writers.
Masudi wrote about a.d. 950 that Avesta came as revelation from heaven.
Zend is commentary. Those who differed from the Avesta were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Zendiks, because they based their statements on the Zend rather than the
original Avesta. Al-Biruni, who flourished about a.d. 1000, gives some
scattered information on miscellaneous matters of religious practice, which
he gathered from the Zoroastrians of his day. We shall select some points of
interest from his description. The angel Srosh, he notes, is spoken of as the
most powerful angel against the sorcerers, and he visits the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times
during the night to rout them. It was Srosh who introduced the practice of
Zam-zama, that is, reciting one's prayers with closed lips and emitting
inarticulate sounds or in bAj, as the Zoroastrians do to this present day.
Artavahisht, as the genius of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and light, watches [442]over mankind, he
says, and heals diseases with drugs, but besides this, as the genius who
presides at the ordeal by fire, distinguishes a truth-speaking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from a liar.3
We have already seen that by the end of the Pahlavi period the sharp
distinction between man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and his Farohar was forgotten, and both were
regarded as one and the same. Commenting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the observance of the

in his own time, al-Biruni says that the Zoroastrians believed that the souls of
the dead, both righteous and wicked, descended to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> during these
ten days. They, therefore, fumigated the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> with juniper, and put dishes
of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and drink on the roofs of their houses, in the pious expectation that
the souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> inhale their savour and receive nourishment and comfort.
The pious souls, moreover, assumed invisible forms, dwelt among their
relatives, and <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> part in their affairs.4 Spandarmad, he observes, is the
guardian of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and of chaste women who are devoted to their

this day. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> get a Pahlavi incantation <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> by the priests, preferably in

fasting was regarded a sin. The injunction not to fast seems to have been
faithfully followed, for al-Biruni attests that he who observed a fast was

compelled to feed some needy persons by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of expiation for his sin.6

coreligionists on the point and asks them not to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the Zoroastrians as
fire-worshippers because they were the worshippers of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> God.

We have already seen that the religious dissensions during the Parthian and
Sasanian periods had racked the Zoroastrian [443] world. Sects and heresies
had sprung up in consequence. Several of these flourished in Iran for
centuries after the downfall of the Persian empire. Shahristani (a.d. 10861153) in his <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">Book</span> of Sects attests the existence of some of these in his times.
The more prominent of these were the Mazdakites, Zarvanites, and the
Gayomarthians. The latter sect, about which we hear for the first time,
evidently derived its name from Gayomard, the primeval man. The followers
of this sect, we are told, believe in an <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> being who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yazdan.
This first principle, it is said, existed when there was nothing beside him; he
entertained a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on the probability of the origin of an

Ever
since the manifestation of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> one, there goes on a fierce war between
the powers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and darkness.8

This appears to be still another attempt to palliate dualism which has ever
been the crux of Zoroastrianism. The question comes up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and
was the cause of many sectarian divisions among the believers. Mohammed
strongly urges the unity of God. He preaches rigid monotheism. Iblis or
satan, in his system, is a fallen angel and, unlike Ahriman, owes his existence
to God. Worshipping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> must have been the taunt hurled at the
doctors of the Zoroastrian Church by the Moslem divines. Those among the
Mazdayasnians who seem to have viewed dualism as a flaw in their religious
system apparently endeavoured to give it a monistic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> by declaring that

different opinions held in his own day, to <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for this ever-recurring
problem. Himself a Zarvanite, the author attests the existence of several
different sects, who variously held that both Ohrmazd and Ahriman have
originated from Time, or that Ohrmazd himself permitted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> to exist in

Persia, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, enables us to gain an
insight into the theological beliefs of the Zoroastrians of Persia during that
time, and as these Rivayats were compiled in India, we shall recur to them
when we discuss the Indian period.
The Zoroastrian community in Persia, during these centuries lay steeped
in the grossest ignorance and darkness. Although the condition of the
Zoroastrians in their fatherland had been growing more and more precarious,
they still had succeeded, amid chaos and confusion, in maintaining for a
considerably <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> their superiority over their Indian coreligionists in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of their sacred literature. We shall see in the subsequent
pages how the Indian Parsis had to look to the Iranians for enlightenment in
religious matters. The learned Iranian Mobad Jamasp, who came from
Kerman to Surat in 1721, found the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of the <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the
Zoroastrian priests in India so low that he resolved to impart religious
instruction to some of the leading <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> priests during the period of his stay
in the land. The Dasturs of Surat, Navsari, and Broach consequently became
his disciples;11 and the first of these, Dastur Darab, later became the teacher
of Anquetil du Perron. But the times later changed. Zoroastrian scholarship

could not thrive in Persia, as it was able to do under the conditions in India.

seen in the daily practices of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> peoples. The Hindu rises in the

his lips, the Parsi leaves his bed cursing them. One invokes them with his
uplifted hands, the other lashes them with his sacred girdle. The Hindu
anathematizes the asuras as the infernal beings, the Parsi pays his homage to
the ahuras as the celestial beings. Such is the manner in which the Indian and

[447] A period of literary arrest. The unsettled times that followed the first
settlement of the Parsis in India were unfavourable to literary activity.
Centuries <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of hardships intervened before Zoroastrianism gained a real
foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in
this new country of their adoption. Severe was the struggle and terrible was
the trial of the faithful throughout the vicissitudes of all this early period.
Poverty, an insurmountable barrier to progress of any kind, haunted the
faithful followers of Zoroaster for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> time. When we look at the
condition of the times, it is no wonder that the literary movement among the
Parsis was arrested for a considerable interval before these emigrants

succeeded in adapting themselves to the changed circumstances in which
they were placed. Religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> orally transmitted from generation to

this.

Parsi-Sanskrit literature. Some of the Parsi scholars, who frequently came
into contact with the learned Brahmans, seem to have adopted Sanskrit, the
learned language of the land, for their literary productions. The extant Parsi
literature produced in this tongue comprises the translation into Sanskrit of
the [448] greater part of the Avestan Yasna, Khordah Avesta, and Aogemadaecha, based on their Pahlavi versions; also a Sanskrit translation of the
Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> Menuk-i Khrat, Shikand Gumanik Vijar, and Arda Viraf
Namah, and the Sanskrit version of the Pazend Ashirvad [asirvad]. The most
illustrious representative of this group of Parsi Sanskritists is Neryosangh
Dhaval, who flourished about 1200 a.d. He has been one of the most
eminent doctors of the Parsi church in India, and has made the versions of
the major portion of the Zoroastrian <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> that has come down to us

to scream in terror. But Zartusht at once consoled her that nothing untoward
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> happen because the almighty befriended him. A brilliant mountain,
thereupon, descended and rent asunder the black cloud and the noxious
creatures disappeared. A radiant youthful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> holding a luminous branch,

hand, emerged from the mountain. He restored the child to the mother and
comforted [450] her that no harm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> befall the child, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> himself

to be the prophet of Ohrmazd.3

At the moment of his birth, Zartusht laughed aloud.4 The story reached the
ears of the magician Durasarun, who hastened to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Purshasp and
raised his sword to cut off the child's <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> but that instant his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> withered
away. He then ordered the child to be thrown into a pile of kindled wood,
naphtha, and sulphur, but the devouring flame became as cool as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and
the child was saved by Ohrmazd. Then the wizard threw the child into a
thoroughfare for the <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> of oxen but a leading cow <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> the child
between her forefeet and drove off all that came near, with her horns. Then
Zartusht is exposed in a narrow defile through which horses passed. A mare
at once stood at the child's <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and saved it from being trampled to death.
In the fourth attempt to destroy the child, it is put in a den of ravening
wolves. When a wolf rushed to devour Zartusht, his mouth was sewn up.
The wolves were alarmed and sat near the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of Zartusht like nurses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>
sheep came to the spot and applied their teats to the lips of Zartusht. The
sheep and the wolves all remained peacefully near him.5

Zartusht is placed under the care of a sage for instruction.6 At the age of
seven, Zartusht fell ill and the magicians <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> with medicine.
Zartusht was asked to swallow the medicine, and was told that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
deliver him from pain. Through <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> aid Zartusht knew that it was poison.
He poured it on the ground and rebuked them.7

The magicians were held in <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> honour in those <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> and Purshasp, the

Persian writers say, was also under their influence. One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he invited them
to a feast at his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and when the feast was over spoke in praise of their
work. Zartusht, thereupon, told his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> that he should abandon the
erroneous path of the wizards and turn to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for inspiration. The
magicians, he added, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> their abode in hell when they died.
Purshasp [451] was much incensed at these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and heated discussions
ensued between him and Zartusht. Purshasp and the magicians were
vanquished by the future prophet. The magicians <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in confusion
and disgrace. They fell ill and soon hurried along to the abode of
retribution.8

When Zartusht reached the age of fifteen he gave up attachment to worldly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and engaged himself in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> meditation in seclusion. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> and night
he laboured in the service of the Almighty. He fed the hungry, clothed the
naked, and helped the needy. A <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> shone round him owing to his pious

Zartusht receives revelation. At the age of thirty, one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Zartusht was
returning with his relations and companions towards Iran. They came to a
large expanse of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and there was no boat. He invoked God's help and
crossed over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> moistened only the soles
of their feet. He then met the archangel Bahman to whom he expressed his
heart's desire. Bahman asked him to close his eyes. On opening the eyes,
Zartusht found himself in the midst of the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> waited on by
celestial virgins. The angels greeted him and he conversed with God, who
taught him all sciences and everything from the beginning of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> to the
end of time. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> Zartusht's request Ohrmazd showed him Ahriman in his
gloomy abode. When the Prince of Darkness beheld Zartusht, he asked him
to turn away from the religion of Ohrmazd and promised to grant all his
earthly desires. Zartusht was then made to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> successfully through the
ordeals. On Zartusht's asking him about the symbol of religion, Ohrmazd
said that the most excellent emblem was light, from which he had created
the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> creation. Wherever there was any luminous <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> it was the
effulgence of his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> light. He instructed Zartusht in the Avesta and asked
him to recite the <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Gushtasp. Each of the other

archangels then asked Zartusht to exhort mankind to preserve the material

Zartusht at the court of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Gushtasp. Zartusht now turned his steps
towards the court of Gushtasp, when the Prince [452] of Darkness accosted
him on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> associates. He asked the prophet of Ohrmazd
to conceal the Avesta and turn away from preaching the new faith. Zartusht,
in reply, recited a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of the Avesta, which confounded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> brood.
Some fled, some dropped dead, and some pleaded for mercy. On his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
further, Zartusht met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tyrant chiefs and he asked them to embrace his
religion. They heeded not his words. Thereupon Zartusht invoked Ohrmazd
for help and a mighty wind began to blow. The stormy wind lifted up the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> infidels on <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> and kept them suspended in the air, where the birds tore
off their <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> with beaks and talons until their bones fell to the ground.
The fame of Zartusht had circulated abroad and it reached the ears of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Gushtasp. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> became anxious to see the new prophet of Ohrmazd and
when he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> that the beloved of Ohrmazd was coming, he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out from
Balkh with a numerous retinue to receive him. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> invited the sages and
philosophers to his court and no less than sixty obeyed the royal command.
When Zartusht entered the council hall he had a blazing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
which did not hurt him. He passed the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and courtiers who
held it by turn in their <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> and were, likewise, not hurt. On being asked to
produce a miracle to testify his statements, Zartusht asked molten brass to be
poured on his bosom. This was done four times and there was no trace of
burning left. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ordered the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to enter into discussion with
Zartusht. The sages questioned and Zartusht answered. They argued and he
replied. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> these sages, who had not their equals in the seven
zones of the earth, put subtle questions both theoretical and practical,
pertaining to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the next, and Zartusht gave convincing replies,
supported by a hundred irrefutable arguments and a hundred demonstrative
proofs. When he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> silenced the sages, Zartusht loosed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>

him with a special mission to the king. The Avesta, the sacred book, was
given to him by Ohrmazd for the benefit of mankind. It contained the

from that matchless book. Zartusht concluded by asking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> to embrace

that, as precipitancy in such [453] an important affair was not proper, he

Meanwhile he treated
Zartusht with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> respect and assigned to him a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> adjacent to his

They bribed the porter of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in which the

Zartusht sitting by the side of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and reading the Avesta to him. They
boldly approached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and said that the new-comer was a magician and

They soon returned with the impure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and exposed them to the royal

prison in chains. A loaf of bread and a pitcher of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> were carried to him

so grieved that he did not partake of any food. General mourning prevailed
at the royal court. When Zartusht learnt from the porter about the malady of
the horse, he sent a message to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> that he could restore the health of
the royal horse. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ordered Zartusht to be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into his presence.
He seated him by his side and said that if he could restore the steed to
perfect health, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> believe him to be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> prophet, sent by Ohrmazd.
Zartusht demanded that if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> engaged to perform four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

accepted Zartusht's conditions. The first condition made by Zartusht was
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> should make his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and tongue of one accord and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
doubt and equivocation, <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> with the tongue and repeat with the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span>
that Zartusht was the prophet and messenger sent by God. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> agreed

and Zartusht addressed his prayer to Ohrmazd and rubbed the right foot of
the [454] horse with his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> joy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and courtiers
and soldiers, it straight away came out. Zartusht then demanded that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> should command prince Isfendiar to gird up his loins to propagate the
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Ohrmazd. This being accepted, Zartusht invoked Ohrmazd and the
right hind leg came out. The prophet's <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> demand was that the queen
should embrace his faith. The queen accepted the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> with <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
and in all sincerity and Zartusht prayed and the other hind leg came out.
Then the prophet asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> the porter and inquire of him how
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> for magical preparations entered his house. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> told the

The
unfortunate chamberlain did save his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by giving out the truth. Zartusht
recited the sacred formula and the other fore-foot came out and the swift
charger once again stood on his legs. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> kissed the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of
Zartusht, begged his pardon and seated him on the throne near himself.
Zartusht then cured the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and brother of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Gushtasp of the serious

now asked Zartusht to secure for him four boons from Ohrmazd. The first
was that he should <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t11 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t26 hoverable">behold</span> his own <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> in the next world, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> was
that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> should be invulnerable, the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> that he might learn all
mysteries of life, and the fourth that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> might remain united to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

Gushasp dressed in green, and fully armed, came on horseback to the court
of Gushtasp. They declared that they were the envoys of God, who had
commissioned them to give the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> message that Zartusht was

bowed his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> and said that he was the Lord's servant and had girt up his
loins to execute his commands. The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> messengers then departed. The

During this period his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> ascended to the heaven, traversed the

consecrated milk to [455] Peshotan who became deathless to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of

A grain of the consecrated pomegranate was given to Isfendiar. He ate it and
instantly became brazen-bodied. The prophet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> divided the four boons

the king, it was not proper to confer all the four incomparable boons on one

Zartusht's fabled religious debate with Indian and Greek sages. It is said
that there lived a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sage named Changranghacha in India at this time. He
claimed many foreign pupils of distinction and Jamasp was one of them.
When the news of the conversion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Gushtasp reached him he wrote an
epistle to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and dissuaded him from embracing the new faith. On the
invitation of the king, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> philosopher came to Balkh with his disciples
to hold a disputation with Zartusht and refute his doctrines. Learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
from various parts of the country attended the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> debate. Before the sage
propounded his questions, Zartusht ordered one of his disciples to read a
Nask. Herein were already recorded all the questions that the Indian sage
was to ask as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the answers to them. The sage was utterly confused and
he saw that the new prophet had premonition and he knew beforehand what
particular questions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be put to him. He acknowledged his defeat and
accepted Zartusht as the prophet of God. He embraced the new religion,
<span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a copy of the Avesta with him to India and converted in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

When the news that Changranghacha was defeated by Zartusht [456]
reached abroad, another Indian controversialist, Bias by name, came to the
court of Gushtasp. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> organized a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> assemblage to which the

learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> came from distant lands. Bias opened the debate and addressing
Zartusht said that he had <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> that the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> Changranghacha had adopted
the new faith. He had <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> in his country, of the many miracles performed
by the new prophet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he challenged him to disclose the secret
thoughts he had kept pent up in his bosom and had not transferred from his
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> to his lips. Zartusht, thereupon, <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> out a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> sent to him
before the coming of Bias to Iran. He then read out all that was concealed in
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> of Bias, with the appropriate explanations. Bias was at once
convinced of the superhuman <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of Zartusht and became an ardent
follower of his religion. Tutianush or Niyatus was the other philosopher who
was sent by the eminent sages of Greece to interrogate the prophet about
the tenets of his faith. The distinguished Greek seer was at once convinced
of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> insight of Zartusht when he beheld his face. Zartusht asked him
to keep in his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> whatever he desired to inquire, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had already
acquainted him with it. One of his disciples then read out aloud all that was
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of Tutianush. The Greek sage adopted the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Gushtasp appointed him the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of the priests in his country, where he
propagated Zartusht's religion.14

Zartusht's death. When Arjasp invaded Balkh for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> time, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Gushtasp, as the Persian writers record, was partaking of the hospitality of
Zal in Seistan. A Turk named Tur-baratur entered Zartusht's oratory and the
prophet received his martyrdom by his sword. Zartusht, however, threw the
rosary that was in his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> at the assailant. An effulgent splendor proceeded

Rivayats, or codes of usages and rituals. We have again to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> over a
period of about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries, or from about the thirteenth century to the

latter part of the fifteenth century, before we come across a further record of
literary activity. After the convulsions that the small band of fugitives
experienced, they had settled down as the tillers of the fields, sellers of liquor
and toddy, as minor traders and merchants, or as members of petty
professions. By this time, however, the Parsis of Gujarat had begun fairly to
prosper. Some of them had even succeeded in building up modest fortunes,
and had spread abroad their fame for liberality. This beginning of the
economic welfare of the community shows the first signs of the new life, and
among these signs was the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the community began eagerly to turn its
attention to the necessity of gaining authentic information on the religious
questions about which they were in doubt. The Parsis of India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that
their co-religionists living in Persia must be better informed on religious
matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition
more faithfully than they themselves did. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> drew up certain
religious questions on which they needed enlightenment, and in 1478
commissioned a daring Parsi to go to Persia and lay their questions before
the learned Dasturs of their fatherland. The news that a band of fugitives
lived in India who were one in <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> with them, and shared their common
traditions, had <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> since filtered through to the Zoroastrians of Persia. In
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> it is possible that the connection between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> bands of the faithful,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> imperfect, had never been quite broken. Intercourse through trade, as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as other factors, must have helped to keep up some connection. Great,
therefore, was the enthusiasm caused by the fresh opening of a closer
communication with them; and for nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries (1478-1766), a
more immediate interchange of views <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between the Zoroastrians of
India and Persia. [458] No less than twenty-two messengers had <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> India
during this period with questions pertaining to ritual observances,
ceremonial ablutions, purificatory rites, forms of worship, rules of adoption
and marriage and other miscellaneous subjects. These collections of
traditions, customs, and rites, arranged in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of questions and answers,
are composed in Persia, which became the literary language of the Parsi
scholars under the influence of the Moslem rule in Gujarat. These
compilations are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Rivayats, and provide a wealth of information on
liturgical and social matters.1 Side by side with a score of important subjects,
the disquisitions sometimes fall to the level of barren theological
disputations. Among such discussions, for example, were points like these:

Whether the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> could be copied with ink prepared by a nonZoroastrian, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the faithful be polluted by conversing with the nonZoroastrians while they are carrying a dead body, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> a Mobad who has

curse. It came to be believed that the Yasna sacrifices [459] offered in the

and other sainted dead persons, could thwart the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> designs of their

Bull's urine, or golden water, as it is now called, has been an indispensable
article in the purificatory rites and ceremonial ablutions among the
Zoroastrians from the earliest times. From the strong belief in the efficacy of
its giving external bodily purification, it was but a step to the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of
attributing to it the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of purifying the internal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of man. A most
extravagant sanctity came to be attached to the drinking of it. Elaborate
rituals are now performed over the liquid and the drinking of this
consecrated fluid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an indissoluble part of certain Zoroastrian
ceremonials. The Rivayats tell us that the drink gives <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glory, and makes

Bull's urine has been, since <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times, an essential auxiliary of spells or

time, and the term nirang, which originally meant spell only, now signifies
both spell and bull's urine, and henceforth conveys both the meanings. Such
in general is the <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> that we gather from the Rivayats regarding the
conditions prevailing in that period.

Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are translated into Persian with the help of their Pahlavi

The allegorical method of interpreting religious texts. From very early
times some theologians of both the East and the West [462] have maintained
that the prophets adapt themselves to the mode of thinking of the masses
and <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> parables and legends to express their views. The sacred texts, they

say, are <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which contains a double meaning, the one is the
surface meaning, which can be understood by the masses, and the other is
the inner or hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> meant for the initiated. The Sophists and Stoics
resorted to the method of allegorically interpreting Greek mythology to
meet the attacks of sceptical criticism. The Alexandrian Jewish and Christian
theologians, Philo and Origen, spoke of the literal and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> meanings of
the sacred books. The first, they wrote, was the bodily part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> meant
for the majority and the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> was its <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> part which was understood
by those few who could <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the revealed kernel, hidden by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the outer
textual shell. The Gnostics and the Neo-Platonists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attempted to explain
Oriental and Occidental myths by allegorical interpretation. The Ismailis,
the Sect of the Seven and other schools that flourished in Iran from the ninth
century, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> themselves the Bâtinis or the esoterics as opposed to the
Zâhiris or the exoterics or literalists. Their method of interpreting the sacred
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> on the allegorical basis is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> tâ’wil.
This method of interpreting religious <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> persists throughout the various
periods of the history of the religions of the world. Legends and myths,
traditional dogmas and superstitious customs, historical errors and textual
discrepancies, primitive beliefs and practices are all invested with the
mysterious meanings. Statements which often repel both <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> and
conscience <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> an easy expedient in allegory. The esoterics generally seek in
the sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> what their own thinking is willing to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> and read in them
what is rooted in their minds. They read the subjective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> into the
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> and draw unwarranted implications from them. Forces of nature,
animate or inanimate objects are all given a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> and explained as

allegorizing extravagances.

to have been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down in the reign of Khusru Parviz and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to throw a

the appearance of this work. One party of eminent European scholars
declared it to be a fraudulent forgery, while others of equal eminence
endeavoured to prove its authenticity. The claim of the Desatir to have been
<span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in a celestial language was put to a crucial test. Patient research has
since declared the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> to be an exotic, outside the pale of Zoroastrianism.
And so it has been held by all Iranian scholars both of East and West.1

work, on the contrary, gives a regular hierarchy of prophets who are
supposed to have preceded the first man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> first revealed his secrets to
one Mahabad, who was followed by thirteen other prophets in the former

came down to Gayomard and his descendants. It is alleged in this book,
moreover, that all the early Pishdadian kings conformed to this religion of
Mahabad, until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that Zoroaster came and preached his
fundamentally new religion. But even the new prophet's religion, we are told,
was so glossed over by the Yazdanians, the followers of Mahabad, that
Zoroastrianism was ultimately made to confer to the Mahabadian code.2

India by Mohsan Fani in the seventeenth century, draws the greater part of
its materials from the Desatir. The author of this composition mentions some
fourteen sects into which he finds the Zoroastrians of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> divided. These
are the Sipasian, Abadian, Jamshaspian, Samradian, Khodaiyan, [464]
Radian, Shidrangian, Paikarian, Milanian, Alarian, Shidabian, Akhshiyan,
Zardushtian, and Mazdakian. Several of these sects are stated to have
flourished from very remote times, going back to the Pahlavi and Avestan
periods, nay stretching even back to a period of which history has not a

With the exception of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> works, however, we have no

inkling of other sects in the genuine Iranian texts. The statements contained
in them are not corroborated by any authority in the writings of the
Zoroastrian priests. They do not mention them by name, they are entirely
unaware of their existence. The <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the majority of these sects, as
found in the Dabistan, is very meagre. We meet with some attempts in them
to explain the primordial principle from which <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> came into being, and
we have some sort of crude metaphysics grafted on physics. Sun, fire, air,
nature, water, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> are alternately put forward as having been the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> sources of existence according to various schools of thinkers.3
Others still preach a strict monism, and assume that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of phenomena
was caused by illusion.4 The teachings of the Yazdanians and others are
characterized by a belief in metempsychosis, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the efficiency of
rigorous austerities and ascetic virtues. Our present concern, however, is
with the author's <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Zoroastrian mystics, and we shall now turn
to the matter immediately.

Zoroastrian mystics. At this period we meet with some Parsi thinkers who
were not satisfied with the formal side of religion, and looked with
indifference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the ritual observances, Outward formalism and literal
interpretation of the teachings of the prophet failed to meet with the
longings of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of mystic temperament. They ever remained in search
of mysteries hidden beneath the outward garb of dogmas and rituals. The
Parsi priesthood could not satisfy the wants of such ecstatic enthusiasts.
They revolted from authority, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> about thinking for themselves. These
dissenters as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lived a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> different from that led by their neighbours.
Many of them found consolation in the teachings of the Hindu Yogis and
became their willing disciples. Under these circumstances we have to turn to
the Dabistan for the general information of this sect, as the historic Parsi
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> are silent over the question and do not even notice its existence.
[465] Azar Kaivan and his disciples. The author of the Dabistan gives us an
elaborate <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Zoroastrian mystics whom he met in Patna, in
Kashmir, and in Lahore during the seventeenth century.5 The most illustrious
of these mystic teachers was Dastur Azar Kaivan who came from Persia and

settled in Patna,6 and lived for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in seclusion far from the public gaze.7
Some of the most prominent disciples of this recluse sage were the Mobads
Farzan Bahram of Shiraz, Hushiyyar of Surat, Sarosh, and Khuda Jui. They
extravagantly trace their lineage back to Ma-habad, to Sam, Godrej, Rustam,
Jamasp, Zoroaster, and Noshirvan. Let us now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to a brief notice of the
literary activity of these hermit priests.

Mystic literature during the period. These Parsi mystics composed several
treatises in Persian, which, as we have already seen, was the literary medium
of this period. Among the more important <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> come down
to us are Jam-i Kaikhusru, Makashefat-i Kaivani, Khishtab, Zaredasht Afshar,
and Zindah Rud. The author of the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> allege that their <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> are
translations into Persian from the original Pahlavi books <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
of the Sasanian kings Hormazd and Khusru Parviz. A search through the
literary content of these writings, however, shows that their philosophical
dissertations mostly reproduce the teachings of Greek philosophy, current in
India in the seventeenth century through its Arabic version. For instance, the
Khishtab opens with the prophet Mahabad's descriptions of the four
generative principles of things, which are nothing else but the material,
formal, efficient, and final causes of Aristotle. The authors fantastically credit
the legendary and real kings and princes of Persia with the philosophical
ideas, which on very little examination can easily be traced to their original
Greek sources. These royal personages are styled prophets or seers and
depicted as advancing some original argument for the proof of the existence
of God, his <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> attributes, and regarding other kindred subjects. Even the
warrior heroes Zal and Rustam seem occasionally to have proclaimed a truce
to warfare, and to have devoutly sat down in more peaceful pursuit of
metaphysical investigations; for some of the philosophical disquisitions stand
in their names too.
[466] The alleged twofold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Avesta. These esoteric
interpreters of the sacred <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> asserted that Zoroaster had couched his
teachings in figurative and enigmatic language.8 The Zoroastrian scriptures
were accordingly divided into 'Great Zend' and 'Little Zend,'9 the first being
followed by the adepts and initiates, and the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> by the masses.. The

figurative language of the former hid the deeper truths from the ignorant.

The author, then, cites some instances and explains the difference between
the exoteric and the esoteric interpretations of the Avestan texts. For
instance; when it is said that the archangel Bahman held a conference with
Zoroaster and asked him to close his eyes, the vulgar, according to the
Dabistan, understand that Bahman assumed <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and addressed the
prophet like a mortal; but the adept is to understand by this that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
essence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was uncompounded, and that under such a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> Bahman
manifested himself before Zoroaster, and his asking the prophet to close his
<span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> means only that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> asked him to eradicate all bodily attachment
and suppress carnal desires of the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to enable him to get a vision
of the archangel.10 When the Zoroastrian <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> seem to sanction animal
slaughter, it is to be understood as an injunction to kill the animal
propensities inherent in man.11 The author states further that the passages
which <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the hermits as partaking of animal <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> in reasonable bounds
are not to be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> literally. These simply refer to the gradual control and
ultimate killing of the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in man.12 The legend that Ahriman
appeared at a season festival in the guise of a glutton and devoured
everything to the utter confusion of the assembly, until he was routed by
preparing a dish from the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> of a certain red cow, mixed with vinegar,
garlic, and rue, at the instance of some miraculous advice, may be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by
the masses as literally true. But any one versed in esoteric wisdom, and
acquained with the doctrines inculcated by the Dabistan, knows that the
killing of the red cow stands for the suppression of the sensual appetite,
vinegar for the virtue of abstinence, garlic for reflection, and rue for silent
reflection. All these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> kill Ahrimanian propensities in man.13 The
ignorant invest Ahriman with a personality; but, really [467] speaking, he has
no independent existence, for he is not an entity and is simply the negation
of existence.14 The aggregate of bodily passions and sensual appetites is
symbolically termed Ahriman, named from the originator of evil,15 and
Ahriman's predominance in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to exist only for a limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> while
the tumult of youth in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the bodily passions in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> are in the
ascendency and until they are ultimately curbed and eradicated.16 Again, the
sacred books <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of Ahriman as the creator of serpents and scorpions. But

these noxious creatures, according to this treatise, are nothing but allegorical
expressions for the vices and passions that haunt the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind.17 All such
persons as stick to the exoteric interpretation of the scriptures believe that
Zohak actually carried <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> serpents on his shoulders, but the adept
understand the statement as applying to the venomous tyranny and
sensuality of the wicked usurper.18 The legend of the flight of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Kaus to
the heavens, his fall, and the subsequent restoration of this lost monarch to
his kingdom by Rustam, has likewise an esoteric interpretation. The four
eagles that carried the misguided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> up in the air, along with his
throne, signify the four elements. The throne, explains the author, stands for
the predominant bodily passions, the ascent means that a devotee can rise to
a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of existence by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of abstinence and austerity, the fall
denotes the revolt of the passions owing to some neglect in the observance

speaks equally of Parsi adepts who were in constant touch with such Hindu
monks.39 He further mentions a Parsi ascetic who moved about in Gujarat

RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSIES
Theological disputations. We <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> from the extent Persian literature that the
writers of this period occupied themselves in minute quibbling and barren
discussions of the ritualistic ceremonies and purificatory rites. There is no
trace of original thinking on vital problems. Their energy was wholly
expended on endless wranglings about dogmas and theological disquisitions.

relatives of the dead had under these circumstances to carry dead bodies to

1. Patell, Parsi Prakash, 1, 23, Bombay, 1888. Intercalation controversy
provides a powerful incentive to the study of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Zoroastrian
scriptures. In 1720 were planted seeds of a controversy' which gave,
however, a real and abiding impetus to religious studies. A learned Mobad
named Jamasp, who came to India from Persia, in 1721, found that the Indian
Parsis were one month behind the Zoroastrians of Persia in the calculation of
their year, and he strongly advocated a reform in the matter. The question at
first did not arouse much attention, but later it developed into a serious
problem that led to a display of strong passion and to the exchange of bitter
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> on both sides in the community. Learned priests in each party
zealously turned to the study of the original scriptures, as a source to decide
the matter, and the question was threshed out in detail, accompanied by the
publication of innumerable tracts [471]and pamphlets. While the learned in
the community were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> engaged in ransacking their <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> records, the
masses <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up the controversy acrimoniously, resorting to abuses and sometimes even to blows. The Shahinshahis, or the Imperials, represented the old

order, and the dissenters styled themselves the Kadimis, or the Ancients. The
former annoyed the latter by their mocking derision. Social intercourse
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> became most strained, the community was split into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
sects, and separate places of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> were founded. The division of the
community into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects endures to the present day, but despite the

have obliterated the bitter feelings. Modern researches have proved that
both the parties were wrong in their calculations. The accidentals of the
controversy have changed during the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> period of hard-fought battles, but
the main question has still remained as unsettled as before. Among the chief
causes that have contributed to the indefinite postponement of the reform
are the indifference and apathy of the community. The question is looked at
with misgivings, as not falling in the arena of practical reform, because
fraught with many complications. What we are more concerned with is, that
the controversy gave new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to literary activities, and encouraged studious

PROSELYTIZING COMES TO BE VIEWED WITH DISFAVOUR

seen that the handful of the Parsi fugitives who emigrated to India after the
final overthrow of the Persian empire in the middle of the seventh century
had to <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> enormous difficulties in the earlier centuries of their settlement in
the new home. The precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former
proselytizing zeal. The instinctive <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of disintegration and absorption in
the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
exclusiveness and a strong feeling for the preservation of the racial
characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an
atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own
safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers.
The community was divided regarding the question of admitting lower
classes of aliens into its fold. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the practice of an active religious

not seem to have died out entirely, for we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> recorded in the Rivayat
literature that a heated polemic regarding the subject was carried on during
the latter part of the eighteenth century. With the beginning of economic
prosperity, the Indian Parsis, we learn, were in the habit of purchasing male
and female slaves of low Hindu castes. These slaves, in many cases, were
invested with sacred shirt and girdle and admitted into the Zoroastrian fold
by the priests at the request of their masters. Those members of the
community who were opposed to the mingling of their blood with that of
such a low class of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> denied to these converts the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> privileges of a

for their advice and decision in the matter. The point made by those who
favoured the cause of the [475]the converts was that the Parsis of India who
owned slaves for their <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> not only often had them admitted to the
Mazdayasnian <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in accordance with the tenets of the religion, but also,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> and religious scruples, partook of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> prepared by them, and even
permitted them, at the season festival to prepare the sacred cakes <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> for
consecration and sacrificial purposes. It was urged that having allowed the
converted slaves all such rights of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Zoroastrian in their lifetime, certain

deposited in the Tower of Silence when they died. The Iranian <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> priests,
in replying to their inquiring brothers in India advised them in the beginning

to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> precautionary measures in all such conversions that no harm should
thereby be done to the religion and to the community. It was certainly an act
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit, they proceeded, to purchase alien <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> and <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> them up
as Zoroastrians. It was unfair and highly objectionable, they added, nay it
was an inexpiable sin, to refuse these unfortunate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> all the privileges of
a believer after once admitting them into the Zoroastrian religious fold. It is
taught by the scriptures, they argued, that all mankind will be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> over
to the religion of Mazda in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the future saviour prophets. It was,
therefore, the pious duty of every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Zoroastrian to help this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cause by
leading all to the path of righteousness. In the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of such commands, they
concluded, those who denied to the proselytes the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> rights of a faithful
believer did not deserve to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zoroastrians. On another occasion in
reply to a question about the conversion of such low-class people, the
Iranian informant wrote that even a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who dug graves or followed the
profession of burning the dead (two inexpiable sins according to
Zoroastrianism), should be admitted into the Zoroastrian fold, provided his
admittance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be harmful to the faith.
The <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> that the community might be swamped by the undesirable alien
element was a <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> why proselytizing fell into disfavour. We notice in
that discussion that the different sections of the community were divided
more on the social side of the question of proselytizing than on its religious
side. The protest was chiefly based against the admixture of racial blood that
the low class of the aliens introduced into the community. The Zoroastrians
of Persia, who were trampled under the iron [476]foot of their Moslem
conquerors and had lived in servile state, saw no objection whatsoever in
receiving converts even from the lowest strata of the non-Zoroastrian
peoples. But the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> was different with the Indian Parsis, among whom the
improved social and economic conditions had aroused a keen <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of racial
pride and <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of their past greatness. A very considerable portion
of the community, it seems, looked with disapproval <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the introduction
of the undesirable element of alien races into their small numbers. This
strong feeling was aggravated the more through the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that such converts
who sought admission came always from the lowest classes. Members of the
upper classes of the non-Zoroastrian communities were not <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> knocking
at the door of the Mazdayasnian fire-temples seeking admission. The

community was not disposed to any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of active religious propaganda. The
cases of conversion were consequently confined either to the slaves <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
up in Parsi families or to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> to Parsi <span class="t3 hoverable">fathers</span> of their nonZoroastrian mistresses. Proselytizing came to be associated with the low type
of foreign element, and fell into disrepute. A beginning of opposition to the
<span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of religious propaganda was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> made when the entire question of
proselytizing came to be looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> by the community with disfavour. No
serious attempt has since been made by the Parsis of India to organize a
proselytizing movement with the sole <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of propagating their faiths But
the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> on the part of some Zoroastrians to include in the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span>

people, and several portions of the Persian Rivayats had already been done
into Gujarati. These were followed during the early part of the last century
by a Gujarati version of the Avestan texts, not from the original, but based
on the Pahlavi, Sanskrit, and Persian renderings. This was the last native
attempt to render the Avestan scriptures into another language through the
medium of the Pahlavi translation. The Sanskrit, Persian, and Gujarati
translators had all successively made their renderings on the basis of the
traditional Pahlavi version; it was <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> for the modern philologists to
approach the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in the original itself, independently of the

Rustam Peshutan Hamajiar in the early part of the eighteenth century1. The
Gujarati version of the Avesta was soon followed by a translation of some of

these were Jamaspi and Arda Viraf Namah. The prognostications of the
former treatise fascinated the gentler sex, who were regaled by the recital of
its contents from the lips of the family priest, [478]or of some male member
of the family who happened to know the language. Viraf's <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the

and verse, appeared during this period. In the same connection, it may be
added that the episodes of the Persian kings and warriors, handed down from
antiquity by tradition, were rendered into Gujarati, and were most enthusiastically read or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> by all. This helped to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> home to them the greatness

knowledge. It knows no end and is ever new. It adapts itself to the times and
satisfies the cravings of the thinking minds. From the earliest times, religion
spoke with authority on matters relating to the spirit. But there were <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
problems for which the inquisitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> always demanded solution. Science
claimed to make new discoveries in the realm of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> researches.
Religion adopted science as its handmaid and incorporated the discoveries of
the scientists and the physicists and proclaimed them as the further <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
revelation to mankind to explain <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> questions. The crude cosmologies
and cosmogonies of the times when science was in its infancy were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
made integral parts of the religions of the world. The researches of modern
science have rendered them untenable in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of advanced knowledge.
The doctrine of evolution has revolutionized man's outlook <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
throughout the world. Modern science has changed the attitude of the
thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> everywhere. The intellectual ferment and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> unrest
have stirred the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world. The enlightened youths are driven to disbelief.
They are not happy in the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of disbelief. They are anxious to believe and
secure peace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> but they cannot honestly subscribe to the beliefs in
which they are <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up. They are disbelievers despite themselves. This
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of disbelief is produced by honest doubt.
Orthodoxy is obstinacy to forget anything old and learn anything new.
Orthodoxy has always and everywhere professed that the doctrines, dogmas,
rituals, and the established views of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> has inherited are fixed
and right. All those that dissent from them are heterodox, other than right,
not right, [482]that is, wrong. Orthodoxy has always numbers on its side, for
the average <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is temperamentally timid and conservative and is unwilling
to be disturbed in the thoughts and views he has inherited with his birth. He
seeks refuge in tradition and is content to live secure in the dead past. All
that is handed down from remote times and forms the tradition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

is sacred. Orthodoxy is jealous of the views it holds and resents all
opposition to them. It aims at making <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> religious in its own way. It
moves about with prying <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and spies on its neighbour's conscience and
struggles to read his thoughts. Whenever it is powerful enough to inflict its
will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> others, it clips the wing of thought, gags speech, and cripples
action. The collective orthodox <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> controls the thinking of the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
and drives the dissenters to secrete their thoughts in the lowest depths of
their souls. Orthodoxy makes <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> thinking taboo and fails to see that <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
thinking is impossible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> thinking. Orthodoxy is impervious to the

THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING AMONG THE PARSIS
Awakening of the communal conscience. The advent of the British in India,
and an era of peace, justice, and security of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and property, ushered in by
them, opened a new page in the history of the Parsis. Having a ready scope,
the means of adaptation, and also elasticity in their religion, they now began
to assert their latent capacity, and soon emerged from the obscurity in which
they had lived, to become henceforth the foremost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in India in matters
educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress,
amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity.
This unprecedented economic prosperity helped the revival of learning
among the Zoroastrians. The new epoch of the revival of learning gave new
hopes for a period of formation and life. Various educational institution had
been founded, and the Parsis faced the problem of the responsibility of
universal franchise in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of letters. The average Parsi child of both the
sexes entered the schools founded on European lines by the community
during the first half of the last century, in various centres of Parsi population,
and education on Western standards spread with accelerated rapidity.
The new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> profoundly modified the religious conceptions of the
young. The inroads of Western ideas and culture undermined the old ideals,
and modified many of the beliefs sanctified by ages. It was the opening of a
new age for the Parsis, in which they witnessed the waning of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of

authority and the waxing of the demand for the verification of religious
truths. The transition from the old to the new was bound to be disruptive.
The new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> that had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> hold of the community stirred it to its lowest
depth. It threatened the community with an intellectual revolt from the new
school. The reaction was bound to come, and come it did. It was violent as
all reaction is apt to be, and it ended in indifferentism. The [484]popular
creed as propounded by the traditionalist exponents and orthodox formalists
failed to carry conviction to their intellect. They wanted to verify their
doubts and refused to believe that which, as they said, was not in accord
with reason. The glowing accounts of the reward and retribution of the
materialized <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and hell ceased to act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the imagination of the
educated classes. The imaginings of Viraf failed to exert any restraining
influence over the tendency to sin. The inspired visions of this seer, about
the scenes of the hereafter, depicting the pleasures of the souls of the <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span>
in paradise and the agonies of the wicked in hell, which satisfied the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
cravings of their elders for ages, failed longer so to do in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the new
generation. The waters of Ardvisur had inundated the regions of hell and
quenched the blazing fire, the horrors of hell had vanished into thin air, and
the apocalyptic <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Viraf no longer presented to the minds of the
enlightened youth what they had to the strictly orthodox. A treatment of the
unfortunate souls, such as was portrayed traditionally, seemed to them
monstrous, and subverting man's <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the goodness of Ohrmazd. They
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> them to be crude and archaic. The germs of new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> were
sprouting among the young, and they viewed these theological problems
with a changed attitude. They gradually became estranged from all beliefs
that had been instilled into them from childhood. They aimed at reconciling
religion and contemporary knowledge, and bringing religious beliefs and
practices into closer relation with the intellectual ways and thought. Parsi
orthodoxy resented it.
An illiterate priesthood failed to satisfy the intellectual wants of the
enlightened youth. The Parsi priesthood had <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before degenerated into
ignorance. The situation was not keenly felt so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the laity was equally
illiterate. But now when the latter sought enlightenment, the clergy had kept
less and less abreast of the times. During the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> period of twelve centuries,
very few priests rose above mediocrity. The priest hitherto had acted as an

intercessor between the layman and Ohrmazd, and through elaborate ritual
had undertaken to gain for him <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> help, being duly paid to recite
penitential prayers for the expiation of the sins of the living, and to <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
for the purchase of paradise for the dead. The youth of the new school
argued that there was no more need of the Mobad's mediation between him
[485]and his Heavenly Father. He demanded that the priest should act as a
moral preceptor, a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ministrant to his soul. This, in those times, the
priest could not do. He could not widen his religious outlook and adapt
himself to the demand of the younger generation. The youth now grew up
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> religious instruction and gradually gravitated towards indifferentism.
The apathy, callousness, and disregard towards religion on the part of the
educated youth waxed stronger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by day, and culminated in an
atmosphere of agnosticism that withered the beliefs in which they were
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up. Agnosticism became the threatening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> of the day.

INTRODUCTION OF THE WESTERN METHOD OF IRANIAN
SCHOLARSHIP IN INDIA
Parsi scholarship at this period. Up to that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> had been
almost wholly interpreted by the Zoroastrian authorities through the help of
their Pahlavi translations. The original Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> had remained largely
unintelligible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the Pahlavi version. It was not then known that the
Gathas were composed in metre, much less the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that some other minor
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> were also metrical. The rudiments of Avestan grammar that various
inflections modified the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> had been a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> forgotten fact.
This was due to the circumstance that, owing to the inflectional poverty of
the Pahlavi language, the translators had resorted to the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of particles and
very often had even dropped this only means of indicating the syntactical
relation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in a sentence, and had contented themselves with
rendering an inflected Avestan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> by its uninflected crude Pahlavi
equivalent. Firdausi and other Moslem writers were the sole informants of
the Parsi scholars regarding the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> and legendary history of Iran. As
these did not record the doings of the Achaemenian kings, the Parsi

community remained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any inkling of the greatness and <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of the

information that there once flourished a mighty dynasty of rulers whom the
modern Parsi can claim as his kith and kin. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> had been denied for

when comparative philology came to its aid from the West and opened a
new era of critical study in the field of Iranian researches.
Introduction of the science of comparative philology among the Parsis.
Since the year 1771, when that worthy pioneer of romantic renown in
Iranian studies, Anquetil du Perron, published his volumes containing the
first European translation of the Avesta, or Sacred <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">Book</span> of Zoroaster, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
strides forward have been made in Europe and America in the realm of
Iranian research. The field is now replete with the lasting monuments of
Western scholarship <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> in the department of standard editions of the
sacred <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> or the compilation of grammars and dictionaries or again in the
preparation of scientific translations as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in making exegetical,
philological and archeological researches. The service that these scholars
have rendered to the Parsis is greater than can ever be expressed. To K. R.
Kama, Parsi pioneer of the Iranian studies on Western lines in India, who had
studied the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in Europe under the German savant Spiegel, is due
the credit of introducing among Parsi scholars the science of comparative
philology and the scientific method of interpreting their sacred books. The
inauguration of this new era belongs to the early part of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> half of
the last century.

Textual criticism brings startling revelation for the Parsis. The first
outcome of the critical study of the Avestan literature, as may be judged
from intimations given above, was the discovery made by the Western
scholars that the grammar, style, and internal evidence of the extant Avestan
<span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> show that they were not composed at a single period and by one
person, but that they were the products of many persons who worked at
various times. Scholars such as these undertook to determine the
approximate dates of the component parts of the Avesta. The Gathas were
shown to be the oldest in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of composition and the authorship of a
considerable portion, if not all, of these [488]hymns was ascribed to
Zoroaster himself.. The prophet's work, it was said, was continued by his
immediate disciples, and must have extended over a very <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> period after
him, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the immediate impression made by Zoroaster himself may
be acknowledged to have become fainter in succeeding generations. The
religion of the Younger Avesta had departed in certain respects from the
religion of the Gathas, and the subsequent compositions showed signs of
degeneration both in substance and style. The simple and abstract <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
the Gathas was blurred if not lost, and the development of the later <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
tended to become more complex and concrete. We breathe a different
atmosphere, they declared, when we <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> from the Gathic to the Later
Avestan field. Nature-worship, which Zoroaster strove to supplant by a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> type of ethical religion, was shown to have been reinstated in these
later texts. The masses could not be weaned from the beliefs that loomed
large in their eyes, and thus, the scholars maintained, many practices
abolished by Zoroaster were later resuscitated by the clergy. Startling indeed
were these new ideas that philological re searches <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the Parsis, who
had been accustomed to at tribute indiscriminately all Avestan compositions
to Zoroaster himself and who never approached their own sacred books with
a historical perspective.
Back to the Gathas was the war-cry of the new school. This critical
estimate of their scripture by the Iranian scholars of the West greatly
influenced the young Parsi scholars in India. They now hailed the Gathas as
providing a self-sufficient religious system in themselves. They claimed to
have discovered the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mirror in which the genuine teachings of
Zoroaster were, reflected. The Later Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> were declared to render

nugatory the pristine purity. An exuberant outgrowth of dogmatic theology
and ceremonial observances, they asserted, had supplanted the buoyant
simplicity of the Gathic teachings, and simply' represented a decline from
the pure teachings of Zoroaster. The names of the Amshaspands in the
Gathas were considered to be merely descriptive of the attributes of
Ohrmazd. These attributes, they insisted, had crystallized into concrete
beings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> converting the monotheistic religion of Zoroaster into a
veritable system of polytheism. Tradition, they argued, attributed to
Zoroaster doctrines that he never preached. They advocated a return to the
[489]original purity of the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> by stripping off the accretions that had
gathered round the pure canon of the prophet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> removing the haze of
ignorance and bigotry that had overclouded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of their excellent
religion. All this was highly sacrilegious to orthodox ears. Such statements
roused the strong resentment of the community and elicited vehement
protests from priests and laymen alike. The new school was assailed on all
sides. More sober opinion intervened to modify the sweeping assertions, and
declared that while the Gathas, of course, should be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as the norm, there
should also be admitted into the Zoroastrian canon such parts of the later
scriptures as were in accord with the Gathic spirit; but whatever could not be
traced to the Gathas was adventitious, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> not deserving of
acceptance. The problem at once arose as to who was going to distinguish
the authoritative from the un-authoritative and a new controversy opened
amid still more bitter feelings.
A new theory to defend the Gathas from the accusation of dualism. The
salient feature of dualism in the Iranian <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> has ever been the chief point
assailed by the non-Zoroastrians, both in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> and modern times,
whenever they have entered into religious disputations with the followers of
the prophet. They have laid the doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to the charge of
Zoroastrianism. The accidentals of the controversy have varied materially in
their character at different periods, but the main point of contention has ever
remained the same. We have already seen how vehemently the learned
prelates of the Pahlavi period strove to vindicate this characteristic feature of
the Zoroastrian teachings. Far from considering it a weak point, they hailed
it the only possible solution of the problem of evil. Not so their modern
descendants. The repeated attack of the Christian missionaries, and the

strong influence of the Western literature, which hailed monotheism as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> category of theology, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about an unprecedented change in
this belief; and so powerful has this influence been, that we hardly ever <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
even at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> any learned Parsi priest or layman marshalling arguments in
vindication of the doctrine. Attempts are now generally made either to
explain it away by ingenious arguments or to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of it apologetically. Haug
was the first to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> it to the notice of the Parsis that [490]the leading <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
of the Gathas was monotheism. Ahura Mazda, he declared, is the supreme
godhead, who has produced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival principles Spenta Mainyu and
Angra Mainyu as his twin spirits. Separated as they seem, they are united in
action. They are indispensable to each other in the formation and conduct of
the universe. They are the creative and the destroying, constructive and
destructive powers of God, and are as inseparable from each other as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and
night. The opposition rests with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival spirits, and nowhere in the
Gathas does Angra Mainyu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> Spirit, stand in direct opposition to
Ahura Mazda. This fundamental distinction, he said, is lost sight of in the
late period, and we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the Vendidad that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Spenta Mainyu
is identified with Ahura Mazda himself, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Angra Mainyu
stands in direct antagonism to God. The Parsi scholars who were ever in
search for some new arguments to remove the so-called weak point of their
<span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> eagerly embraced this new explanation, which, they thought, saved the
Gathas at least from the stain of dualism. If the Vendidad and other later
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> introduced it in the Zoroastrian theology, it was a decided fall, they
claimed, from the original pure monotheism. The prophet himself never
taught dualism, they argued, and it is unfair to ascribe that doctrine to him,
for which the enlightened youth had to blush before modern criticism!

CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES ATTACK ZOROASTRIANISM
Indifference on the part of the Parsi youth arouses the proselytizing zeal
of the Christian missionaries. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that they could easily turn the
apathy of the newly educated Parsi youth for his own religion to interest in
the <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> of Jesus, if they could convince him of the superiority of

Christianity over his national creed. The impressionable youth once secured,
they imagined, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prove a valuable asset in bringing over his enlightened
coreligionists to the Christian fold. Christianity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> easily spread
downwards among the masses, they thought, if only they could capture the
upper educated classes. The missionaries felt that this handful of the
progressive people, who approached nearest to the Western <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in their
modes of living, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ultimately be easily won over to their faith. With this
<span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> in <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> some of them began to study the Zoroastrian scriptures first
hand, during the latter part of the first half of the last century. They picked
out what seemed to them to be vulnerable points in the Zoroastrian faith,
and exposed them to the ridicule of the Parsi youth newly tinged with
Western ideas. The community was alarmed at this aggression, the more so
when a couple of converts were actually made to Christianity from this class.
Salient features of Zoroastrianism assailed by the missionaries. The
religion of Zoroaster, the controversialists alleged, abounded in absurdities
and incongruities. It was based on the idolatry of nature. The Parsi scholars
repudiated the accusation with indignation, and said that in their reverence
for the elements of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> they never worshipped fire, sun, and such other
elements, but venerated the angels presiding over these noble productions of
God, holding them to be his purest symbols.1 1. A Parsi Priest, Tâlim-i
Zurtoosht, p. 15, Bombay, 1840; Aspandiarji, Hâdie Gum Râhân (Eng. version),
p. 44, Bombay, 1841. [492]An erroneous rendering of Vd. 19. 9 had led
Anquetil du Perron, the first translator of the Avestan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> into a European
tongue, to depict Boundless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> as the first principle of the Universe.2 This
interpretation was <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as an unequivocal testimony of the Zoroastrian
scriptures to corroborate the statement of the Greek and Armenian writers
who had alleged that both Ohrmazd and Ahriman had sprung from Time.
Anquetil's mistake was repeated in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the European writers for a
considerable time, until it was finally corrected by the unanimous verdict of
the Iranian scholars of the West during the latter half of the last century.
When the Zoroastrian scriptures were adversely criticized by the
missionaries on the ground that the doctrine of Boundless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> at the apex
of existence proved the derivative and secondary character of Ormazd,3 the
Parsi priests repudiated the charge and vigorously maintained that the
concept simply designated eternity and nothing more. Far from being

Ormazd's superior, Boundless Time, they affirmed was his creation. 2. ZendAvesta, vol. 1, p. 414; vol. 2, p. 592, Paris 1771.
3. Wilson, The Parsi Religion, p. 134, Bombay, 1843. More heated was the
controversy that hinged <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the alleged belief of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival spirits. We have
already seen 'how dualism has been the main question of inveterate
controversies,; we shall here only advert to it in passing When the missionaries derisively <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Parsis the worshippers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> gods, which certainly
they never were, they at once vehemently denied the charge and hastened to
repudiate it by denying downright an objective existence to Ahriman. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> Spirit, they argued, is not an entity, but merely the symbolic

nothing more than the lusts and passions of man.4
4. A Parsi Priest, Tâlim-i Zurtoosht, p. 62-64, 83, 84; Aspandiarji, Hâdie Gum
Râhân (Eng. version); p. 35-37, 73, 74. Parsi apologists meet the charges of
their opponents by resorting to allegorical explanations. This attempt at
giving allegorical interpretations of the scriptures was carried still further.
Tradition had always seen some geographical data in the first [493]chapter
of the Vendidad, and modern scholarship had accepted that view; but in
their polemics with the missionaries the Parsi scholars explained the opening
of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> by asserting that the act of Ohrmazd in creating Iran Vej, the
first region of the world, was to be interpreted as a mere figurative expression
for religious faith, and Ahriman's counter <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of winter was emblematic
of infidelity. Similarly, the various places said to have been created by
Ohrmazd indicated man's body, and the obnoxious creatures of Ahriman
signified man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> passions.5 Another instance of the same <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
interpretation may be cited. Druj Nasu, or the Demon of Defilement is
spoken of in the Vendidad as taking possession of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has touched
the corpse of a dog or a man,6 and a minute description is given as to how
the demon is successively driven out from the top of the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of the defiled
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> to the tips of his toes, as the ablution ceremony is being performed.
This rite was criticized as being revolting to common sense.7 Instead of

defending it on hygienic principles, the learned controversialists again
expatiated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the mystic significance of the text, and alleged that the

represented his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> nature, while the successive expulsion of the fiend from
one part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the other, until finally eradicated, meant the gradual
improvement of a man's character.8 Zoroastrianism teaches that the <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> of
burying corpses is inexpiable.9 The pulling down of the dakhmas, wherein lie
interred the dead bodies of such men, is a means of the expiation of one's
sins in thought, word, and deed; and is equivalent to the recital of a Patit.10
Responding to a criticism on this passage, recourse was again <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to
declare it as couched in mysterious language. It was curiously explained to
mean that the dakhma referred to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of man, the corpse stood for his

seizing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the weak points of the Christian scriptures and turning them
into ridicule, just as we have seen, the author of the Shikand Gumanik Vijar
did in the Pahlavi period. Theological questions were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> discussed with

their own religion began to be prosecuted by the Parsi priests with greater
avidity than before.

Zoroastrianism. The compromises and concessions made on the part of the
early Parsi settlers in India were needed to conciliate the prejudices of the
Hindu rulers. The Parsis were a handful of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> living in the midst of the
teeming millions of India, and even the twelve centuries of their residence in
this country have failed to merge them in the ocean of Indian humanity. This
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> is largely due to their intensely communal spirit, fostered by the dread of
being assimilated into greater communities, and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> losing their
individuality. But the average Parsi did not fail to borrow many superstitious
customs and habits from the Hindus as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as from the Mohammedans during the later period. The Hindu augur and the Moslem diviner became
important factors in the family <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Parsis.

cast the horoscope of the new-born Zoroastrian child; they foretold the
future, administered amulets to heal every sickness and disease in the family,
prescribed charms to ward off the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> eye, exorcised demoniacal influences
from persons possessed by the powers of darkness, and, in many ways,
proved indispensable auxiliaries to a Parsi from birth to death. The mediation
of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or of a Mullah was often rated <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than that of a Mobad,,
and a Sanskrit mantra or an Arabic kalma was regarded more efficacious for
the purchase of heavenly boons than an Avestan manthra. The Zoroastrian
priest ruled in the fire-temple, but the non-Zoroastrian priest had a powerful
sway over the hearts of the Parsi populace. With rich offerings did the
faithful repair to the tombs of Moslem saints and to Hindu shrines. They laid
their <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> all altars and turned to strange <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> in their extremities. The
grandeur of the Mazdayasnian teachings had faded, and Zoroaster had partly
ceased to be a living force in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the community. [496]Many
alien customs had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> worked their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into Zoroastrianism. These were

hard facts for the orthodox to admit but they were facts all the same. With
the vigour of youth and with unquenchable zeal the reformers of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
undertook to liberate the community from the thraldom of superimposed
non-Zoroastrian customs, and to wean it from superstitions.
The reformers protested against reciting their prayers parrot-wise in an
unintelligible language. The Avesta language had <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> since fallen into
disuse. It was not a living language. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the belief in its being of celestial
origin, the tongue in which Ohrmazd addressed his heavenly court, and even
that in which Ahriman harangued his ribald crew, had preserved it as the
only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> vehicle for conveying prayers. The reformers now argued that it
was meaningless to mumble an unintelligible gibberish which neither the
priest himself nor the layman understood. Ejaculations and genuflexions were
of no avail, when they recited their prayers in a dead language. No amount
of such formulas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> affect the character of the devotees and ennoble their
thoughts. A prayer that had no subjective value was no prayer. It failed to
awaken any ethical fervour, for a truly devout prayer should spur the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> life. This was not possible so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the priest
perfunctorily droned prayers, not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of which was understood. The
orthodox vehemently retorted that the Avestan language Was divine, and as
such it possessed inherent magical efficacy. Miraculously composed as these
Avestan prayers were, they had indescribable objective value, it was claimed,
quite independent of the motive of one who recited them. The mere
utterance of the sacred texts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing in the least what they meant,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> produce marvellous effect. The ultra-orthodox viewed the situation
with pious dread and entertained serious apprehension that, if once the
community permitted the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of Gujarati or English compositions for daily
prayers, nothing short of a revolutionary change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> come, and with the
lapse of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be supplanted by prayer-books
composed in the modern vernaculars. The reformers pointed out that there
already existed some monajat prayers composed in Persian by some of the
learned Dasturs even in their own lifetime, which the orthodox were using
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any scruple at the end of their daily Avestan prayers. [497]A fierce
controversy raged around this question, with the result that the orthodox
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on praying in their own way, and the reformers, neither having <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in
the recital of their prayers in an unintelligible language nor having a proper

substitute to satisfy their demand, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> prayers of any kind. And the
situation remains, in large measure, unchanged up to this very day.
The Avesta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> metamorphosed into an ungrammatical jargon. The
reformers further said that the Avestan <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> were recited with the most
incorrect pronunciations. In vindication of their statement they quoted
passages from the original <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> and put by their side the corrupt formulas in
vogue in the community. An example of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> may not be out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
here, and we shall insert the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> of Ahunavar, the most important
Zoroastrian formula, first in its correct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and then in the corrupt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
which obtains among a considerable portion of the community up to this
hour. The original formula is as follows :
yathâ ahu vairyo athâ ratush ashât chit hachâ
vangheush dazdâ manangho shyaothananâm angheush Mazdâi
khshathremchâ ahurâi â yim dregubyo dadat vâstârem.
The corrupt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the same:
athâu veryo thâre tose sâde chide châvanghoise dezdâ manengho sotthenanâm anghyos
Mazdâe khosetharamchâe orâe âiyem daregobyo daredar vâstârem.
This, however, did not trouble the orthodox, for they complacently
remarked that as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as they had implicit <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in what they recited, and
recited it whole-heartedly, it mattered very little <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> they <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> correct
pronunciation or not. Ohrmazd looked to their hearts, and not to their <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span>
of grammar and orthography. So <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as their motives were good, their
prayers were acceptable to the Heavenly Father. The redeeming feature of
this entire controversy has been a growing tendency in the community to
avail itself of the help of the philologist, who has <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> nearer home to
them the correct and carefully edited version of their sacred scriptures, and
they have consequently begun to recite their daily prayers from books that
have based their <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> on the standard and authorized version of the liturgy.
[498] Too much ritualism, protested the reformer. The mechanical
handling of the ritual, which was as much unintelligible in its real purport to
the priest who performed it as it was to the layman who ordered it, failed to
satisfy the new school. The orthodox maintained that although the priestly

authorities themselves had lost the key of the mysteries of the ceremonies
and were unable to understand their meaning, nevertheless untold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> accrued to those who devoutly ordered such ceremonies for their own merit.
They entertained a pious hope that the lost key <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> be
recovered, and the hidden secrets <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the day. The
reformers urged that a vast structure of formalism and ritual had replaced the
edifice of the simple faith, and religion had simply turned into ritualism.
They dwelt especially on the subjective value of the ritual, and argued that
however elaborate and expensive the ceremony might be, it was of no value
if it failed to symbolize a moral <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> for the faithful who ordered it.
Ceremonial observances, they complained, were given greater importance
than moral observance. Righteousness was identified with rituals. They were
only a clothing of religion, but the ethical substance of religion was of
greater importance than the clothing itself. Religion, they urged, does not
consist in laying up merit by ceremonials. The orthodox retorted that the
ritual as such had an intrinsic value and inherent merit, and the more such
rites were performed, the greater was the merit assured to the faithful. The
new school said that these ceremonials may perhaps serve as a means of
conveying ethical ideas to a backward people, but the Parsis were not a
backward people. Hence they did not need them. Righteousness did not
depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> such ceremonial observances, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the purity of man's
inner life. Besides, the ceremonials became an economic drain on the slender
resources of the credulous poor, who incurred heavy debts for their
performance, which was displeasing in the sight of Ohrmazd. The orthodox
declared these statements an Ahrimanian onslaught <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Mazdayasnian
rites.
The progressives denounced the intercessory prayers for the dead. The
philological researches had for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the notice of the
Parsis the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> of the sharp distinction between man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and his Farohar.
From what has been stated in the earlier pages, it can be clearly seen how
this essential [499]difference was lost sight of, as early as during the later
Pahlavi period. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the Farohar were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to be one and the same
by the Zoroastrians before the philologist pointed out the error. Priest and
layman, the learned and the illiterate alike, believed implicitly that the souls
of the dead profited by the ceremonials performed in their honour by their

relatives in this world. The Avestan and Pahlavi passages, which <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the
coming of the Farohars to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at the period of the Fravar-digan festival,
seeking invocation and sacrifice, were understood by the entire Community
as indubitably referring to the coming of the souls of the dead.1 1. K. M.

the supplications offered by the living procured either a remission of the sins
committed by the deceased in this world, or else a specific merit for the

ceremonials to help the struggling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in either making its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> out of hell,

penitential prayers were recited to secure a better lot for the souls of the
dead, and the performance of these periodical rites was most zealously
observed. Rich viands were consecrated in the name of the deceased.
Whatever <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> or drink the departed ones had best liked in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> were

were offered them to assuage the hunger and thirst on their return journey,
while money in copper and silver was dedicated to them to meet their
travelling expenses. The recital of the Patit, or expiatory prayer, forms an important part of the ceremonies performed in honour of the dead. The
relatives and friends of the deceased still engage a priest to recite it, and do
the same themselves for the expiation and welfare of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when it is

keep up this observance daily for at least a month, or throughout the first
year, or in many cases for a still longer period. [500]The reformers <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> up
the question and said that Zoroastrian-ism enjoined that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the
abode of weal or woe according to his deserts, and that no amount of
ceremonials performed by the living could either mitigate his sufferings or
improve his condition in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. His sins could not be atoned for
by elaborate rituals performed in his name, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> he be one whit the
happier for them. It is true, they further said, that according to the scriptures,
the benefit of the ceremonials performed for the dead accrues to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

but from the period of the dawn of the fourth day, when justice is
administered to the soul, and it is awarded its special place, the rituals do not
affect its position. Any ceremonies performed after this day, that is, on the
monthly and yearly anniversaries or on any other occasions, are mainly for
the Farohar of the dead man, and not for his soul. In fact, it was claimed,
these rites are more for the interest of the living than for the imagined
interest of the dead. Zoroastrianism, they said, never stood for any <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
vicarious salvation, for the question of salvation or damnation rested on the
individual's own deeds. Neither <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> the expiatory prayers recited by the

they contended, cannot be purchased at a price, and <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> cannot be expiated

It was destroying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the prophet's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religion to
entertain such degrading ideas of vicarious expiation which had been
fastened on Zoroastrianism. These scathing criticisms seriously wounded the
religious susceptibilities of the orthodox, who became unsparing in the vehement denunciation of the reformers, charging them as reactionaries with
carrying the religious barque to ruin. They branded the attempts of the
reformers as blasphemous and as an irreverent prying into the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of

and invectives, ridicule and obloquy, became rampant over these and several
other controversial questions.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the disputants saved the community from being split
into sects. The reformers were termed the [501]Parsi Protestants and were
charged with thinking in terms of Christianity. They were said to be fired by
the sole ambitition of being original, and of setting at naught the
achievements of their elders for the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years. The reformers
replied that they were simply looking to antiquity for models for their
conduct and were profiting solely by the vast experience of the past. But at
the same time, they rejoined, the orthodox should remember that the
ancients had tackled the religious and ceremonial questions that arose in
their own <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> according to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that had prevailed in the past. Those of
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> had not done the thinking for all times to come, with injunctions to
the future generations to act in strict accordance with them. They alone had

not the monopoly to think, and had not given the final mandate to acquiesce
in all that they had believed. Besides, a return to the past could not being
unalloyed happiness to the Parsis in the present times. The community, it
was urged, cannot afford to transplant itself back to the age of the Vendidad.
There was no <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> sticking to outworn forms and seeking to give them a new
life. It was futile to attempt to support delusions, and the orthodox, they
said, should not throw all possible shackles in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of progress by
hampering and paralyzing the well-meant efforts of the new school. Such, in
brief form, is the story of the opening of the conflict between conservative
and <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> among the Parsis in India, which rent the community into
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sections. The rival parties, however, did not make any formal division
between themselves. The reformers did not. venture to contemplate so
complete a break with the orthodox as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> culminate in the establishment
of a reformed Church. The orthodox could not excommunicate the
reformers even if they would. The orthodox had to content themselves with
condemning the reformers, and the reformers by satrizing the orthodox.
Even to-day the main disputes over some of these vital problems remain
much the same as they were nine decades ago, and the battle goes on, still to
be won.

Parsi theosophists. In the early eighties of the last century the Parsi
members of the Theosophical <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> entered the arena of religious
controversy and gave new zest to it. They became a potent factor in shaping
the religious beliefs of a section of the [503]community through their active
propaganda. Hitherto ritual observances, theological dogmas, and
ecclesiastical usages had occupied a most conspicuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the religious
controversies. The Parsi theosophists introduced metaphysical themes such
as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Being, a personal or an impersonal God, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> or
emanation, reincarnation, and such like for discussion. This is significant as
an indication of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> phase in religious polemics. They showed a strong
tendency towards mysticism in religion. They did not flee from the sight and
sound of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and withdrew themselves to the fastness of the jungle, nor did
they mortify their flesh, but their code of ethics comprised the ascetic
virtues, tempered by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the age.
Custodians of the only key to Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster and his disciples,
the theosophical interpreters said, wrote in a mystic language which
conveyed a double meaning. The exoteric, or surface meaning, was intended
for the vulgar, and the esoteric, or inner meaning, was designed only for the
initiates. The adepts of various periods were the ones who possessed the
mysterious key to the chamber of hidden truths. The last of such Parsi adept
was Azar Kaivan, who died at Patna in 1614. With his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> this key was
lost. Occult science alone, it was asserted, could explain and vindicate the

allegorical teachings of Zoroaster. Providence had <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> the founders of
the Theosophical <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">Society</span> with the possession of a master-key that opened
the secret chambers of the hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all religions. The
Zoroastrian theosophists applied this key to Zoroastrianism to unravel the
mysteries of its exoteric teachings. They aimed at an adjustment of the
fundamental Zoroastrian concept according to the standard philosophy of
their society, which was an eclectic system drawing its materials mostly from
Hinduism and Buddhism.
The theosophists summarily rejected the method of the philologist
adopted in interpreting the sacred texts. In their zeal for discovering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
truths buried under the seemingly simple texts, but alleged to be pregnant
with deep meaning, these esoterics often invested legends and myths with a
symbolic significance, and included much in the sphere of serious literature
that could be relegated to the realm of poetry. They alleged that the
philologists, being bound by the fetters of literalism in the interpretation of
the sacred texts, generally <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a statement at its <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> value and adhered to
the surface meaning. The theosophists [504]chose to lean <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
miraculous and mysterious, rather than to follow the recognized canons of
the method of reasoning. Consequently, the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of proportion, critical
acumen, the historical sense, accurate thinking, and such preliminary
requisites of modern scholarship became conspicuous by. their absence in
most of their interpretations. Flashes of vague <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> came to be regarded
as inspiration, and visions as verities. <span class="t28 hoverable">Passage</span> after <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> in the Zoroastrian
scriptures was explained to signify what it did not mean in the original. The
following may be adduced as a specimen: The pastoral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span>
Iran had found a faithful sentinel in the dog, and that animal, as shown by
the Avesta, occupied an exalted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> among the Iranians from the earliest
ages; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chapters of the Vendidad in <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> were devoted to this
indispensable companion of the household, All scholars in accord with the
traditional interpretation have naturally <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> these passages as the
fragments of an old Iranian canine literature. But the theosophists branded
this explanation as absurd, and discerned in the chapters an allegorical
description of conscience and its workings. Space here precludes the citation
of other examples of this kind. When the linguists challenged such
interpretation of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> texts, they were informed that their inability to

reconcile themselves to the new esoteric explanations was due to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> of
not having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> sufficiently developed their <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> faculties. They were
dubbed 'mere philologists,' 'dry-as-dust' grammarians. Highly pungent
bitterness was marked in the controversy carried on between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parties.
The theosophists in this controversy denounced the philologists, and the
philologists denounced the theosophists.
Parsi theosophists as champions of the cause of orthodoxy. The advocacy
on the part of the theosophists of the revival of the past, and their seeing in
such a revival the sole panacea of communal ills, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> real or imaginary,
their readiness to allege religious sanction for the time-hallowed customs,
matched with their zeal for ritual, and their eagerness to vindicate the sacred
ceremonies by giving strained allegorical interpretations to explain them,
won for them the applause of the orthodox ? party, who cast in their lot with
them. Inasmuch as the Parsi, theosophists declared that they were working to
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the youth of the community from the, trough of materialism, and
[505]endeavoring to defend Zoroastrianism against innovations of the
reformers, they were regarded as the pillars of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and the guardians of the
edifice of ceremonialism.
Avestan prayers, however unintelligible, were declared the most
efficacious owing to their occult significance. We have already seen the
arguments advanced by the reformers against addressing to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> prayers in a
language unintelligible to the suppliant, and we have noted the discussion
that followed. We now need only notice the part that the theosophists <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span>
in the controversy. The syllables composed in the Avestan texts, they
averred, were so mysteriously adjusted to each other in the prayers, that they
produced vibrations on the ethereal plane, when pronounced. The potency
of such rhythmical sound was so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> that, like every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that
flashed out with strong occult force and sent forth a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> "elemental," it
created forms in the ethereal world, attracted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> "elementals," and
repelled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> ones. Every single sentence conveyed an occult meaning, and
the prayers composed in the celestial tongue of the prophet and other seers
had an unspeakable efficacy conducing to the welfare of the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
concerned, but their renderings into any modern vernacular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> make
them totally ineffectual as prayers.

Zoroastrianism in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of theosophy. These followers of an eclectic
philosophy, and interpreters of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> scriptures through a claimed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of occult and hidden meanings, applied the theosophic principles
of explanation to the teachings of Zoroaster, and adapted them to the
Zoroastrian theology. Such an interpretation, however, led them to credit
the religion of Zoroaster with ideas that in no period of its religious history
were ever included in its sphere. When these theosophic interpreters of
Zoroastrianism were reminded that the thoughts they claimed to read in the
canonical Zoroastrian <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> were not there, they argued with a doubtful
historical perspective that if they did not meet them in the plain words, in
the authentic texts, it was because the twenty-one Nasks of the prophet had
not been preserved. If the bulk of the Zoroastrian canon had not been
irrevocably lost, they should undoubtedly have found such doctrines to be
indissolubly associated with the cardinal <span class="t9 t12 t13 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the Zoroastrian faith. Every
Iranian student knows that the historical sources and records of the teachings
of the prophet that were in vogue at any particular [506]period of
Zoroastrian history have not perished altogether Something of every period,
<span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the Gathic, Avestan, Pahlavi, or the later periods, has fortunately
survived the vandalism of the conquering hordes and the ravages of time,
and consequently has come down to the present day. For instance, in the
controversy regarding the rebirth theory, to which we shall advert below,
the theosophic interpreters, having recourse to similar arguments, stated that
we should have found the theory of transmigration of souls taught in the
Zoroastrian works, if these had reached us intact. It might be pointed out,
however, that the fragmentary <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of all periods of Zoroastrian history
have come down to us; they contain the authentic teachings on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> after
death, but they all persistently and systematically <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of only one bodily
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the earth, and never once suggest the theory of rebirth.
Zrvan Akarana as an impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the theosophic light. The
theosophists attempted a readjustment of the Zoroastrian doctrine of a
personal God, or rather in accordance with their theory of an impersonal
God. Personality, they alleged implied limitation and was a characteristic of
the finite. A personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> meant that the godhead was a limited God, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> an incomplete God. In Zrvan Akarana, or Boundless Time, the

Parsi theosophists saw this impersonal neuter being of whom nothing could
be predicated. This supposititious being was the rootless root from which
issued Ohrmazd. Ahriman was but Ohrmazd's manifested shadow. Zrvan
Akarana, the primeval impersonal principle, according to their interpretation,
was like a central <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> from which all <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> had emanated. The <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
was only a vital spark, and his final resting-place was in it. Passionately
loving the light, the moth finally immolated itself in the flame; in like
manner the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> had to throw off the illusory shackles of personality
and be merged in the Universal, the One. This doctrine is certainly not
Zoroastrian, because through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> history of the religion individuality
is not an illusion. It is ever a stern fact. Personality is not an imperfection, but
it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> expression of life, that ultimately strives for the divine. Not
the losing of individuality and the loss of the personal self, and not the
weakening of personality, but the gaining and strengthening of it, is the
Zoroastrian ideal. This has been the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> taught by Zoroastrianism in the
striving [507] for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aims comprehensible to mankind from the
remotest antiquity. Zrvan was extolled above Ohrmazd, who was ranked by
them as a mere manifestation of Time. The one was elevated by debasing the
other. The personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> who could be loved and feared, who responded to

monistic principle that might answer the stern canons of cold intellectualism,
but which evaporated into an unthinkable abstraction and mercilessly <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> its
hapless votaries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of solace or hope. Affection, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and
devotion, however, can centre about some personality only. We <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the
authoritative teachings of the Zoroastrian Church that Ohrmazd knows no
peer, and he always sits supreme at the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> hierarchy. These
modern votaries of Zrvan were, however, not to be confounded with the
Zarvanite sect of old, which looked to Zrvan Akarana as a personality as
much defined as Ohrmazd. We have already seen that, in postulating
impersonated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> as the originator of Ohrmazd and Ahriman, the sect
aimed at supplanting Zoroastrian dualism by monotheism, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save
their religion from the so-called stigma of dualism. Not so the theosophists,
who grafted this new feature on the pure teachings of Zoroaster. They did
not personify Time, but reckoned this abstract principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
than Ohrmazd himself, because, in common with all mystic schools, they
held the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of an impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> category of philosophical

thought.
Zoroastrianism declared by the thesophic claim to be incomplete <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
the doctrine of transmigration of souls. From first to last Zoroastrianism,
like Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, shows no sign of this
theory of rebirth. But this dogma occupied a pre-eminent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> among the

their doctrines. To teach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to attain liberation from the bondage of

CONCLUSION
And now we have reached the completion of our study down to the present
day. We have traced the gradual development of the religion of Zarathushtra
during the various periods of its history.

Zarathushtra's immortal triad of 'good thoughts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> words, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

thoughts, illumined the minds, and warmed the hearts of the countless
numbers of his followers. Throughout its history Zoroastrianism has seen its
bright and dark days, accompanied by the rise and fall of the political <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

of its adherents. During these ages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and mighty kings, in whom was

no more. But the one personality in whom was sanctified the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> power,

periods of the nation's history and will ever continue to rule so in the ages to
come. Zarathushtra, the chosen of Ahura Mazda, does not belong to any
single period and particular people, but to all ages and to all peoples. He is
unchanging. His religion it was that inspired the Iranian nation with the
loftiest of ideals when Iran was at the zenith of her power. His ever
optimistic teachings and the ever cheerful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of his sublime doctrines
saved its remnants from falling into the slough of pessimism and gloom,
thirteen centuries ago, when the Zoroastrian community stood appalled by
the national catastrophe that sounded the death-knell of their empire. With
the downfall of the empire the hope of regaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> had disappeared
forever. They could never see visions of its restoration. History has recorded
this one and unique pathetic instance of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> nation [510]of millions being
reduced to a small community of a little over a hundred <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> souls all
told, still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> to its <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> faith. Everything that was nearest and dearest to
them in the fatherland was gone. Zarathushtra remained their only hope, and
with his religion as the only cherished heritage, the Parsi exiles sought an
asylum in Iran. Thirteen centuries have dragged their weary course since
they first landed on this the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of their hope and began their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> anew.
Rulers of nations they have not become, but they have proved themselves to
be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> bearers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> name and fame of their illustrious forebears.
The pages of their national history are still thrilling with the noble deeds of
the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Iranians, and their dutiful descendants have faithfully reflected
their past national <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> in the mirror of their small community. Zoroastrian
virtues have made the modern Parsis great. The community has secured a
pioneer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the social, intellectual, and industrial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the teeming
millions of India. They have amassed vast fortunes and have given away
equally vast sums for philanthropic purposes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> distinction of caste,
color, or creed. An <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> member among the Parsis to-day is a better
cared-for unit than one in any society. The Parsis yearly contribute for his
relief at a rate which no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> does for its <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> member.
The virtue of charity has been built into the very communal fibre, and is
woven into the tissues of every individual's being. A religion that produces

such results in the practical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a community <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> deserves the epithet
'excellent,' which the Mazda-worshipping religion of Zarathushtra is given
in the Confession of Faith. With sublime confidence Zarathushtra foretold to

weathered the heaviest of storms and survived them; and a religion which
