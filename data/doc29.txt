The search was a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and heavy work, for there
were thousands of fragments to be examined, and
these were so small, and contained so little of the text,
that it was extremely difficult to ascertain their
meaning. The search, however, proved successful.
A fragment of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> copy of the Deluge was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span>
