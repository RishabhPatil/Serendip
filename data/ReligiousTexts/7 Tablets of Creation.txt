PERHAPS
no section of Babylonian literature has been
more generally studied than the legends which record
the Creation of the world. On the publication of
the late Mr. George Smith's work, " T h e Chaldean
Account of Genesis," which appeared some twentyseven years ago, it was recognized that there was
in the Babylonian account of the Creation, as it
existed in the seventh century before Christ, much
which invited comparison with the corresponding
narrative in the Booli of Genesis. It is true that the
Babylonian legends which had been recovered and
were first published by him were very fragmentary,
and that the exact number and order of the Tablets,
or sections, of which they were composed were quite
uncertain ; and that, although they recorded the
creation of the heavens and of the heavenly bodies,
they contained no direct account of the creation of
man. In spite of this, however, their resemblance
to the Hebrew narrative was unmistakable, and in
consequence they at once appealed to a far larger
circle of students than would otherwise have been
the case.
After the appearance of Mr. Smith's worli, other
scholars produced translations of the fragments which

.---p--p-

~

he had published, and the names of Oppert, Schrader,
and Sayce will always be associated with those who
were the first to devote themselves to the interpretation of the Creation Legends.
Moreover,
new fragments of the legends have from time to
time been acquired by the Trustees of the British
Museum, and of these the most important is the
fine text of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation
Series, containing the account of the fight between
the god Marduk and the dragon Tiamat, which
was published in 1887 by Dr. Wallis Budge, and
translated by Professor Sayce in the same year.
Professor Sayce's translation of the Creation Legends
marked a distinct advance upon those of his predecessors, and it was the most complete, inasmuch
as he was enabled to make use of the new tablet
which restored so much of the central portion of the
story. In the year 1890, in his important worlc
Die KosmoLogie der BabyZonier, Professor Jensen of
Marburg gave a translation of the legends together
with a transliteration and commentary ; in 1895
Professor Zimmern of Leipzig translated all the
fragments then known, and a year later Professor
Delitzsch of Berlin also published a rendering.
Finally, two years ago, Professor Jensen issued a new
and revised translation of the Creation Legends in the
opening pages of the iirst part of his worlc Mythen
und Epen, the second part of which, containing his
notes and commentary, appeared some months ago.

I n the course of the year ~ g o o ,the writer was
entrusted with the task of co1;ying the texts of a number
of Babylonian and Assyrian legends for publication
in the series of CzcnezJvrm T e x t s f r o m Ua(iyLoniarc
Tablets, etc., in the B r i t i s h M z ~ s e z ~ ? and,
n , among the
documents selected for issue, were those relating
to the Creation of the world. Several of the texts
of the Creation Legends, which had been used by
previous translators, had never been published, and
one tablet, which Mr. George Smith had co~lsultecl
in 1876, had not been identified by subsequent
worlters. During my work I was so fortunate as to
recogliize this tablet, and was e~lableclto 111alte copies
of all the texts, not only of those which were previously
known, but also of a number of new duplicates and
fragments which I had meanwhile identified. These
copies appeared in C z ~ n e ( f o w ~ zT e x t s , Part X I I I
( ~ g o r ) ,Plates 1-41. T h e most interesting of the
new fragments there published was a tablet which
restored a missing portion of the text of the Second
Tablet of the Creation Series, and of this, on account
of its interest, I gave a translatioll in a note to the
plate on which the text appeared. It was not lily
intention at that time to publish anything further
upon the subject of the Creation Legends.
\;\'hile I was engaged, ho\+-ever, in searching for
fragments of other Babylonian legends for publication
officially, it was 111y good fortune to come across
a fine cl~~plicatc
of the Second Tablet of the Cre.rl t'loll

Series. A further prolonged search was rewarded
by the finding of other fragments of the poem, and
a study of these showed me that the earlier portions
of the text of the Creation Story, as already known,
could be considerably augmented. Among them,
moreover, was a fragment of the poem which refers
to the Creation of Man ; this fragment is extremely
important, for in addition to its valuable contents it
also settles the disputed question as to the number of
Tablets, or sections, of which the Creation Series was
composed. I n view of the additional il~formationas
to the form and contents of the poem which this new
material afforded, it was clearly necessary that a new
translation of the Creation Legends should be made,
and this I undertook forthwith.
The new fragments of the poem which I had
identified up to the summer of last year are inscribed
upon tablets of the Neo- Babylonia11 period. At
the conclusion of the examination of tablets of this
class, I lithographed the newly identified texts in
a series of plates which are published in the second
volume of the present work. These plates were
already printed off, when, at the beginning of the
present year, after my return from Assyria, I identified
a fresh group of fragments of the poem inscribed,
not upon Neo-Babylonian, but upon Assyrian tablets.
At that time I was engaged on making a detailed
catalogue, or hand-list, of the smaller fragments in
the various collections of Assyrian tablets from

Kuyunjili, and, as a result of previous study of the
legends themselves and of the Assyrian commentaries
to the Seventh Tablet of the series, I was enabled
to identify ten new fragments of the poem which are
inscribed up011 tablets from the library of Ashurbani-pal at Nineveh. In order to avoid upsetting the
arrangement of the plates in Vol. 11, the texts of
the new Assyrian fragments are published by means
of outline bloclis in Appendices I and I1 to the
present volume.
Those who have studied the publishecl texts of the
Creation Series will remerllber that the material used
by previous translators of the legends has consisted
of some twenty-one tablets ;ind fragments inscribed
with .portions of the poem. T h e number of new
tablets and fragments belonging to the Creation Series
which are here used and tra~lslatecl for the first time
reaches the total of thirty-four, but, as I have joined
up six of these to other similar fragments, this total
has been reduced to twenty-eight. Thus, in place
of the twenty-one tablets previously linown, fortynine separate tablets and fragments have now been
identified as containing portio~ls of the text of the
Creation Series.
T h e new information, furnished by the recently
discovered material reglrding the Story of Creation,
may here be briefly summarized.
Hitherto our
knowledge of the contents of Tablets I and I1 of
the series has been very fragmentary.
After the

PREFACE.

narrative of the creation of the great gods in the
opening lines of the poem, and a fragmentary
reference to the .first symptoms of revolt exhibited
by the primeval monsters, Apsii and Tiamat, and
Mummu, the minister of Apsu, there occurred a great
gap in the text, and the story began again with the
account of how Tiamat prepared to wage war against
the gods. ApsE and Mummu have a t this point
entirely disappeared from the narrative, and the ally
of Tiamat is the god Kingu, whom she appoints to
command her forces. What followed the creation of
the great gods, what was the cause of the revolt, what
was the fate of Apsu and Mummu, and what were the
events which led up to Tiamat's preparations for
battle, are questions that have hitherto remained
unanswered. W e now know that the accoutit of the
creation of the gods was no fuller than that which
has come down to us from Damascius. After the
birth of Lakhmu and Lakhamu, Anshar and Kishar,
Anu, Re1 (i.e., Enlil, or Illil), and E a (Nudimmud),
the text does not proceed to narrate in detail the
coming forth of the lesser deities, but plunges at once
into the story of the revolt of the primeval forces of
chaos. W e now know also that it was Apsii, and not
Tiamat, who began the revolt against the gods; and
that, according to the poem, his enmity was aroused,
not by the creation of light as has been previously
suggested, but by the disturbance of his rest in
consequence of the new " w a y " of the gods, which
tended to produce order in place of chaos.

PREFACE.

XVII

One of the most striking facts which the new
fragments furnish with regard to the contents of the
legends is the prominent part played by the god E a
in the earlier episodes of the story. After Apse and
Mummu had repaired to Tiamat and had hatched with
her their t lot against the gods, it was the god Ea,
who, abounding in all wisdom, detected their plan and
frustrated it. T h e details of Ea's action are still
a matter of uncertainty, but, as I have shown in the
Introduction, it is clear that A p s i and Mummu were
overthrown, and that their conqueror was Ea. Moreover, it was only after their downfall, and in order
to avenge them, that Tiamat began her preparations
for battle. She was encouraged in her determination
by the god Icingu, and it was in consequence of the
assistance he then gave her that she afterwards
appointed him leader of her host.
Another point which is explained by the new
fragments concerns the repetitions in Tablets I, 11,
and 111 of the lines containing the account of Tiamat's
preparations for battle. T h e lines describing this
episode are given no less than four times : in Tablet I,
in Tablet 11, and twice in Tablet 111. W e now
know that the first description of Tiamat's preparations
occurs after the account of her determination to avenge
her former allies ; and in the Second Tablet the lines
are put into the mouth of E a , who continues to play
a prominent part in the narrative, and carries the
tidings to Anshar. How Anshar repeated the lines
B

XVIII

PREFACE.

to Gaga, his messenger, and how Gaga delivered the
message to Lakhmu and Lalthamu, is already well
known.
Perhaps the most striking of all the new fragments
of the poem here published is that which contains the
opening and closing lines of the Sixth Tablet, and, at
last, furnishes us with a portion of the text describing
the Creation of Man. W e now linow that, as in the
Hebrew narrative, the culminating act of Creation was
the malting of man. Marclult is here represented as
declaring to E a that he will create man from his ow11
blood, and from bone which he will form ; it is important to note that the Assyrian word here used for
"bone," isSimtu, which has not hitherto been known,
corresponds to the Hebrew word 'e;em, "bone," which
occurs in G,en. ii, 2 3 , in connection with the account
of the creation of woman. The text thus furnishes
another point of resemblance between the Babylonian
and the Hebrew stories of Creation. T h e new
fragment also corroborates in a remarkable degree
the account given by Berossus of the Babylonian
version of the creation of man. According to the
writer's rendering of the passage, Marduk declares
that he will use his own blood in creating mankind,
and this agrees with the statement of Berossus, that
Bd directed one of the gods to cut off his (i.e. Bel's)
head, and to form manltind from his blood mixed with
earth. This subject is discussed at length and in detail
in the Introduction, as well as a number of new points

PREFACE.

XIX

of resemblance between the Babylonian and the
Hebrew accounts of the Creation which are furnished
by other recently identified fragments of the poem.
With regard to the extent and contents of the
Creation Series, we now know that the Tablets of
which the series was colnposed are seven in number ;
and we also possess the missing context or framework of the Seventh Tablet, which contains addresses
to Marduk under his fifty titles of honour. From
this we learn that, when the work of Creation was
ended, the gods gathered together once more in
Upshukkinakku, their council - chamber ; here they
seated themselves in solemn assembly and proceeded
to do honour to Marduk, the Creator, by reciting
before him the remarkable series of addresses which
form the contents of the last Tablet of the poem.
Many of the missing portions of the Seventh Tablet,
including the opening lines, it has been found possible
to restore from the new fragments and duplicates
here published.
In the following pages a transliteration of the text
of the Creation Series is given, which has been
constructed from all the tablets and fragments now
known to be inscribed with portions of the poem,
together with a translation and notes. For comparison with the legends contained in the Creation
Series, translations have been added of the other
Babylonian accounts of the history of Creation, and
of some texts closely connected therewith. Among

XX

PREFACE

these mention may be made of the extracts from
a Sumerian text, and from a somewhat similar one
in Babylonian, referring to the Creation of the Moon
and the Sun ; these are here published from a so-called
" practice-tablet," or student's exercise. A remarkable
address to a mythical river, to which the creation of
the world is ascribed, is also given.
I n the first Appendix the Assyrian commentaries to
the Seventh Tablet are examined in detail, and some
fragments of texts are described which bear a striking
resemblance to the Seventh Tablet, and are of considerable interest for the light they throw on the
literary history of the poem. Among the texts dealt
with in the second Appendix one of the most interesting
is a Babylonian duplicate of the tablet which has been
supposed to contain the instructions given by Marduli
to man after his creation, but is now shown by the
duplicate to be part of a long didactic composition
containing moral precepts, and to have nothing to do
with the Creation Series. Similarly, in the fourth
Appendix I have printed a copy of the text which has
been commonly, but erroneously, supposed to refer to
the Tower of Babel. The third Appendix includes
some hitherto unpublished astrological texts of the
period of the Arsacidae, which contain astrological
interpretations and explanations of episodes of the
Creation story; they indicate that Tiamat, in her
astrological character, was regarded as a star or
constellation in the neighbourhood of the ecliptic,

and they moreover furnish an additional proof of
'the identification of her monster brood with at any
rate some of the Zodiacal constellations.
During the preparation of this work I have, of
course, consulted the translations and renderings of
the Creation Legends which have been made by
other workers on the subject, and especially those
of Professors Jensen, Zimmern, and Delitzsch. I have
much pleasure in expressing here my indebtedness to
their published works for suggestions which I have
adopted from them.
T o Mr. R. Campbell Thompson I am indebted for
the ready assistance he has afforded me during my
search for new fragments and duplicates of the
legends.
In conclusion, my thanks are due to Dr. Wallis
Budge for his friendly suggestions which I have
adopted throughout the progress of the work.

THEgreat Assyrian poem, or series of legends, which TheCreat~on
Scner,

narrates the story of the Creation of the world and of eltih.
"Enuma
man, was termed by the Assyrians and Babylonians
Enunza elif, "When in the height," from the two
opening words of the text. T h e poem consisted of
some nine hundred and ninety-four lines, and was
divided into seven sections, each of which was inscribed
upon a separate Tablet. T h e Tablets were numbered
by the Assyrian scribes, and the separate sections of
the poem written upon them do not vary very much
in length. T h e shortest Tablet contains one hundred
and thirty-eight lines, and the longest one hundred and
forty-six, the average length of a Tablet being about
one hundred and forty-two lines. T h e poem embodies
the beliefs of the Babylonians and Assyrians concerning the origin of the universe; it describes the
coming forth of the gods from chaos, and tells the
story of how the forces of disorder, represented by
the primeval water-gods Apsii and Tiamat, were overthrown by E a and Marduk respectively, and how
Marduk, after completing the triumph of the gods over
chaos, proceeded to create the world and man. T h e
poem is known to us from portions of several Assyrian
and late-Babylonian copies of the work, and from

extracts from it written out upon the so-called "practicetablets," or students' exercises, by pupils of the
Babylonian scribes. The Assyrian copies of the work
are from the great library which was founded at
Nineveh by Ashur-bani-pal, king of Assyria from
B.C. 668 to about B.C. 626 ; the Babylonian copies and
extracts were inscribed during the period of the kings
of the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods ; and one
copy of the Seventh Tablet may probably be assigned
to as late a date as the period of the Arsacidae.
All the tablets and fragments, which have hitherto
been identified as inscribed with portions of the text
of the poem, are preserved in the British Museum.
From. the time of the first discovery of fragments
~f the poem considerable attention has been directed
towards them, for not only are the legends themselves
the principal source of our knowledge of the Babylonian costnogony, but passag-es in them bear a strilring
resemblance to the cognate narratives in the Book
of Genesis concerning the creation of the world.
T h e late Mr. George Smith, who was the first to
~ u b l i s han account of the poem, recognized this
resemblance and emphasized it in his papers on
In the following year in
the subject in 1875.'

' Mr. Smith described the legends in a letter to the Daily
Telegraph, published on March 4th, 1875, No. 6,158, p. j, col. 4.
He there gave a summary of the contents of the fragments, and on
November 2nd in the same year he read a paper on them before the

which had been identified, and the copies which he
had made of the principal fragments were p ~ b l i s h e d . ~
After Smith's death the interest in the texts which he
had published did not cease, and scholars continued
to produce renderings and studies of the legendss
~ o c i e t y o Biblical
f
Archieology. I n noting the resemblance between
the Babylonian and the Hebrew legends it was not unnatural that
he should have seen a closer resemblance between them than was
really the case. For instance, he traced allusions to " t h e Fall of
Man" in what is the Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series; one
tablet he interpreted as containing the instructions given by "the
Deity" to man after his creation, and another he believed to
represent a version of the story of the Tower of Babel. Although
these identificationswere not justified, the outline which he gave
of the contents of the legends was remarkably accurate. I t is
declared by some scholars that the general character of the larger
of the Creation fragments was correctly identified by Sir H. C.
Rawlinson several years before.

By November, 1875. Smith had prepared a series of six plates
containing copies of portions of the First and Fifth Tablets, and
also of the Fourth Tablet which he entitled "War between the
Gods and Chaos," and of the Seventh Tablet which he styled
"Tablet describing the Fall." These plates were published in
the Transactions of the Socieb of Bdlical A~ch@oZogy,vol. iv (1876).
and appeared after his death.

Recent transluuons of the
legends.

INTRODUCTION.

In 1883 Dr. Wallis Budge gave an account of a fine
Babylonian duplicate of what proved to be the Fourth
Tablet of the Creation Series ; this document restored
considerable portions of the narrative of the fight
between Marduk and the dragon Tiamat, and added
considerably to our knowledge of the story of Creation
and of the order in which the events related in the
story took place.' In the Hibbert Lectures for 1887
Professor Sayce translated the new fragment of the
text,= and in the following year published a complete
translationS of all fragments of the Creation Legends
which had up to that time been identified. In 1890
Professor Jensen, in his studies on the Babylonian
cosmogony, included a translation of the legends
together with a transliteration and a number of
valuable philological notes and discussion^.^ In 1895

I'histoire (1880), app. i, pp. qgqff. T h e best discussion of the
relations of the legends to the early chapters of Genesis was
given by Schrader in the second edition (1883) of his Keilinschrvten und das Alte Testament, English translation, 1885-1888 ;
I hear from Professor Zimmern that the new edition of this work,
a portion of which he is editing, will shortly make its appearance.
T h e tablet was numbered 82-9-18, 3,737 ; see below, p. cvi,
No. 29. Budge gave a description of the tablet in the Proceedings
of the Society of Biblical Archeology for Nov. bth, 1883, and
published the text in P.S.B.A., vol. x (1887), p. 86, pls. 1-6.

Professor Zimmern published a translation of the
translations of the
legends, similar in plan to Sayce's earlier edition ; in legends.
it he took advantage of some recently identified
fragments and duplicates, and put forward a number
of new renderings of difficult passages.' In 1896
a third German translation of the legends made its
appearance ; it was published by Professor Delitzsch
and included transliterations and descriptions of the
various tablets and fragments inscribed with portions
of the text.% Finally, in 1900 Professor Jensen
published a second edition of his rendering of the
legends in his Mythen und Epen ; this worli was
the best which could be prepared with the material

m d a l precepts, and has no connection with the Creation Series.
H e also included K. 3,445 R. 396 (as No. zo), but there are
strong reasons for believing that this tablet does not belong to the
series Enuma elii", but is part of a variant account of the story of
Creation; see further, Appendix 11, pp. 197ff. On the other
hand he necessarily omitted from his list an unnumbered fragment
of the Seventh Tablet, which had been used by George Smith,
but had been lost sight of after his death; this fragment I
identified two years ago a s I<. 9,267. I t may be added that the
total number of fragments ,correctly identified up to that time n,as
twenty-five, but, as four of these had been joined to others, the
number of separate tablets and fragments was reduced to twenty-one.

of the text of the Creation Series is thus brought up
to forty-nine.' T h e new material is distributed among

INTRODUCTION.

and of its Neo-Babylonian duplicate 82-7-14, 402,'
breaks off at 1. 15, the course of the story after this
point has hitherto been purely a matter for conjecture.
It appeared probable that the lines which followed
contained a full account of the origin of the younger
gods, and from the fact that Damascius states that
Bijhos, the Creator of the world, was the son of )A&(i.e. Ea) and A c c ; ~ ~(i.e. Damkina), it has been
concluded that at any rate special prominence was
given to the birth of Bel, i.e. Marduk, who figurcs
so prominently in the story from the close of the
Second Tablet onwards.
T h e new
fragments
of ~the First~ Tablet i show that
~
~
~
~
the account of the birth of the gods in the Creation
Series is even shorter than that given by Damascius,
for the poem contains no mention of the birth and
parentage of Marduli. After mentioning the birth of
Nudimmud (i.e. Ea),2 the text proceeds to describe
his marvellous wisdom and strength, and states that
he had no rival among the gods ; the birth of no
other god is recorded after that of Ea, and, when
Marduk is introduced later on, his existence, like that
of Mummu and of Gaga, appears to be tacitly assumed.
It would seem, therefore, that the reference made by

to that of E a may at first sight seem strange, but it
is in accordance with the other newly recovered
portions of the text of the First and Second Tablets,
which indirectly throw an interesting light on the
composite character and literary history of the great
poem.' I t will be seen that of the deities mentioned
in these earlier lines Nudimmud (Ea) is the only god
whose characteristics are described in detail ; his birth,
moreover, forms the climax to which the previous
lines lead up, and, after the description of his character,

that his slothful rest was disturbed by the new ordcr

and lying down before her, took counsel with her

T h e MwCpir of Damascius ; see above, p. xxxiii, n. I . T h e
title Mummu was not only borne by Apsu's minister, who, according
to Darnascius, was the son of Apsu and Tiamat, but in Tabl. I , I. 4,
it is employed as a prefix to the name of Tiamat herself. I n this
passage I have conjecturally rendered it as chaos" (see p. z f.),
since the explanatory text S. 747, Rev., I. l o (see below,
pp. 16z, 170)~gives the equation Mu-um-mu = ?if-mu. There is,
however, much to be said for Jensen's suggestion of the existence
of a word mummu meaning "form," or "mould," or "pattern"
(cf. Mythen und Epen, p. 302 f.). Jensen points out that E a is
termed mu-um-mu & - a n ka-la, <'the mummu (possibly, pattern)
who created all" (cf. Beitriige zur Asyriolofie, ii, p. 2 6 1 ) , and he
adds that the title might have been applied in this sense to
Tiamat, since in Tabl. I, 1. I I j, and the parallel passages, she is
described as pa-ti-$a-at ha-la-ma, and from her body heaven and
earth were created ; the explanation, given by Damascius, of
Mummu, the son of Apsu and Tiamat, as voviis xdopor is also
in favour of this suggestion. Moreover, from one of the new
fragments of the Seventh Tablet, I<. 13,761 (seep. 1 0 2 f.), we now
know that one of Marduk's fifty titles was Mummu, which is there
explained'as ha-a[n . . 1, i.e., probably, 6a-a[n ka-la], "Creator
[of all] " (cf. Ea's title, cited above). I n view of the equation
Mu-um-mu = rig-mu (Jensen's suggested alternatives Sim-mu and
6i-&mu are not probable), we may perhaps conclude that, in
addition to the word mummu, "form, pattern," there existed
a word mummu, "chaos, confusion," and that consequently the
title Mummu was capable of two separate interpretations. I f such
be the case, it is possible that the application of the title to
Tiamat and her son was suggested by its ambiguity of meaning;
while Marduk (and also Ea) might have borne the name as the
"form" o r "idea" of order and system, Tiamat and her son
might have been conceived as representing the opposing " form "
or " idea" of chaos and confusion.

regarding the means to be adopted to restore the
old order of things. I t may be noted that the
text contains no direct statement that it was the
creation of light which caused the rebellion of the Hishatredof
"order," nut
primeval gods.' ApsE merely states his hatred of ,-ii,hl.,p
the a&tu or "way" of the gods, in consequence
of which he can get no rest by day or night; and,
from the fact that he makes use of the expressions
"by day" and "by night," it may be inferred that
day and night were vaguely conceived as already in
existence. It was therefore the substitution of order
in place of chaos which, according to the text of
the poem, roused ApsG's resentment and led to his
rebellion and d o ~ n f a l l . ~

'

Jensen's translation of what is 1. 50 of the First Tablet
represents Mummu as urging Apsfi to make the way of the gods
"like night," and implies that it was the creation of light which
caused the rebellion. L. 50, however, is parallel to 1. 38, and it is
certain that the adv. mu-%is to be rendered " b y night," and not
I' like night."
I n 1. 38 Apse complains that "by day'' he cannot
rest, and "by night" he cannot lie down in peace ; Mummu then
counsels him to destroy the way of the gods, adding in 1. 50,
" T h e n by day shalt thou have rest, by night shalt thou lie down
(in peace)" ; see pp. 8 ff. Jmsen's suggested rendering of im-ma
as-7%-nik-ma,in place of iv~-ma-a$-ru-nim-ma,
in Tabl. I, 1. log
and the parallel passages, is therefore also improbable.
a This fact does not preclude the interpretation of the fight
between Marduk and Tiamat as based upon a nature-myth,
representing the disappearance of mist and darkness before the
rays of the sun. For Marduk was originally a solar deity, and
Berossus himself mentions this interpretation of the legend (see
further, p. lxxxii, and the quotation on p. livf., notes z and I).

Our knowledge of the part played by Ea in the
overthrow of Apsii and Mummu is still fragmentary,
Mummuby Ea.
but we know from 1. 60 of the First Tablet that it was
he who detected the plot against the gods ; it is also
certain that the following twenty lines recorded the
fate of Apsn and his minister, and there are clear
indications that it was E a to whom their overthrow
was due. I n Tablet 11, 11. 53 ff., Anshar, on lcarning
from E a the news of Tiamat's preparations for battle,
contrasts the conquest of Mummu and Apst with the
task of opposing Tiamat, and the former achievement
he implies has been accomplished by Ea. It is clear,
therefore, that E a caused the overthrow of Apsnl and
the capture of Mummu,%but in what way he brought
it about, whether by actual fighting or by "his pure
incantation," is still a matter for conjecture. In view
of the fact that Anshar at first tried peaceful means
for overcoming Tiamat before exhorting Marduk to
wage battle against her, the latter supposition is the
more probable of the two. T h e subjugation of Apsn
by E a explains his subsequent disappearance from
the Creation story. When Apsii is next mentioned,
it is as "the Deep," and not as an active and
Tiamat's
malevolent deity.

own person the unsubdued forces of chaos.' But,
as at first she had not herself begun the rebellion,
so now her continuation of the war against the
gods was due to the prompting of another deity.
T h e speech in which this deity urges Tiamat
to avenge ApsE and Mummu occurs in Tablet I,
11.93-104, and, inasmuch as she subsequently promoted
Kingu

to play the chief r6le on the side of the gods. He
heard of Tiamat's preparations for battle, he carried
the news to Anshar, his father, and he was sent by

repeated in Tablet I I I, 11. I 5-52 ; and that Tablet I I I,
11. I 5-66, are repeated in the same Tablet, 11. 73-1 2 4 .
The lines which are repeated have reference to
Tiamat's preparations for battle against the gods,
and to Anshar's summons of the gods in order that
they may confer power on Mardulc as their champion.
From the new fragments of the text we now know
that the lines relating to Tiamat's preparations occur
on the First Tablet in the form of narrative,
immediately after she had adopted Kingu's suggestion
that she should avenge the overthrow of ApsG and
Mummu ; and that in the Second Tablet they are
repeated by E a in his speech to Anshar, to whom
he carried the news. The context of the repetitions
in the Third Tablet is already known ; Anshar first
repeats the lines to his minister Gaga, when telling
him to go and summon the gods to a n assembly, and
later on in the Tablet Gaga repeats the message
word for word to Lahmu and Lahamu.
T h e constant repetition of these lines was doubtless
intended to emphasize the terrible nature of the
opposition which Marduk successfully overcame ; and
the fact that Berossus omits all mention of the part
played by E a in the earlier portions of the story is
also due to the tendency of the Babylonian priests
to exalt their local god at the expense of other deities.
T h e account which we have received from Berossus
of the Babylonian beliefs concerning the origin of the
universe is largely talien up with a description of

while the creatures themselves represent the monsterbrood which Tiamat formed to aid her in her fight
against the gods.' Compared with the description of
the monsters, the summary from Berossus of the
incidents related on the Fourth Tablet is not very full ;
the text states that BGhor (i.e. Bel) slew 'OPc$xa,

by suggesting that 'OpGpra= U m n z u - ~ h i ,and u l k i he talies as
a n Assyrian translation o f e u h u r . F o r ti;rhur he suggests t h e
meaning "that which is above, the North" (mainly from the
occnrrcnce o f F u - b u - r ~ =

~
the Uppcr o r Northern
part of Mesopotamia, in 11 R, pl. 50, I. 51, cf. also V R, pl. 16.
1. 1 9 ) ; and, since what is in the North would have hecn regarded
by the Babylonians as "behind," t h e title @6ar might have been
rendered in Babylonian as urhu. This e x p l a n a t i o ~is~ ingenious,
but that t h e title e u b u r , as applied t o Tiamat, had t h e meaning
"that which is above, t h e North," cannot be regarded as proved
(cf. also Mythen, p. 5 6 4 ) Gunkel and Zimmern, on the othcr
hand, see in 'Opdpra t h e equivalent of t h e Aramaic words 'Om ' o r p ,
"Mother of the Deep," t h e existence of which they trace to the
prevalence of t h e Aramaic dialect in Babylonia a t the time of
Berossus (see SchZpfung und Chaos, p. 18 f., n. I ) ; according t o
this explanation the title 'OILdi,ra would he the Aramaic equivalent
of Ummu-&bur,
for @uhur may well have had the meaning
"deep, depth."
Thus, on t h e fragment S. 2,013 (sce below,
p. 196 f.) t h e meaning "depth," rather than " t h e North," is
suggested by t h e word ; in I. 9 of this fragment t h e phrase &-bar
pal-ha-ti, " t h e broad Bobur," is employed in antithesis to {anzE(r)
ru-&u-u-IL; " t h e distant heavens," precisely a s in t h e following
couplet Ti-amat tap-li-ti, " t h e Lower Ocean (Tiamat)," is opposed
t o Ti-amaf e-li-fi, " t h e Upper Ocean (Tiamat)." F o r a possible
connection between the lower waters of Tiamat and Huhur, thc River
of the Underworld, see below, p. Ixxxiii, n. z, and p. xcivf., n. 3 .

' According t o the poem, Tiamat is definitely stated t o have

In view, however, of the

ofvegetation. statement of Berossus that from one half of Tiamat
Be1 formed the earth, we may conjecture that an
account of the creation of the earth occurred upon
some part of the Fifth Tablet. It is also probable
that the Fifth Tablet recorded the creation of
vegetation. That this formed the subject of some
portion of the poem is certain from the opening lines
of the Seventh Tablet,. where Marduk is hailed as
" Asari, ' Bestower of planting,' ' [Founder of sowing],'
' Creator of grain and plants,' ' who caused [the green
herb to spring up] ! ' " ; and the creation of plants and
herbs would naturally follow that of the earth.
Thecreation
From the new fragment of the Sixth Tablet,

No. 92,629, we know that this portion of the poem
related the story of the creation of man. As at the
north pole of the equator), and E a (probably a star in the extreme
south of the heavens) as guides to the stars, proving that they
were already thus employed in astronomical calculations. I n place
of Ea, K. 13,774 substitutes Anu, who, as the pole star of the
ecliptic, would be of equal, if not greater, importance in an astronomical sense. Another variant reading on K. 13,774 is the
substitution of hakkada-Tu, "his star," in place of ""Nannar-ru,
the Moon-god, in 1. 1 2 ; the context is broken, hut we cannot
doubt that iuk-nal mu-s'l; " a being of the night," in 1. 13 refers
to the Moon-god, and that Rlarduk entrusted the night to the
Moon-god according to this version also. Further variants occur
in I. 17 f. in the days enumerated in the course of l\.larduk's
address to the Moon-god ; see below, p. I ~ f.I

have "devised a cunning plan " ' while gazing upon
the dead body of Tiamat, so now, before proceeding
to man's creation, it is said that "his heart prompted
him and he devised [a cunning ~ l a n l . " ~In the
repetition of this phrase we may see an indication
of the importance which was ascribed to this portion
of the story, and it is probable that the creation of
man was regarded a s the culmination of Mardulr's
creative work. It is interesting to note, however,
that the creation of man is not related as a natural
sequel to the formation of the rest of the universe,
but forms the solution of a difficulty with which
Marduk has been met in the course of his work as
Creator. T o overcome this difficulty Marduk devised
the " cunning plan " already referred to ; the context
of this passage is not very clear, but the reason for
man's creation may be gathered from certain indications in the text.
W e learn from the beginning of the Sixth Tablet Thereasonof
m a n s creati011
that Marduk devised. his cunning plan after he had
"heard the word of the gods," and from this it is
clear that the Fifth Tablet ends with a speech of
the gods. Now in Tablet VI, 1. 8, Mardulr states
that he will create man "that the service of the gods
may be established " ; in 1. 9 f., however, he adds that

will change the ways of the gods, and he appears
to threaten them with punishment. I t may be conjectured, therefore, that after Mardulc had completed
the creation of the world, the gods came to him and
complained that there were no shrines built in their
honour, nor was there anyone to worship them. T o
supply this need Marduk formed the device of creating
man, but at the same time he appears to have decided
to vent his wrath upon the gods because of their
discontent. I t is possible, however, that Ea dissuaded
Marduk from punishing the gods, though he no doubt
assisted him in carrying out the first part of his
proposal.'

Marduk states that he will use his own blood for man'scrcation
creating man ; the text of this passage from Berossus
is thus shown to be correct, and it follows that the
account which he gave of the Babylonian beliefs
concerning man's creation does not require to be
emended or explained away.

' I n the Zeits. fc2r Asvr., xiv, p. 282, Zimmern remarks: " Somit
darf man wol doch nicht . . . annehmen, dass urspriinglich
" das Blut der Tiimat gemeint sei, allerdings auch nicht das Blut
" des Schopfergottes selbst, sondern das irgend eines Gottes
. ,
" der zu diesem Zwecke geschlachtet wird."
I n making this
suggestion Zimmern was influenced by the episode related in
col. iii of the fragmentary and badly preserved legend Bu. 91-5-9,
269 (cf. Cunez~ormT t x f s , pt. vi, and Mythen, p. 275, note), which
he pointed out contained a speech by a deity in which he gives
orders for another god to be slain that apparently a man may be
formed from his blood mixed with clay (cf. Z.A., xiv, p. 281).
The episode, however, has no connection with the first creation
of man, but probably relates to the creation of a man or hero to
perform some special exploit, in the same way as Uddrrshu-namir
was created by E a for the rescue of Ishtar from the Underworld,
and as Ea-bani was created by the goddess Aruru in the First
Tablet of the Gilgamesh-epic (cf. also Jensen's remarks in his
Myfhen und Epen, p, 275 f.). I learn from Professor Zimmern and
Professor Bezold that it was the tablet Bu. 91-5-9, 269, and not
an actual fragment of the Creation Series, to which Professor
Zimmern refers on p. 1 4 of his Blalische und ba6ylonische
Urgeschichfe. Although, as already stated, this fragment is not,
strictly speaking, part of a creation-legend, it illustrates the fact
that the use of the blood of a god for the creation of man was
fully in accordance with Babylonian beliefs.

INTRODUCTION.

Jensen has already suggested ' that the god whom
Be1 addressed was Ea, and the new fragment of. the
Sixth Tablet proves that this suggestion is correct.
In the Sixth Tablet Marduk recounts to E a his
intention of forming man, and tells him the means he
will employ. W e may therefore conclude that it
was E a who beheaded Marduk at his request, and,
according to his instructions, formed mankind from
his blood. E a may thus have performed the actual
work of making man, but he acted under Mardult's
directions, and it is clear from Tablet VII, 11. 29
and 32, that Marduk, and not Ea, was regarded as
man's Crea.tor.
he method of
According to Berossus, man was formed from the
m d s meation.
blood of BE1 mixed with earth. T h e new fragment
of the Sixth Tablet does not mention the mixing of
the blood with earth, but it is quite possible that this
detail was recounted in the subsequent narrative. On
the other hand, in the Babylonian poem Marduk
declares that, in addition to using his own blood, he
will create bone for forming man. Berossus makes
no mention of bone, but it is interesting- to note that
k i m t u , the Assyrian word here. used for " bone," is
doubtless the equivalent of the Hebrew word 'esem,

Ea's share in
man's creation.

' See Kosmolo~ie,p. 293.
T h e word is here met with for the first time, the reading of

the.creation of woman in Gen. ii, 23.
T h e blood of BE1, according to Berossus, was ~ h e c r ~ z t i o n

employed not only in man's creation but in that of
animals also, and it is possible that this represents the
form of the legend as it was preserved upon the Sixth
Tablet. Though, in that case, the creation of animals
would follow that of man, the opening lines of the
Sixth Tablet prove that man's creation was regarded
as the culmination of Marduk's creative work. T h e
"cunning plan," which Marduli devised in order to
furnish worshippers for the gods, concerned the
creation of man, and if that of animals followed it
must have been recorded as a subsidiary and less
important act.' In this connection it may be noted
that the expression T& ~ U U & , U E U C I rbv &;pa $ J ~ ~ E I V ,
which Berossus applies to the men and animals
created from the blood of Bel, was probably not based
on any description or episode in the Creation story as
' I

On p. zoo it is remarked that, until more of the text of the Fifth
and Sixth Tablets is recovered, it would be rash to assert that the
fragment K. 3,445 R. 396 (cf. Cun. Texfs, pt. xiii, pl. 24 f.)
cannot belong to the Creation Series. T h e phrase if-Run Pahkada
(Ohv., 1. 35) might perhaps refer to the head of Tiamat (cf. ru-juUS-fuda Ti-n[nzat], in 1. zq), which would not be inconsistent with
the fragment forming part of the Fifth Tablet as suggested on
p. 198. If the fragment were part of the Sixth Tablet, the kakhadu
in 1. 35 might possibly be Marduk's head (compare also i7z-~ur.-ma
in 1. 31 with lu-uk-surin Tahl. VI, 1. 5 ) . I n view, however, of the
inconsistencies noted on p. 199 f., it is preferable to exclude the
fragment at present from the Creation Series.

other reasons there enumerated, it may be stated that
there would be no room upon the Sixth Tablet of

precepts as is inscribed upon the tablets K. 3,364 and
No. 33,851. I t may be that Marduli, after creating
man, gave him some instructions with regard to the
worship of the gods and the building of shrines in
their honour, but the greater part of the text must

' I n view of the fact that the Semitic name BZZ-maliTLioccurs as

which is applied to him in the Epilogue to the Seventh Tablet
(I. rzg, see p. r rz), also occurred as one of his fifty titles in the
body of the text. It is unlikely that the name Marduk itself was
included as one of the fifty titles, and in slipport of this view it
may be noted that the colophon to the commentary R. 366, etc.
(see p. 169), makes mention of "fifty-one names" of Marduk,
which may be most easily'explained by supposing that the scribe
reckoned in the name Marduk as an additional title.

Babylonian priests. Five principal strands may be
traced which have been combined to form the poem ;

T h e Hymn to Marduk under his fifty titles. Since
the poem in its present form is a glorification ,of
Marduk as the champion of the gods and the Creator
of the world, it is natural that more prominence should
be given to episodes in which Marduk is the hero
than is assigned to other portions of the narrative in
which he plays no part. Thus the description of
Tiamat and her monster-brood, whom Marduli conquered, is repeated no less than four times,' and the
preparations of Marduli for battle and his actual fight
with the dragon take up the greater part of the Fourth
Tablet. On the other hand, the birth of the older
gods, among whom Marduk does not figure, is confined to the first twenty-one lines of the First Tablet ;
and not more than twenty lines are given to the Elementsin
account of the subjugation of Apsii by Ea. That t!6:z2ted

these elements should have been incorporated at all

be explained by the fact that they serve to enhance

INTRODUCTION.

Marduk. Thus the description of the birth of the
older gods and of the opposition they excited among
the forces of disorder, was necessarily included in
order to make it clear how Marduli was appointed
their champion ; and the account of Ea's success
against Apsii served to accentuate the terrible nature
of Tiamat, whom he was unable to withstand. From
the latter half of the Second Tablet onwards, Marduli
alone is the hero of the poem.
T h e central episode of the poem is the fight
between Marduk and Tiamat, and there is evidence
to Drove that this legend existed in other forms than
that under which it occurs in the Creation Series.
T h e conquest of the dragon was ascribed by the
Babylonian priests to their local god, and in the poem
the death of Tiamat is made a necessary preliminary
to the creation of the world. On a fragment of
a tablet from Ashur - bani -pal's library we possess,
however, part of a copy of a legend' which describes
the conquest of a dragon by some deity other than
M a r d ~ k . ~Moreover, the fight is there described as
taking place, not before creation, but at a time when
men existed and cities had been built. In this version

Jensen makes Bel the slayer of the dragon in this legend
(cf. Mythen und Epen, p. 46), from which it might be argued that
Marduk is the hero in both versions of the story. But Jensen's
identification of the deity as Bel was due to a mistake of Delitzsch,
who published an inaccurate copy of the traces of the deity's name
upon the tablet; see below, p. 120, n. I.

men and gods are described as equally terrified at the
dragon's appearance, and it was to deliver the land
from the monster that one of the gods went out and
slew him. This fragmentary tablet serves to prove
that the Dragon-Myth existed in more than one form
in Babylonian mythology, and it is not improbable
that. many of the great cities of Babylonia possessed
local versions of the legend in each of which the
city-god figured as the hero.'

of the story represents the belief most generally
held during the reigns of the later Assyrian and
Babylonian kings. W e possess, however, fragments
of other legends in which the creation of the world
is not connected with the death of a dragon. In one
of these, which is written both in Sumerian and
Babylonian,' the great Babylonian cities and temples
are described as coming into existence in consequence
of a movement in the waters which alone existed
before the creation of the world. Marduk in this

' The so-called "CuthaeanLegend of the Creation" (cf. pp. 14off.)
was at one time believed to represent another local verslon of the
Creation story, in which Nergal, the god of Cuthah, was supposed
to take the place of Marduk. But it has been pointed out by
Zimmern that the legend concerns the deeds of an Old-Babylonian
king of Cuthah, and is not a Creation legend; see below, p. 140 f.,

version also figures as the Creator, for, together with
the goddess Aruru,' he created man by laying a reed
upon the face of the waters and forming dust which
he poured out beside it ; according to this version also
he is described as creating animals and vegetation.
In other legends which have come down to us, not
only is the story of Creation uncorlnected with the
Dragon-Myth, but Mardulc does not figure as the
Creator. In one of these "the gods" generally are
referred to as having created the heavens and the
earth and the cattle and beasts of the field ;' while
in another the creation of the Moon and the Sun is
ascribed to Anu, Bel, and E a 3

resemblance to that employed in the creation of man according
to the Sumerian and Babylonian version above referred t o ; she
first washed her hands, and then, breaking o f a piece of clay,

in Upshukkinaku ; and to it is added the epilogue of
eighteen lines, which completes the Seventh Tablet of
the series.
it is possible to find traces of other less important traditions which
have been woven into the structure of the poem. Thus the
association of the god Kingu with Tiamat is probably due to the
incorporation of a separate legend with the Dragon-Myth.
I t may be here noted that the poem contains no direct
description of Tiamat, and it has been suggested that in it she
was conceived, not as a dragon, but as a woman. T h e evidence
from sculpture and from cylinder-seals, however, may he cited
against this suggestion, as well as several phrases in the poem
itself (cf. e.g., Tabl. IV, 11. 97 ff.). I t is true that in one of the
new fragments of the poem Tiamat is referred to as sinnijatu,
i.e. "woman" or "female " (cf. Tabl. 11, 1. I Z Z ) , hut the context
of this passage proves that the phrase is employed with reference
to her sex and not to her form.

INTRODUCTION.

In discussing the question as to the date of the
Creation legends, it is necessary to distinguish clearly
between the date at which the legends assumed the
form in which they have come down to us upon the
Seven Tablets of the series Enulna eZiS, and the
date which may be assigned to the legends themselves before they were incorporated in the poem.
Of the actual tablets inscribed with portions of the
text of the Creation Series we possess none which
dates from an earlier period than the seventh
century B.C. T h e tablets of this date were made
for the library of Ashur-bani-pal a t Nitleveh, but it is
obvious that the poem was not composed in Assyria
a t this time. T h e legends in the form in which we
possess them are not intended to glorify Ashur, the
national god of Assyria, but Marduk, the god of
Babylon, and it is clear that the scribes of Ashurbani-pal merely made copies for their master of
older tablets of Babylonian origin. T o what earlier
date we may assign the actual composition of the
poem and its arrangement upon the Seven Tablets,
is still a matter for conjecture; but it is possible to
offer a conjecture, with some degree of probability,
after an examination of the various indirect sources
of evidence we possess with regard to the age of
Babylonian legends in general, and of the Creation
legends in particular.
With regard to the internal evidence of date furnished by the Creation legends themselves, we may

note that the variant forms of the Dragon-Myth and
of the account of the Creation, to which reference
has already been made, presuppose many centuries of
tradition during which the legends, though derived
probably from common originals, were handed down
independently of one another. During this period we
may suppose that the same story was related in
different cities in different ways, and that in course of
time variations crept in, with the result that two or
more forms of the same story were developed along
different lines. T h e process must have been gradual,
and the considerable differences which can be traced in
the resultant forms of the same legend may be cited as
evidence in favour of assigning an early date to the
original tradition from which they were derived.

at least as early as the ninth century B.C. may be sfrom
cylinderdeduced from the representations of the fight between '*''
Marduli and the dragon Tiamat, which was found
sculptured upon two limestone slabs in the temple
of Ninib at Nimrnd.' T h e temple was built by Ashurnasir-pal, who reigned from B.C. 884 to B.C. 860, and
across the actual sculpture was inscribed the text of
a dedication to Ninib by this king. T h e slab therefore furnishes direct proof of the existence of the

formation of Ashur-bani-pal's library. Moreover, the
fight between Marduk and Tiamat is frequently found
engraved upon cylinder-seals, and, although the
majority of such seals probably date from the later
Assyrian and Persian periods, the varied treatment of
the scene which they present points to the existence of
variant forms of the legend, and so indirectly furnishes
evidence of the early origin of the legend itself.

From an examination of the Babylonian historical

to trace back the existence of the Creation legends
to still earlier periods. For instance, in a text of
Agum,' a Babylonian king who reigned not later than
the seventeenth century B.c., we find descriptions of
the figures of a dragon and of other monsters which
he set up in the temple E-sagil at Babylon ; and in
this passage we may trace an unmistakable reference
to the legend of Tiamat and her monster-brood.
Agum also set up in the temple beside the dragon
a great basin, or laver, termed in the inscription
a tiimtu, or "sea."4 From the name of the laver,
and from its position beside the figure of the dragon,

earlier periods we find allusions to similar vessels
termed a@;, i.e. " deeps " or " oceans," ' the presence
of which in the temples is probably to be traced to the
existence of the same traditions.
The three classes of evidence briefly summarized
above tend to show that the most important elements
in the Creation legends were not of late origin, but
must be traced back in some form or other to remote
periods, and may well date from the first half of the
third millennium B.c., or even earlier. I t remains to
consider to what date we may assign the actual
weaving together of these legends into the poem
termed by the Babylonians and Assyrians Enuma eZii".

and to the same period is to be assigned the fragment
of a legend which was published a few weeks ago by
Dr. Meissner,' and probably also the new fragment of
the Etana-myth, published last year by Father Scheil.'
These five fragments are of peculiar interest, for they
show that early Semitic, as opposed to Sumerian,
legends were in existence, and were carefully preserved and studied in other cities of Mesopotamia
carefully written (it may he noted that a na.has been omitted by
the scribe in No. 93,828, col. i, 1. 7), the lines vary considerably
in length, and the metre is not indicated by the arrangement of
the text. Though fragmentary the episodes described or referred
to in the texts are of considerable interest, perhaps the most
striking being the reference to the birth of Ishum in col. viii of
No. 87,521, and the damming of the Tigris with which the text
of No. 87,535 concludes. I intend elsewhere to publish translations
of the fragments.

The Sumerian version of the story of the Creation by Marduk and

evidence of its Sun~erianorigin, as from internal evidence it may
well be a later and artificial composition on Sumerian lines. That
we may expect,, however, one day to find the original Surnerian

to the recovery of the ancient religious literature of the Sumerians,

Egyptians hear a more striking resemblance to the
corresponding legends of Babylonia. Whether this
resemblance was due to the proto-Semitic strain which
probably existed in the ancient Egyptian race,' or is
to be explained as the result of later Babylonian
influence from without, is yet uncertain. But, whatever
explanation be adopted, it is clear that the conception
of chaos as a watery mass out of which came forth
successive generations of primeval gods is common
to both races.' It is in Hebrew literature, however,
that the most striking examples of the influence of the
Babylonian Creation legends are to be found.

new points of resemblance between them may here
be
briefly discussed. According to each account the

existence of a watery chaos preceded the creation of
the universe ; and the Hebrew word teham, translated
"the deep" in Gen. i, 2, is the equivalent of the
Babylonian Tiamat, the monster of the deep personifying chaos and confusion. In the details of the
Creation there is also a close resemblance between
(1)Thecreation the two accounts.
In the Hebrew narrative the first

act of creation is that of light (Gen. i, 3 - 5 ) and it
has been suggested that a parallel possibly existed
in the Babylonian account, in that the creation of
light may have been the cause of the revolt of
Tiamat. From the new fragments of the poem we
now know that the rebellion of the forces of disorder,
which was incited by Apsii and not Tiamat, was
sue, not to the creation of light, but to his hatred
of the way of the gods which produced order in
place of chaos.= A parallelism may still be found,
however; in the original form of the Babylonian myth,
according to which the conqueror of the dragon was
undoubtedly a solar deity.3 Moreover, as has been
pointed out above,4 day and night are vaguely conceived in the poem as already in existence at the

time of Apsii's revolt, so that the belief in the
existence of light before the creation of the heavenly
bodies is a common feature of the Hebrew and the
Babylonian account.
T h e second act of creation in the Hebrew narrative (3)Thecreation
of a firmament.
is that of a firmament which divided the waters that
were under the firmament from the waters that were
above the firmament (Gen. i, 6-8). I n the Babylonian
poem the body of Tiamat is divided by Marduli, and
from one-half of her he formed a covering or dome
for heaven, i.e. a firmament, which kept her upper
waters in place. Moreover, on the fragment S. 2,013
we find mention of a Ti-amat e-Zi-ti and a Ti-nmat
+-&ti, that is, an Upper Tiamat (or Ocean) and
a Lower Tiamat (or Ocean), which are the exact
equivalents of the waters above and under the
firmament.'

'

' See below, p.
' According to

196 f.

Babylonian belief the upper waters of Tiamat
formed the heavenly ocean above the covering of heaven; but
it is not clear what became of her lower waters. It is possible
that they were vaguely identified with those of A p s ~ ,and were
believed to mingle with his around and beneath the earth. I t
may be suggested, however, that perhaps all or part of them were
identified with Hnbur, the River of the Underworld which was
believed to exist in the depths of the earth (cf. Jensen, Myihen,
p. 307). The fact that Tiamat bore the title Umrnu-Ejubur, "the
Mother Hubur," may be cited in support of this suggestion, as
well as the occurrence upon S. 2 , 0 1 3 (cf. p. 197) of the plirases
$amZ(e) ru-ku-u-li and Uu-hur pal-ka-if, corresponding to Ti'amat
L-li-fiand Ti.amat iap-li-h' respectively; see also p. xlvi, note.

(4)The creation
o,,,,,,,,d

of vegetation.

INTRODUCTION.

The third and fourth acts of creation, as narrated in
Gen. i, 9 - 13, are those of the earth and of vegetation.
Although no portion of the Babylonian poem has
yet been recoveredwhich contains the corresponding
account, it is probable that these acts of creation were
related on the Fifth Tablet of the series.' Berossus
expressly states that Be1 formed the earth out of one
half of Omorlta's body, and as his summary of the
Babylonian Creation story is proved to be correct
wherever it can be controlled, it is legitimate to
assume that he is correct in this detail also. Moreover, in three passages in the Seventh Tablet the
creation of the earth by Marduk is referred to : 1. I I 5
reads, " Since he created the heaven and fashioned
the firm earth" ; the new fragment K. I 2,830 (restored
from the commentary K. 8,299) states, " He named
the four quarters (of the world) " ; and another new
fragment; K. 13,761 (restored from the co~nmentary
K. 4,406), definitely ascribes to Marduk the title
"Creator of the earth."
That the creation of vegetation by Marduk was also recorded in the poem may
be concluded from the opening lines of the Seventh
Tablet, which are inscribed on the new fragment
K. 2,854, and (with restorations from the commentary
S. 1 1 , etc.) ascribe to him the titles " Bestower of

planting," " Founder of sowing," "Creator of grain
and plants," and add that he "caused the green herb
to spring up." '
T o the fifth act of creation, that of the heavenly (5)Theereation

bodies (Gen. i, 14- ~ g ) we
,
find an exceedingly close bodies.
parallel in the opening lines of the Fifth Tablet of the
series.= I n the Hebrew account, lights were created
in thefirmament of heaven to divide the day from the
night, and to be for signs, and for seasons, and for
days, and years. In the Babylonian poem also the
stars were created and the year was ordained at the
same time ; the twelve months were to be regulated
by the stars ; and the Moon-god was appointed " to
determine the days." As according to the Hebrew
account two great lights were created in the firmament
of heaven, the
light to rule the day and the
lesser to rule the night, so according to the Babylonian
poem the night was entrusted to the Moon-god, and
the Moon-god's relations to the Sun-god are described
in detail. On the Seventh Tablet, also, the creation
of heaven and the heavenly bodies is referred t o ; in
1. 16 Marduk is stated "to have established for the
gods the bright heavens," and 1. I I I f. read, " For
the stars of heaven he upheld the paths, he shepherded
all the gods like sheep !"

(6)Thecreation
of animals.

INTRODUCTION.

TO the sixth and seventh acts of creation, i.e.,
the creation of creatures of the sea and winged
fowl, and of beasts and cattle and creeping things
(Gen. i, 20-zs), the Babylonian poem as yet offers
no parallel, for the portion of the text which refers
to the creation of animals is still wanting. But since
Berossus states that animals were created at the
same time as man, it is probable that their creation
was recorded in a missing portion either of the Fifth
or of the Sixth Tablet. If the account was on the
lines suggested by Berossus, and animals shared in
the blood of Bd, it is clear that their creation was
narrated, as a subsidiary and less important episode,
after that of man.' But, although this episode is still
wanting in the poem, we find references on other
Assyrian Creation fragments to the creation of beasts.
Thus, for the creation of the creatures of the sea in
Genesis, we may compare the fragmentary text
K. 3445 + R. 396, which records the creation of
nu&+,
" dolphins (?)."
And for the creation of
beasts of the earth and cattle, we may compare the
tablet D.T. 4 1 , ~which, after referring generally to
the creation of "living creatures" by "the gods,"
proceeds to classify them as the cattle and beasts of
the field, and the creatures of the city, the two

classes referring respectively to wild and domesticated
animals.'
T h e account of the creation of man, which is $ ; f , k y t l a n
recorded as the eighth and last act of creation in
the Hebrew account (Gen. i, 26-31), at length finds
its parallel in the Babylonian poem upon the new
fragment of the Sixth Tablet, No. 92,629.' I t has
already been pointed out that the Babylonian account
closely follows the version of the story handed down
to us from Berossus,%nd it may here be added that
the employment by Marduk, the Creator, of his own
blood in the creation of man may perhaps be compared to the Hebrew account of the creation of man
in the image and after the likeness of E l ~ h i m . ~
Moreover, the use of the plural in the phrase " Let
us make man" in Gen. i, 26, may be compared with
the Babylonian narrative which relates that Marduk
imparted his purpose of forming man to his father Ea,

' The portion of the text on which this reference to the creation
of beasts is inscribed forms an introduction to what is probably
an incantation, and may be compared to the Creation legend of
Marduk and Aruru which is employed as an introduction to an
incantation to be recited in honour of the temple E-zida (see
below, p. 13of., n. I ) . T h e account given of the creation of the
beasts is merely incidental, and is introduced to indicate the period
of the creation by Nin-igi-azag of two small creatures, one white
and one black, which were probably again referred to in the following
section of the text.
See above, pp. liv if.
See below, pp. 86 ff.
See also below, p. xciii. It may be also noted that, according
to Babylonian belief, the great gods (cf. the plural of Elohim) were
always pictured in human form.

whom he probably afterwards instructed to carry out
the actual work of man's creation.'
(8) The
A parallel to the charge which, according to the
i n s f r ~ ~ t i ot o" ~
m a n a f t e r h i s Hebrew account, Elohim gave to man and woman
creation.
after their creation, has hitherto been believed to exist
on the tablet K. 3,364, which was supposed to contain
a list of the duties of man as delivered to him after his
creation by Marduk. T h e new Babylonian duplicate
of this text, No. 33,851, proves that K. 3,364 is not
part of the Creation Series, but is merely a tablet of
moral precepts, so that its suggested resemblance to
the Hebrew narrative must be given up. It is not
improbable, however, that a missing portion of the
Sixth Tablet did contain a short series of instructions
by Marduk to man, since man was created with the
special object of supplying the gods with worshippers
and building shrines in their honour. That to these
instructions to worship the gods was added the gift of
dominion over beasts, birds, and vegetation is possible,
but it must be pointed out that the Babylonian version
of man's creation is related from the point of view
of the gods, not from that of man. Although his
creation forms the culmination of Marduk's work, it
was conceived, not as an end and aim in itself, but
merely as an expedient to satisfy the discontented
gods.= This expedient is referred to in the Seventh

Tablet, 1. zg, in the phrase " For their forgiveness
(i.e., the forgiveness of the gods) did he create
mankind," and other passages in the Seventh Tablet
tend to show that Mardulr's mercy and goodness are
extolled in his relations, not to mankind, but to the
gods.' In one passage' man's creation is referred to,

not the deeds of his Creator.'

to be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.'
('.)Theword
A suggestion has been made that the prominence
of the Creator.
given to the word of the Creator in the Hebrew
account may have found its parallel in the creation by
a word in the Babylonian poem. It is true that the
word of Marduk had magical power and could destroy
and create alike; but Marduk did not employ his
word in any of his acts of creation which are at present
known to us. H e first conceived a cunning device,
and then proceeded to carry it out by hand. T h e
only occasion on which he did employ his word to
destroy and to create is in the Fourth Tablet, 11. 19-26,2
when, at the invitation of the gods, he tested his power
by making a garment disappear and then appear again
at the word of his mouth. The parallelism between
the two accounts under this heading is not very close.
The order of the separate acts of creation is also not
(XI) TI,^ order
of Creation.
quite the same in the two accounts, for, while in the
Babylonian poem the heavenly bodies are created
immediately after the formation of the firmament, in
the Hebrew account their creation is postponed until
after the earth and vegetation have been made. It is
~ossiblethat the creation of the earth and plants has
been displaced by the writer to whom the present
form of the Hebrew account is due, and that the
T h e new parallel to Gen. ii, z j , furnished by 1. 5 of the Sixth
Tablet, is referred to below, p. xciv.
a See below, p. 60 f.

order of creation was precisely the same in the original
forms of the two narratives. But even according to the
present arrangement of the Hebrew account, there
are several striking points of resemblance to the
Babylonian poem. These may be seen in the existence
of light before the creation of the heavenly bodies ;
in the dividing of the waters of the primeval flood by
means of a firmament also before the creation of the
heavenly bodies ; and in the culminating act of creation
being that of man.
It would be tempting to trace the framework of the (Days
12) The Seven
and the
Seven Days of Creation, upon which the narrative Seven
Tablets
of Crzatlon.
in Genesis is stretched, to the influence of the Seven
Tablets of Creation, of which we now know that the
great Creation Series was composed. The reasons for
the employment of the Seven Days in the Hebrew
account are, however, not the same which led to the
arrangement of the Babylonian poem upon Seven
Tablets. In the one the writer's intention is to give the
original authority for the observance of the Sabbath; in
the other there appears to have been no special reason
for this arrangement of the poem beyond the mystical
nature of the number "seven." Moreover, acts of
creation are recorded on all of the first six Days in the
Hebrew narrative, while in the Babylonian poem the
creation only begins at the end of the Fourth Tablet.'
The resemblance, therefore, is somewhat superficial, but

' There

is, however, a parallel between the Seventh Day on

XCII

The Seven
Days and the
Seven Tablets
of Creation.

INTRODUCTION.

it is possible that the employment of the number "seven"
in the two accounts was not fortuitous. Whether the
Sabbath was of Babylonian origin (as seems probable)
or not, it is clear that the writer of the narrative in
Genesis was keenly interested in its propagation and
its due observance. Now in Exilic and post-Exilic times
the account of the Creation most prevalent in Babylonia
was that in the poem E n u m a edir, the text of which
was at this time absolutely fixed and its arrangement
upon Seven Tablets invariable. That the late revival
of mythology among the Jews was partly due to their
actual study of the Babylonian legends at this period is
sufficiently proved by the minute points of resemblance
between the accounts of the Deluge in Genesis and
in the poem of Gilgamesh.' It is probable, therefore,
that the writer who was responsible for the final
form of Gen. i - ii, 4a, was familiar with the Babylonian
legend of Creation in the form in which it has come
down to us. The supposition, then, is perhaps not too
which Elohim rested from all H i s work, and the Sevenlh Tablet
which records t h e hymns of praise sung by the gods to Mardulr
after his work of creation was ended.
' See my Ba6ylonian Religion nndMylhology, pp. 138 ff. T h e fact
that the Jews of theExile were probably familiar with the later forms
of Babylonian legends explains some of the close resemblances
in detail between the Babylonian and Hebrew versions of the same
story. But this is in perfect accordance with the borrowing of
that very story by t h e Hebrews many centuries before; indeed, t o
t h e previous existence of ancient Hebrew versions of Babylonian
legends may be traced much of the impetus given to the revival
of mythology among the exiled Jews.

formed from the dust of the ground, which may be
compared to the mixing of Bel's blood with earth
according to the account of Berossus, the use of the
Creator's blood in the one account being paralleled by
the employment of His breath in the other for the
purpose of giving life to the dust or earth. Earth is
not mentioned in the recovered portion of the Sixth
Tablet, but its use in the creation of men is fully in
accordance with Babylonian beliefs. Thus, according
to the second Babylonian account of the Creation,'
Marduk formed man by pouring out dust beside a
reed which he had set upon the face of the waters.
Clay is also related to have been employed in the
creation of special men and heroes ; thus it was used

INTRODUCTION.

Sixth Tablet of the Creation Series, in the use of
the word igimtu, bone," corresponding to the
Hebrew '@!ern which occurs in the phrase "bone of
my bones" in Gen. ii, 23.
In addition to the Babylonian colouring of much
of the story of Paradise we may now add a new
parallel from the Babylonian address to a mythical
River of Creation, inscribed on S. 1704 and the NeoBabylonian Tablet 82 - 9 - 18, 5311.l This short
composition is addressed to a River to whom the
creation of all things is ascribed,%and with this river
we may compare the mythical river of Paradise
which watered the garden, and on leaving it was
divided into four branches. That the Hebrew River
of Paradise is Babylonian in character is clear ; and
the origin of the Babylonian River of Creation is
also to be found in the Euphrates, from whose waters
southern Babylonia derived its great f e r t i l i t ~ . ~T h e

' See below, p.

1 2 8 f.
With the Babylonian River of Creation, suggested by the
Euphrates, we may compare the Egyptian beliefs concerning H i p
or Hipi, the god of the Nile, who became identified with most
of the great primeval Creation gods and was declared to he the
Creator of all things. Considering the importance of the Nile
for Egypt, it is easy to understand how he came to attain this
position. Brugsch sums up his account of this deity in the words :
" So ist der Nilgott im letzten Grunde der geheimnissvolle Urheher
" aller Wohlthaten, welche dievon ihm befruchtete agyptische Erde
" den Gottern und Menschen zu hieten vermag, er ist 'der starke
" Schopfer von allem ' " ; see Relkion und Myihologie der alien
Aegypter, p. 641.
It is possihle that this River, though suggested by the

life-giving stream of Paradise is met with elsewhere
in the Old Testament, as, for instance, in Ezekiel
xlvii, and it is probable that we may trace its
influence in the Apocalypse.'
I t is unnecessary here to discuss in detail the p r o b a ~ e d a t e s
of Rnbylonlrn
evidence to prove that the Hebrew narratives of the lnAuence on
Hebrew
Creation were ultimately derived from Babylonia, and myt~lo~ogy.
were not inherited independently by the Babylonians
and Hebrews from a common Semitic ancestor.' For
the local Babylonian colouring of the stories, and
the great age to which their existence can be traced,
extending back to the time of the Sumerian inhabitants
are conclusive evidence against the
of Mes~potamia,~
second alternative. On the other hand, it is equally
unnecessary to cite the well-known arguments to prove
Euphrates, is to be identified with Hudur, the River of the Underworld, to whom an incantation in the terms of the one under
discussion might well have been addressed. A connection
between Tiamat and the river Fubur has been suggested above
(cf. p. Ixxxiii, n. z), and, should this prove to be correct, we might
see in the phrase banat(at) ha-la-nia, applied to the River, a parallel
to pa-ti-ka-a/ ka-la-ma, the description of Ummu-Hubur (Tiamat)
in Tablet I, 1. I r 3 aad the parallel passages.
' The connection which Gunkel and Zimmern would trace
between the River of Paradise and the River of Water of Life in
the Apocalypse on the one side and the " water of life," mentioned
in the legend of Adapa, on the other, cannot he regarded as
proved. The resemblance in the expressions may well be
fortuitous, since there are few other points of resemblance between
the narratives in which the expressions occur.

INTRODUCTION.

the existence among the Hebrews of Creation legends
similar to those of Babylonia for centuries before the
Exile. T h e allusions to variant Hebrew forms of the
Babylonian Dragon-Myth in Amos ix, 3, Isaiah li, 9,
Psalm Ixxiv, 13 f., and lxxxix, 9 f., and Job xxvi, I 2 f.,
and ix, 13, may be cited as sufficient proof of the early
period at which the borrowing from Babylonian sources
must have taken place ; .and the striking differences
between the Biblical and the linown Babyloniall versions
of the legends prove that the Exilic and post-Exilic Jews
must have found ready to their hand ancient Hebrew
versions of the stories, and that the changes they
introduced must in the main have been confined to
details of arrangement and to omissions necessitated by
their own more spiritual conceptions and beliefs. T h e
discovery of the Tell el-Amarna tablets proved conclusively that Babylonian influence extended throughout Egypt and Western Asia in the fifteenth century
B.c., and the existence of legends among the letters
demonstrated the fact that Babylonian niythology
exerted an influence coextensive with the range of
her political ties and interests. W e may therefore conjecture that Babylonian myths had become naturalized
in Palestine before the conquest of that country by
the Israelites. Many such Palestinian versions of
Babylonian myths the Israelites no doubt absorbed;
while during the subsequent period of the Hebrew liings
Assyria and Babylonia exerted a direct influence upon
them. It is clear, therefore, that at the time of their

tablets, on the other hand, are, as
a rule, less carefully written ; they vary considerably
in size and shape, and were made at different periods
for private individuals, either for their own use,' or
that they might be deposited in the te~nples as
votive offerings2 Some of these Babylonian copies
an Assyrian archetype (gab-n' '"""'AA;iurX'). Upon some tablets
Ashur-bani-pal's label was scratched after the tablet had been
baked, e.g., K. 3.567
I<. 8,588 (Czin. Texts, pt. xiii, pl. 22).
Other Assyrian copies, though giving the catch-line to the next
tablet, are without colophons, e.g., I<.3.473, etc. (cf. Czin. Texfs,
pt. xiii, pl. g ) , and I<. 8,526 (cf. Cun. Texts, pt. xiii, pl. 23) ; the copy
of the last tablet, K. 2,854 (see below, p. rgq), the reverse of which
is blank, was probably also without a colophon.
' Cf. No. 40,559 (vol. ii, pl. xxi), a copy of the Second Tablet
which was niade for a certain Nahi-abti-iddina; and No. 45,528+
46,614 (vol. ii, pl. vi), a copy of the First Tablet, mhich is described
as the property of Nahi-mcshetik-urri, a worshipper of Marduli and
Sarpanitu, and is said to have been copied from an original at
Babylon on the ninth day of Ipyar, in the twenty-seventh year of
Darius. A certain Nabu-balitsn-ikbi, the son of Na'id-Marduk,
appears to have owned a complete set of the Seven Creation
Tablets, for we possess fragments of the First and of the Sixth
Tablet in the series which belonged to him (cf. No. 93,ors,
Cun. Texts, pl. j , where the first word of the second line of the
colophon, which puzzled Delitzsch, is clearly 6z~;zi; No. 46,803,

' Thus the fine copy of the Fourth Tablet, No. 93,016, which
was written by the scribe Nabu-btilishu, was, according to its
colophon (cf. Cun. Texfs, pt. xiii, pl. 1 5 ) . deposited by the smith
Na'id-Marduk as a votive offering in the temple E-zida. I n his
transliteration of this colophon Delitzsch has made an odd blunder;
he has not recognized the common phrase ana d n i a nnp&itL'*-s'u,

INTRODUCTION.

whether Assyrian or h'eo-Babylonian, is that the text
is never written in columns, but each line of the poem
is written across the tablet from edg-e to edge.' As
a result, the tablets are long and narrow in shape,
and are handled far more conveniently than broader
tablets inscribed with two or more columns of writing
on each side.
The forms of the text of the poem, which were in
use in the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, are
identical, and it is incorrect to spealc of an Assyrian
and a Babylonian "recension."
At the time of
Ashur-bani-pal the text had already been definitely
fixed, and, with the exception of one or two phrases,
the words of each line remained unchanged from that
time forward. It is true that on the Babylonian
tablets the words are, as a rule, written more
syllabically, but this is a general characteristic of
Babylonian copies of historical and literary texts.
Moreover, upon several of the more carefully written
tablets, the metre is indicated by the division of thc

+

1,403 6,361 (No. zz) and 93,051 (No. 32). I n the other class
short extracts from the text are inscribed upon tablets containing
other matter, all of which the pupil has written out for practice;
cf. Nos. 36.726 (No. 5), 36,688 (No. q ) , 8z-9-18, 6,gjo + 83-1-18,
1,868 (No. z4).and82-9-18,5,448
83-1-18, 2,116 (No. 27). T h e
second class are the more carelessly written of the two.

+

' T h e only apparent exceptions to this rule occur on some of the
Neo-Babylonian tablets,inwhich two lines of the text areoccasionally
written on one line of the tablet when they are separated from each
other by a division-mark. This is simply due to want of space,
which necessitated the crowding of the text.

halves of each verse,' an arrangement which is not
met with on any of the Assyrian tablets. But both
the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian copies represent the
same " recension" of the text, and, as has already
been indicated,= are probably the descendants of
a common Babylonian original. The following table

Commentaries
to the Seventh
Tablet.

In the arrangement and interpretation of the
text of the Seventh Tablet we receive considerable
assistance from some fragments of Assyrian commentaries which have come down to us. These were
compiled by the Assyrian scribes in order to explain
that composition, and they are of the greatest value
for the study of the text. T h e contents of these
docaments, and their relation to the text of the Seventh

CXVII

Tablet, are described in detail in Appendix I,' but the
following
- facts with regard to the size of the tablets
inscribed with the commentaries, and to previous
publications of portions of them, may here be conveniently given.
T h e most important class of commentary takes ,,the
t,,,,,c
of the first
form of a bilingual list, and, as has been pointed out CI-S.
elsewhere,= presupposes the existence of a Sumerian
version of part of the text of the Seventh Tablet of
the Creation Series. T h e text of the commentary is
inscribed in a series of double columns ; in the left
half of each column it gives a list of the Sumerian
words, or ideograms, and, in the right half, opposite
each word is added its Assyrian equivalent. It is
noteworthy that the list is generally arranged in the
order in which the words occur in the Assyrian text
of the Seventh Tablet. The colun~nsof the cammentarv are divided into a number of compartments,
or sections, by horizontal lines impressed upon the
clay, and the words within each compartment
refer either to separate couplets, or to separate lines,
of the Seventh Tablet. Of this class of commentary
we possess six fragments of two large tablets which
were inscribed with five or six double columns of
writing on each side; the two tablets are duplicates
of one another, having been inscribed with the same

extracts enumerated on pp. xcvii ff. ; while several
passages in the Seventh Tablet have been conjecturally restored from the Assyrian Co~ninentaries
just described.
In the reconstruction of the text
preference has usually been given to the readings
found upon the Assyrian tablets, and the variant
readings of all duplicates, both Assyrian and NeoBabylonian, are given in the notes at the foot of the
page. T h e lines upon each tablet of the Series have
been numbered, and, where the numbering of a line is
conjectural, it is placed within parentheses. Great
assistatice in the numbering of the lines of detached
fragments of the text has been afforded by the fact
that upon many of t h e Neo-Babylonian copies every
tenth line is marked with a figure " 1 0 " in the lefthand margin ; in but few instances can the position of
a detached fragment be accurately ascerrained by its
shape. T h e lines upon the Second and Fifth Tablets
have been conjecturally numbered up to one hundred
and forty. Upon the Sixth Tablet the total number
of lines was one hundred and thirty-six or one hundred
and forty-six ; and, in view of the fact that the scribe
of No. 92,629 has continued the text to the bottom of

there are still considerable gaps in the text of several
of the Tablets. T h e only Tablets in which the whole

and Fourth of the Series. Gaps, where the text is
completely wanting, occur in Tablet I, 11. 68-82, and
in Tablet 11, 11. 59-(68)' T h e greater part of the
text of Tablet V is wanting, hut by roughly estimating
the position of the fragment K. 3,449a, which occurs
about in the centre of the text, we obtain two
gaps, between 11. 26 and (66) and between 11. (87) and

or duplicate, the division has, as far as possible,
been retained in the transliteration of the text. I n
accordance with the rules of Babylonian poetry, the
text generally falls into couplets, the second verse
frequently echoing or supplementing the first ; each of
the two verses of a couplet is divided into halves, and
each half-verse may be further subdivided by an
accented syllable.2 This four-fold division of each

For the first description of the metre of the poem, see Budge,
P.S.R.A., vol. vi, p. 7 ; and for later discussions of the metre of
Babylonian poetry in general, see Zimmern's papers in the Zeits.
fCr Asgyr., viii, pp. rzI ff., x, pp. I ff., xi, pp. 86 ff., and xii,
pp. 382 ff.; cf. also D. M. Mueller, Die Propheten in ihrer ursprl2ngIichen Fom, i, pp. 5 ff. I t may be noted that in addition to
the division of the text into couplets, the poem often falls
naturally into stanzas of four lines each. That the metre was
not very carefully studied by the Neo-Babylonian scribes is
proved by the somewhat faulty division of the verses upon some
of the tablets on which the metre is indicated, and also by the
fact that the pupils of the scribes were allowed, and perhaps told,
to write out portions of the poem in sections, not of four, but of
five lines each (see above, p. c x i ~ f.,
i n. 4).

It will be seen that the second verse of each couplet
balances the first, and the caesura, or division, in the
centre of each verse is well marked. The second half
of verse 3 and the first half of verse 5, each of which
contains only one word, may appear rather short for
scansion, but the rhythm is retained by dwelling on
the first part of the word and treating the suffix almost
as an independent word. It is unnecessary to transliterate more of the text of the poem in this manner,
as the simple metre, or rather rhythm, can be
detected without difficulty from the syllabic transliteration which is given in the following pages.

T h e first sign of the word in No. 4 5 , 5 2 8 , etc., is probably t a ;
the restoration of the second half of the line as ki-ri[6] ;[a-ma-mi],
"in the midst of heaven," is therefore possible. T h e existence
of &Zmdmu, or "heaven," so early in the Creation-story is not
inconsistent with Marduk's subsequent acts of creation. After
slaying Tiamat his first act was to use half of her body as
a covering for the ;amZmu (cf. Tabl. IV, 1. 138, :a-ma ma
u-!a-al-lil); it is therefore clear that the ;am~mu was vaguely
conceived as already in existence.

' This passage is very broken, but the sign is possibly ' ; it is
probably not ma, as Jensen suggests. I n the folloiving line ihc
reading of s'[u]p-{u-Ea-at upon 81-7-27, 80 is certain; and the
precatives are to he taken as in the z m. s., not the 3 f. s. T h e
parallelism of this passage with I. 38, moreover, proves that mziil-Sit
is to be rendered " b y night," not "liire the night"; and the
expression cannot therefore he cited as proving that it was the
creation of light which caused the revolt of Apsi~. For a further
discussion of this point and of the suggested reading of in2 ma

T h e last sign of the line preserved by 81-7-27, 80 is either

' T h e reading [6]a-[j.]tiis not quite certain ; there are traces of
only two signs.
T h e word meku occurs again in Tablet 11, I. 8 1 (rite-ku-z‘i:
Ti-a-ma-fi), and Tablet IV, 1. 66 ({a "'Ki~-gzr . . . .
me-ki-{u), and from the context of these passages it is clear that
the word describes an act or state capable of inspiring terror.
I 1 R, pl. 36, No. 3, Obv., 1. 49 f., explains the group [II]A-SAL as
me-ku-u ;a KA (i.e. pzl or Jinnr~),and a following group as " ditto "
(i.e. me-ku-u) ba amiii. If we may connect this me ilr~-u with
tire meku in the passages quoted above, we may perhaps assign to
it some such meaning as "muttering, growling, snarling.'' I t is
probable that Apsii. Mumrnu, and Icingu, as well as Tiamat, were
conceived as monsters and not endowed with human forms.

T h e word should probably be restored as tzi.ri[z'],or tir-ri-[ma].
T h e first half of the line may possibly he restored as [zs-me-ma
Ti-amat], as suggested in the translation; or [ib-du-ma Ti-amat
a-nu], cf. Tablet 11, I. (113). According to this interpretation the
speech of the god (Icingu) ends with 1. 104, Tiamat replies in
I. 106, and with I. 107 the narrative begins the description of
Tiamat's preparations for battle. I t is possible that the speech
does not end with I. 104, but continues to 1. 106; in that case
I. 106 may be restored in some such way a s "[The leadership of
the gods unto me] shalt thou entrust," and for a-[mla-turn in
1. '05 we should perhaps read a-[bla-turn. T h e former interpretation seems to me preferable, as it assigns a line to Tiamat in
which she assents to Kingu's proposals.

Conjectural restoration.
For this restoration cf. Tablet I, 1. 103.
T h e sign is possibly ta.

T h e beginning
may perhaps be restored as [pu-ufi-ru-ujd; in that case a passive
meaning must be assigned to 7)-tn-Sar, and the line translated,
"How she had collected her [forces] unto Ea was divulged."

I n the parallel passage, Tablet 111, 1. roq, No. 93,017 reads at
the end of the line '"'A-nun-na-hi. This is in favour of Jensen's
suggestion that the present passage should be restored as '"'E-nu]uh-hi; cf. the list of gods, K. 2,100 (published by Beaold, P.S.B.A.,
"01. xi, March, I 889), col. iv, 1. 8, which explains ""E-nu-uk-hi as

"'A-nun-na-[hi].
Conjectural restoration.
For the first half of the line Delitzsch suggests the restoration
siinju linhastna, " he smote his loins."

42. " ' [May they magnify thy name over all of
them .

43. " [She hath given him the Tablets of Destiny, on
his breast she] laid them, (saying) :
44. " '[Thy command shall not be without avail], and
the [word] of thy mouth shall be established.'
45. " [Now Kingu, (thus) exalted], having received
the power of Anu,
46. " Decreed the fate [for the gods, her sons],
(saying) :
47. " ' Let [the opening of your mouth] quench the
Fire-god ;
48. " ' [Whoso is exalted in the battle], let him display
(his) might ! ' "
49. [When An5ar heard how Tiamatl2 was mightily

The reading bat is certain.
ta-nu-ra I take as the Pret., not the Pres. From 11. 93 ff. of the
First Tablet it may be inferred that ApsI3 was conquered before
Tiamat made her preparations for battle. I t is clear, therefore, that
in the present passage fa-nu-ra is to be taken as the Pret. and not
as the Pres. ; and, as AnSar is addressing Ea, it may be concluded
that E a was the conqueror of Apsi~. In accordance with this conclusion is the fact that it was the god E a who first discovered the
conspiracy of Apsi~and Tiamat (see Tablet I, I. 60).

gods to Marduk, alter he had taken his seat in their presence.

TI-IE DEATH OF

TIAMAT.

71

When Tiamat heard these words,
She was like one possessed, she lost her reason.
Tiamat uttered wild, piercing cries,
She trembled and shook to her very foundations.
She recited an incantation, she pronounced her
spell,
92. And the gods of the battle cried out for their
weapons.
93. Then advanced Tiamat and Marduk, the counsellor
of the gods ;
94. T o the fight they came on, to the battle they drew
nigh.
95. The lord spread out his net and caught her,
96. And the evil wind that was behind (him) he let
loose in her face.
97. As Tiamat opened her mouth to its full extent,
98. H e drove it1 the evil wind, while as yet she had
not shut her lips.
99. T h e terrible winds filled her belly,
loo. And her courage was talien from her, and her
mouth she opened wide.
I O I . H e seized the spear and burst her belly,
102. H e severed her inward parts, he pierced (her)
heart.
103. H e overcame her and cut off her life ;

" t o determine six days," agrees well with 1. 1 3 , where Marduk is
described as appointing the Moon-god a-nu ud-du-u u-me, < ' t o

followed in I. 17 by the statement of the Moon-god's duty on the
seventh day.

I n the speech that follows it may be conjectured that the gods
complained that, although Marduk had endowed the heavens with
splendour and had caused plants to live upon the earth, yet there
were no shrines built in honour of the gods, and there were no
worshippers devoted to their service; see below, p. 88, notc I .

Conjectural restoration.
I t is possible that the final vowel of da-mi is not the i of the
I sing. pron. suffix; in that case the phrase should be translated
"Blood will I take." I n view of the fact, however, that, according
to Berossus, BE1 first formed mankind from his own blood mixed with
earth, it appears to me preferable to take the i as the pron. suffix
and translate da-mi as " my blood!'
Berossus does not state that
BBI used his own hone for forming man, and this agrees with the
a

I will create man who shall inhabit [the earth],1o

absence of thepronominal suffix from i?-si-irn-[tulm. According
to my rendering of the line, Mardulr states his purpose of forming
man from his own blood, and from bone which he will create; see
further, the Introduction.
T h e traces of the last sign of the word appear to be those of
turn. I think there can be no doubt that is-$i-rjn-[tu]mcorresponds
to the Hebrew ' e ~ e r n ,"bone," which is employed in Gcn. ii, 23, in
the phrase 'esern m?'b;6rnui, "bone of my bones." I n connection
with the feminine form of the word 4-scim-[tulrn, it may be noted
that, in addition to the plnr. 'iigimim, the fem. form 'd~dmbthis also
found.
T h e verb may perhaps be restored as lu-[ub-nil, as suggested
in the translation.
lo The last word of the line may perhaps be restored as ir:ilLjiz,
as suggested in the translation.

T h e word is probably papahu: literally the line reads, "Let
the service of the gods be established, and as for them let [their]
shrines [be built]."
I t is interesting to note the reason that is
here implied for the creation of mankind, i.e., that the gods may
have worshippers. There is clearly a reference to this in 1. 29 of
the Seventh Tablet, where, after referring to Marduk's mercy upon
the gods, his enemies, the text goes on a-nu pa-di-iu-nu i6-nu-u
a-me-lu-fu, " F o r their forgiveness did he create mankind."
a I t is probable that the end of the line contained some
expression parallel to al-ha-kn-ti.
I t seems to me preferable to assign to the Pie1 of [kaiiZlu] its
usual meaning " t o oppress," rather than to rcnder the passage as

That the service of the gods may be established,
and that [their] shrines ' [may be built].

T h e sense seems to b e that

Marduk, by the creation of man, will establish the worship of the
gods, but at the same time will punish the gods for their complaints.
I t is possible that in his speech that follows Ea dissuades hlarduk
from carrying out the second part of his proposal.
The signs at the beginning of the line are not very clear.
T h e signs read as ut, SaZ, and &I are probably not to be taken as

' I t is probable that the missing portion of the text corresponded
closely with the account of the creation of man and animals given
by Berossns; for a further discussion of this subject, see the
Introduction. T h e tablet K. 3 , 3 6 4 [Cun. Texts, part xiii, pl. 2 9 f.)
has been thought to belong to the Creation Series, and to contain
the instructions given by Marduk to man after his creation. Had
this been so, it would have formed part of the Sixth Tablet. On
plates lxivff. of Vol. I1 is published the text of a Neo-Babylonian
tablet, No. 33,851, which gives a duplicate text to K. 3 , 3 6 4 ; and
in Appendix I1 I have given reasons for believing that the text
inscribed upon K. 3 , 3 6 4 and No. 33,851 has no connection with

THE LAST ASSEMBLY OF THE GODS.

the Creation Series, but is part of a long composition containing
moral precepts. Another fragment which it has been suggested
belongs to one of the later tablets of the Creation Series is
K. 3,445 R. 396 (Cun. Texts, part xiii, pl. zq f. ; cf. also its
duplicate K. 14,949.pl. 24) ; but there are strong reasons against
the identification of the text as a fragment of the series Enuma
eliJ, though it may well be part of a parallel version of the Creation
story (see further, Appendix 11).
T h e address of the gods to Marduk forms the subject of the
Seventh Tablet of the series.

T h e reading of K. 9,267, I think, is Sat rather than &.
T h e end of this line may perhaps he restored from R. 2,107,
etc., col. ii, 1. 30 (see pl. lxii and Appendix I), as nu-si-@;a-bu-ti,
"who destroyed the mighty!'
This does not appear to agree with 11. 2 5 and 33, but the
reading of K. 9,267 is clear.
T h e sign following nu is broken, but the reading si$ is possible.
O n K. 2,107, etc., col. ii, 1. 3 1 the title Sub-liur is explained as
mu-baf-lu-uai-bi, and, though the following lines give explanations
of other titles, they contain the synonymous expressions nzu-bal-lu-u

' That the fragments I<. 8,519 and K. I 3,337 belong to two
copies of the Seventh Tablet is proved by their correspondence
with the commentary K. 4,406, Rev., col. ii (pl. livf.).
This is clear from the fact that col. i of the reverse of
K. 4,406 gives the coinirrcntary to the earlier lines preserved by
the preceding fragment, I<. 13,761. T h e three columns of the
commentary, parts of which are preserved on one side of K. 4,406,
are probably cols. i, ii, and iii of the reverse of the tablet; if this
is so, it follows that the lines on I<. 8,519 and I<. 13,337 follow
those on K. 13,761. But, as it is possible that I<. 4,406 gives the
last three columns of the obverse of the tablet, a conjectural
numbering of the lines of the text has not been attempted.
With the phrase [ . . . . n]ap.har be-l<~n,compare the
explanations of a title of Marduk given by K. 2,107 K. 6,086

T h e kaspu is the space that can be covered in two hours

second measurement in the line is taken by Zimmern to refer to
the dragon's breadth, but, as Jensen points out, this is not
consistent with the measurement of the mouth given in the
following line. Even Zimmern's readings of bo GAR in 1. 1 0 and
65 GAR in 1. 1 1 do not explain, but render still more anomaloos,
the & GAR in I. 9. Without going into the question of the probable
length of the Babylonian cubit, it is obvious that the dragon's
breadth can hardly have been given as so many miles, if its mouth
only measures so many feet. This difliculty can be got over by
restoring ;ri~zififuin place of the suggested rz~$r*ssu at the end of
I. 8. We then have a consistent picture of the dragon as a long
thin snake, rearing his head on high; his coils might well have
been believed to extend for three hundred or three hundred and
fifty miles, and the raising of his head in the air to a height of six
or seven miles would not be inconsistent with the measurement of
his mouth as six cubits, i.e., some ten feet or more across.

' Jensen suggests the restoration '&'B[U],which he deduces
from the traces upon the tablet as published by Delitzsch ; for, as
he states, the only other restoration possible would he " ' I [ I f a r ] ,
and this is rendered unlikely by the masculine form of the
imperatives in 11. 2 and 4. This would prove that the slayer of
the dragon was B d , or Marduk, in both the versions of the story.
As a matter of fact, the traces are incorrectly given by Delitzsch ;
they represent the sign AN and not the conflate sign AN EN
(cf. Cun. Tzts., pt. xiii, pl. 34), and it is not possible to conclude
from the text who is the hero of this version.

"twenty hours," a not
only be the number " 10," i.e. X US-PU,
very probable reading. T h e diagonal wedge is more probably the
beginning of the sign MI, i.e. nzGSu, and the end of the line may be
restored as umu IKAN

day and one night," or possibly, as Zimmern in his translation
suggests, "day and night."
Line 9 is the last line of the text. T h e lower part of the
tablet is taken up with the common colophon found upon tablets
from ABnr-bani-pal's palace.

which may he rendered "version!'
Lines 8-14 are not, however,
a literal translation of 11. 1-7, though they appear to have been
taken from a somewhat similar Babylonian text. It is clear that
the extracts formed the opening lines of the compositions to
which they belonged, and that the scribe has written them out for
comparison, adding notes on some of the expressions which occur.
That both the Sumerian and Babylonian extracts are to be
taken as single sentences, and not broken up into separate phrases,
is proved by the note in 1. 1 5 . Here the scrihe equates LID with
e-nu-ma, and to e-nu-ma adds the grammatical note is'-tu Su-fa-mu-zr
mal-ma-ld, " corresponding to ir~tama.''

This mystical river of creation was evidently suggested by the
Euphrates, on the waters of which the fertility of Babylonia so
largely depended; for a comparison of similar conceptions of
a river of creation both in Egyptian and in Hebrew mythology,
see the Introduction. T h e text forms the opening words of an
incantation and is taken from the reverse of S. 1 , 7 0 4 , with
restorations and variant readings from the obverse of 82-9-18,
5 . 3 1 1 (cf. Appendix 11). A translation of the former tablet has
been given by Sayce, Hi6bert Lectures, p. 403.

containing the personal petitions of the suppliant (cf. Appendix 11).

' T h e text is taken from the tablet K. 5 , 4 1 8 ~and its duplicate
K. 5,460 (see Cunez@om Texts, part xiii, pls. 39-+I). T h e legend
was for some years known as " t h e Cuthaean legend of the
Creation." It was thought that the text was put in the mouth of
the god Nergal, who was supposed t u be waging war against the
brood of Tiamat; and it was assumed that Nergal took the place
of Marduk in accordance with local tradition at Cuthah. I t is
clear, however, that the speaker is not the god Nergal, but an old
Babylonian king, who recounts how the gods delivered him and
his land from hordes of monsters. I n the description of the
monsters in col. i, Tiamat i s said to have suckled them, but this
reference does not justify their identification with the monster
brood of the Creation Series ; it is more probable that Tiamat is
~ a l l e dtheir foster-mother in order to indicate their terrible nature.

T h e exclamatory phrase lu-u a-nu-ku-nza may perhaps be best

' T h e sign is AT, not T U R ; in other signs the scribe tends to

T h e word lu-ud-di evidently refers to a weapon of some kind.
I t was pointed out by Zimmern (Z.A., p. 317f.) that another
version of this portion of the legend is preserved on a fragment of
an Old-Babylonian tablet, the text of which is published in NeoAssyrian characters by Scheil, Recueil de frauaux, xx, p. 65 f.
According to Scheil, the fragment in question forms the third or
fourth column of a tablet, and in 1. 8 he read the name of the king
Tukulti-hel-nisi ; hut its parallelism with 1. 2 2 f. of col. ii of the
"Cuthaean Legend," as Zimmern pointed out, disproved the
reading, and in place of Scheil's IZ-KU-fi
[i.e. fukuNi(fi)1, a-ka-p'
[or a d ] , and a-nu-ar in 1. 8 f. we may probably read zisi-hu, a-ka-la,
and a-na-hi (cf. also Jensen's transliteration and translation of the
text in K.B., vi, pp. 298 ff.). T h e column of text preserved by the
fragment reads as follows : ( I ) lin-ta-&-a? fa-ap-da-a u-uZ i-zi[

the summary in 1. 6, the last line of the preceding column may
probably he restored, as " T h e first time, one hundrcd and eighty
thousand warriors I sent forth." Jensen also connects the fragment
K. 8,582 (see Haupt, Nimrodepos, p. 78) with the " Cuthaean

and capture of twelve ~ a r r i o r s and

' T h e fragments of the tablet K. 5,418a are not quite correctly
put together, the beginnings of 11. 9ff. being one line higher on
the tablet than the ends of the lines to which they correspond.
a I t would seem that one of the gods urged the king to make
offerings and supplication at the Feast of the New Year, before
undertaking his fourth expedition. From 11. 14ff. it is clear that
the king followed the god's advice ; and, from the conclusion of
col. iv, it may be inferred that he at last met with success against
his enemies.

Possibly the 2nd pers. plur., "ye commanded a n d " ; but as
the god appears to be addressing the king, the rendering in the
translation is preferable.
The end of the sign ICES is preserved.
a See above, p. 145, n. 7.
I t is clear that in the missing portion of the column the king
describes the defeat of his foes, since in col. iv he refers to the
record of his history as an encouragement to future princes who
may succeed him on the throne.

translation that the text does not contain a legend of creation
(cf. p. 140 f., note I). T h e reference to Tiamat in col. i, however,
is of considerable interest from the evidence which it furnishes
with regard to the early date of the dragon-myth; see further, the
Introduction.

@ssgrian Commenfaries anb @araffef Ze,tfs fo tlje
Sevenftj Ca6fef of f4e Creation 3eriee+
THESeventh Tablet of the Creation Series was a composition
which received much attention from the Babylonian and
Assyrian scribes, and specimens of three classes of commentaries have come down to us, which were compiled to
explain the whole, or portions, of its contents. The first and
most important class consists of a commentary to each line
of the text ; and of this class we have a single version
inscribed upon fragments of two large tablets, duplicates of
one another. A second class seems to have contained a kind
of running commentary to passages selected not only from
the Seventh Tablet, but also from the other tablets of the
Creation Series ; the fragment S. 747 belongs to this class of
explanatory text. A third class, represented by K. 2,107 +
K. 6,086, gives explanations of a number of titles of the god
Marduk, several of which occur in those portions of the text
of the Seventh Tablet which have been recovered. The
greate; part of this Appendix deals with these commentaries,
and with the information which they supply concerning
the contents and interpretation of the Seventh Tablet. A t
the end of the Appendix some fragments of texts are
discussed, which bear a striking resemblance to the Seventh
Tablet, and prove that the religious literature of Babylonia
included parallel texts composed on very similar lines. The
evidence which the commentaries and the fragments of parallel
texts furnish, with regard to the form and literary development
of the Creation Series, is also of considerable value.
T o the commentary of the first class, which refers to every
line of the Seventh Tablet, the following fragments belong:

+
+

+

S. I I + S. 980 S. 1,416, K. 4,406, 82-3-23, 15 I , R. 366
80-7- 19, 288 293, I<. 2,053, and K. 8,299 These six
fragments are separate portions of two large tablets, which
were inscribed with duplicate texts. I think there is little
doubt that S. 11 + S. 980 + S. 1,416 (vol. ii, pls. li ff. and lv)
and K. 4,406 (pl. livf.) are parts of the same tablet, a large
one inscribed with five or six double columns of writing on
each side; 82-3-23, 151 (pl. liv) is a smaller fragment of the
same tablet. The remaining three fragments R. 366 80-719, 288 + 293 (pls. lvi&), K. 2,oj3 (pl. lixf.), and K. 8,299
(pl. Ix) are parts of a duplicate commentary to the Seventh
Tablet. The commentary is in the form of a bilingual list,
and presupposes the existence of a Sumerian version of the
Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series ; it gives a list of the
Sumerian words, or ideograms, and opposite each word is
added its Assyrian equivalent, generally in the order in
which the words occur in the Assyrian text. The compartments, or sections, into which the columns of the commentary
are divided, refer to the separate couplets, and frequently to
the separate lines of the Seventh Tablet; and it will be seen
that it is often possible to restore the text of the Seventh
Tablet from the information which they furnish.'
The
following paragraphs deal with the sections of the commentary which have been preserved :S. 11 + S. 980, Obv., col. i (pl. li), 11. 1-10, the commentary
to 11. I and 2 of the text, read : ( I ) ["'I ASAR-RIfa-rib
(2) R U : ;ala-ra-KU(3) SAI< : mi-ril-tu (4) A : iz-ra-tu (5) SInu : ha-a-nu (6) R U : ha-nu-u (7) SAR : ie-im (8) SAR : /ru-u
( g ) M A : a-ju-u (10) SAR : ar-ku. From this we may restore
11. I and 2 of the Seventh Tablet (see the text of I<. 2,854 in
the block on p. 159) as '"'Asar-~ifa-a-ri/r mi-?if-t[i mu-kin

+

' For references to previous publications of various portions of
the commentary, see the Introduction. The text of five additional
fragments of the Seventh Tablet, which I came across after the

verb fa-ra-Ku occurs in 1. z of the commentary, it would be

possible to take the signs GAR and RIG in 1. I as part of the
title, and transliterate the line as
ASAR-RI-GAR-RIG
; and
this would agree with the explanations of the title given in
the Seventh Tablet, as GAR = har~u(cf. Briinnow, No. I 1,962)
and RIG = uvkitu (cf. Br., No. 5,165). But in 1. I of the
Seventh Tablet the signs GAR-RIG are clearly to be rendered

the commentary. The title "'AsAR-RI is therefore explained
as s'a-vik (as in R. 366, etc., Ohv., col. i, 1. I, "'Tu-TU is
explained as ba-a-nu) ; or, which is perhaps preferable, the
scribe wrote the two opening words of the Semitic version

(4) N A : [ . . . . 1. The text reads aZ-hat-siz-u7z ;;-(la1%-ma71-nd-du-IL[ . . . . ] ; 1. 2 of the commentary may
therefore be restored as ZI : [:a-bn-11~1,cf. Br., No. 2,330 ;
zu in 1. 4 is the equivalent of u-ad-du-u, and the equivalent
of N A in 1. 4 may possibly be restored as ~%-7zu,the 3 m. pl.
pron. suffix (but cf. p. 95, n. 15). S.1 1 S. 980, Obv., col. ii,
11. 2-7 (cf. also K. 2,053, Obv., 11. 5-10), which form two sections
upon the tablet, correspond to 1. 18 of the text and read :

The text reads ai ivz-nza-Sii-na a-$a-ti $-&-ta-[ . . . . ] ;
it is clear therefore from 1. 3 that the commentary gives
a slightly variant text, or at any rate a variant reading for
the second word in the line. Lines 8-13 (cf. also I<, 2,053,

The text reads '"'Tzz-tu ""Zi-azag Sal-SiS lin-bu-ZLmu-kiZ

no equivalents occur in the text to 11. (9) and ( 1 2 ) ; while for

gives traces of three sections of the commentary. T h c third
section (I. g) begins with a title of Marduk ; this may
possibly refer to 1. 33 or 1. 35 of the text, but tlic traces of
the preceding section do not appear to correspond to 1. 32
or 1. 34. According to its position in the commentary,
however, this fragment should refer to about that portion of
the text. The fragment 82-3-23, 151 (pl. liv) includes traces
of the right half of three sectio~lsof the com~nentary; the
second section consists of the following words : z1n1-9r2u,
ir-pi-e-tu, inn-ZZL-u,
ha-ji-$a, ni-Si, ti-'-u-tu, and iza-&-nu. The
signs urn-mu, taken in conjunction with ir-pi-e-tz~,may perhaps
Z - ~ Z L at-tafi-jibe compared with the phrase M U - Z I ~ ~ir-pi-e-tu
ba-am-ma, which occurs in the explanatory text S. 747, Rev.,
1. 10 (see below, p. I jo), wliere it is followed by the comment
Mu-urn-mu = rig-vzu. W e might perhaps restore the first
line of the section as ""Mu - zuiz - nzz~,rtinni~ig across the
column ; but Mutnmu, explained as r@i>~z~,
is certainly not
the title of Mardnk, but the name of Apsu's minister ; it is
therefore possible u:?z-muin the commentary refers to Tiamat,
and may perhaps be regarded as a title (cf. Ummu-Hubur).
The sense of the second half of thc line appears to be
that Marduk is the guardian of mankind and gives them
nourishment.
K. 8,299, Obverse (pl. Ix) gives traces of the right half of
three sections of the commentary. The Reverse, 11. 3-14
give the right half of the commentary to the first two lines
preserved by the fragment K. 12,830 (see the block on
p. 163). L.ines 3-6 read : (3) [ . . . ] : ni(?)-hu-[zr]

(6) [

K. 12,830 reads [ . . . . . ] :aZ-wrat [ . . . . . ] ;
this may conjecturally be restored as [ih-hikih-rn-a-te] ?a/-nznt
[ka@anli i6-ni-ma]. The first sign in I. 3 of I<. 8,299 is
broken and its reading as n i is not certain ; iv is possible,
as suggested in the copy on pl. Ix. Lines 7-14) from the
right half of the commentary to the second line preserved

A t this point the scribe of 15. 366, ctc., ceases to give the
commentary in the forin of a bilingual list, and in 11. 28-34
he writes out the text of the Assyrian version of 11. 120-124
of the composition. Then follows a colophon of three lines
which read : (35) niz-nzl-z6-tu(?)ul hala u [ . . . . . ]

[ . . . . . ] of the fifty-one names of [ . . . . . ]
which are in (the composition entitled) ' Asari [ , , . . . I.'"
The reading of 1. 35 is not certain, but the colophon scems
to imply that the commentary was not complete, or else that
the fifty (or fifty-one) names of Marduk were not all given
in the composition' itself. Twb iilnportant facts inay be
deduced from the colophoii. The first is that the Sevcnth
Tablet of the Creation Series is here treatcd as an independent
composition which takes its title from its opening line. The
second is that in this independent form the composition endcd
with 1. 124 of the tablet. I t is clear, therefore, that 11. 125-142
of tlie Seventh Tablet are in the nature of an epilogue, which
was added to the cotnposition at the time it was iticorporated
as the concluding tablet in the series Enzinzic elif.

The supposition t h a t the text of the Seventh Tablet ended
originally a t 1. 124 receives additional support from the
' explanatory text S. 747 (see Cutzeifoonn Texts, pt. xiii, pl. p).'
When complete it is probable that the tablet, of which S. 747
formed a part, contained a kind of running commcntary to
the whole of the Creation Series ; only fragments of the
beginning and of the end of the commentary are prescrved
by S. 747, and these refer to thc First Tablet and to the
Seventh Tablet of the Series respectively. Thus, S. 747, Obv.,
1. I, which reads [ . . . .
] I-iS-tz~-u,-a-~z.zl-SZJ-un,
followed by the comment ,-a-ru-u = [ , . . . . 1, rcfers
to Tablet I, 1. 3 ; 1. 3, which reads [ . . . . . . - t ] i
su-JU-u unp-pa-[ . . . 1, refers to Tablet I, I. 6 ; and the
mention of E n in 1. 5 is in accordaiice with the prornilient
part which the god plays in Tablet I, in detecting and
defeating the plot of Apsu and Tiamat. On the other hand,
the reverse of S. 747 appears to deal with tlie Seventh Tablet
of the Series ; thus, 1. 3 may pcrhaps be compared with tlie
equation sux = '"'E-n, given by I<. 4,406, Rev., col. ii, 1. 25,
in the commentary to a line of the Seventh Tablet (see above,
p. 166) ; 1. 6 possibly contains a reference to the line of the
Seventh Tablet to which the commentary I<. 4,406, Rev.,
col. iii, 11. 16-19? corresponds (see above, p. 167) ; tlie words
in 1. 10, [ . . . ] dnn-7zi-7zn (or [ . . . u]-dniz-7zi-7zn)
ir-si-tunz, possibly refer to 1. 1 1 5 of the Seventh Tablet,
while the second half of the same line perhaps contains
a reference to the line of the Scventh Tablet, to which
the commentary 82-3-23, 1 5 I, section z, corresponds (see
above, p. 162, and for the verb zrt-tnh-ji-biz-nnz-nzn, cf.
Tablet V , 1, 20) ; and the words 7.i-e-fu nr-kn-tzd in 1. 11
clearly rcfer to 1. 107 of the Seventh Tablet. Line 1 2 of
S. 747 q u o t e d . 124 of the Scventh Tablet, follolvecl by the
explanatory equations L (ie. " Fifty ") = @a-n7z-fn-a (i.e.
Mardulc's last title) and L =""Bd. Now, as I. 12 is tlie last
line of S. 747, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the

portion of text it explains came a t the end of the cotnposition to which the commentary refers.
The tablet K.2,107 K. 6,086 (pls. lxif.), which has already
been referred to,' is not strictly a commentary to the Seventh
Tablet of the Creation Series, but is of value for explaini~ig
some of the titles of Marduk which occur therein. The
second column is subdivided by a perpendicular line ; in the
left half of the column are inscribed the titles of Marduk, and
in the right half the explanations are set opposite them.
Lines 9-18 form a single section, and probably give a nurnber
of alternative explanations referring to a single title which
was written in the left half of 1. 9. I n the following transliteration of the text a translation of each Assyrian rendering

In the earlier part of the text the titles which were given on

of the Seventh Tablet, from among which rve may compare

I t was stated on p. 157 that fragments exist of compositions
very similar in character to the Seventh Tablet of the
Creation Series. Remains of one such composition are
preserved by the fragmcnt of a Neo - Babyloi~ian tablet,
No. 54,228, the text of which is published in vol. ii, pl. lxiii,
and by its two Assyrian duplicates, R. 395 (see vol, ii, pl. lxii)
and K. 2, 538 (see the block on p. 176). R. 2, 538 is
a duplicate of No. 54,228, Obv., 11. 6-15 ; R. 395, Rev., 11. 3-5
correspond to No. 54,228, 11. 8, 10, and 12. The Obverse

If this fragment is in the form of narrative, it follows that
11. 1-6 are the concluding lines of a speech, since 1. 7 reads

. . . . I." BE1 did not
answer, however, for 1. 8 reads " H e raised the club [ . . . . I."
Now the phrase ii-fi-ma nzil-!a occurs in Tablet IV of the
Creation Series, 1. 37, but the context on this fragtnent does
not suggest a variant account either of the arming of Marduk
for battle or of the actual fight rvith Tiamat. Moreover,
the Reverse of the fragment, which is in part a duplicate of
No. 54,228 and R. 2, 538 (see above), is inscribed with
addresses in honour of Marduli undcr some of the titles

" BE1 hearkened and his mouth [

which occur on the Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series.
I t is therefore probable that the Obverse of R. 398 contains
a part of the same composition. Line 4, which reads I' H e
opened [ . . . . ] at the sources of the rivers [ . . . . I,"
would in that case refer to some act of creation on the part of
Marduk, and the lines which follo~vwould celebrate incidcnts
in the battle with Tiarnat.

I t will he noticed that 11. 4-17 are written in couplets, the
second half of each couplet being set hack a little from the edge
of the tablet. It is just possible that these second lines give
explanations of phrases in the lines which precede them. I t
appears on the whole more probable, however, that they form part
of the actual text; in that case the couplets in 11. 8 f., l o f., and

Fragmentary as the text of No. 54,228 is, a glance at the
above transliteration will suffice to show that it preserves
part of a composition which is very similar in character to
the Seventh Tablet. That it does not form a missing portion
of the text of that composition, is clear from the occurrence
of certain phrases and titles of Marduk found in parts of the
text of the Seventh Tablet which have already been identified ;
moreover, they are here arranged in a different order and
with a different context. Thus, 1. 6 f. correspond to the

to Tab. VII, 1. 35: and 1. 13 may be compared with the
second half of the same line ; 1. 19 is clearly parallel to
Tab. V I I , 1. 107; 1. 21 corresponds to the line of Tab. V I I
preserved by K. 8,519,1. 8 (see above, p. 104) ; with "'&ans"ri
in 1. 2 2 , cf. Tab. VII, 1. 123; and with 1. 23, cf. K. 8,519,
1. 8, and the commentary to this line, K. 4,406, Rev., col. ii,
1. 31 (see above, p. 166, and vol. ii, pl. Iv), which gives the
reading a-lah-tu. I t may also be noted that in 11. 4 and 5
we have a reference to i!u a d z , "Long-bow," the first name
given by Anu to Marduk's bow upon K. 3,4494 which
probably forms part of the Fifth Tablet (see above, p. 82 t );
GIS-GID-DA in 1. 5 is evidently the Sumerian form of the
name. The title of Marduk, En-bilulu, which occurs in 1. 14,
and is there explained as "the Lord who hath renewed his
land," is found also upon the fragment K. 5,233, which is
described in the following paragraph.

' I t may here he noted that on the fragment S. 298 occur
. . . 1 bu-nu-u fe-im u klle mu-di!-iu
the phrases [
[ . . . .
1, " [ . . . 1, Creator of grain and plants,

"[
. . ] Director of the decrees of [ . . I," and [ . . . .
ha]-nu-u le-ni-fit [
. 1, '' [ .

.
it is clear that the fragment is part of
a composition containing addresses to Marduk as lord of Creation.
Too little is preserved to show whether in this text, as in the
Seventh Tablet, he was addressed under his Sumerian titles.
' On an Assyrian fragment of a hymn, K. 12,582, occurs the
following couplet :' " ~ u g - z mu-di-e

APPENDIX I.

I t has already been remarked that the commentaries to
the Seventh Tablet presuppose the existence of a Sumerian
version of the text, and in the fragment K. 5,233, the text of
which is given in the accompanying block, we may see
a confirmation of this supposition. The fragment is part of
an Assyrian tablet inscribed with a bilingual composition,
and in each line of the Sumerian text which is preserved
Marduk is addressed under a new title. In the following

Fragment of a bilingual composition in honour of Mal-iiuL (I<. 5,233).

transliteration and translation of the fragment the first couplet
preserved is numbered "I," but it should be noted that it
does not mark the beginning of the text :I.

SAG-zu (1. 5) in Tab. VII, 1. 35, and SUH-KUR

from K. 2,107 K.6,086, Ohv., col. ii, I. 31 (see above, p. 174,
and vol. ii, pl. Ixii). The title EN-BILULU
also occurs in the

lithographed plates of vol. ii had been printed off. A t the
beginning of the present year, while engaged on making
a hand-list of the smaller fragments in the various collections
from Kuyunjik, I identified ten such fragments as belonging
to copies of the First, Second, Fifth, and Seventh Tablets
of the Creation Series. The texts of five of these (KK. 2,854,
12,830, 13,761, 8,519, and 13,337), which belong to copies of
the Seventh Tablet, are included in Appendix I under the
sections dealing with those portions of the commentary which
rendered it possible to identify them.' The texts of the
remaining five fragments (KK. 7,871, 4,488, 10,008, 13,774,
and 11,641), belonging to copies of the First, Second, and
Fifth Tablets, are given in the following sections which are
marked A, B, and C. In section D two small Assyrian
fragments (K. zz,ooob and 79-7-8, 47) are described, which
possibly contain portions of the text of the Creation Series.
In section E the text is given of the fragment (S. z,o13),
which contains a reference to Ti-amat e-Li-ti and Ti-amat
$a$-li-ti. Section F deals with the fragments K. 3,445
R. 396 and K. 14,949, which probably contain an account of
the creation of the world by AnSar, in place of Marduk. In
section G the text is given of an address to the River of
Creation which occurs in the opening lines of incantations
upon the fragments S. 1,704 and 82-9-18, 5,311. Finally, in

I n 1.33 the new fragment supports the reading sakrpu a t the
end of the line ; in 1. 34 it confirms the suggested restoration
[ma-ri-e-i'u-un],probably reading [ m ~ v ~ ] " - & - u z; the couplet,
11. 35 and 36, which may be conjecturally restored as Ap[szi
pa]-a-iu i-pu-[;a?%-mai-hub-621, a-na [T]i-anz[at]el-Zi-tu-ma
i-za[h-hara-ma-tum],it condenses into a single line which may
probably be restored as [Apszipa-a-fui-pu-ism]-ma izakkar-fi,
" [Apsii opened his mouth] and spake unto her" ; the end of
1. 37 may now be restored as aZ-hat-sf~-nue-li-ia, i.e. "their
way [is . . . . ] unto me " ; the suggested restoration of the
end of 1. 38 as mu-& [la ~a2-la-ah]is confirmed, the fragment
reading [ . . . . . ] Za fa-al-la-ku ; the end of 1. 39
may now be restored as lu-iizp-pi-i/i, i.e. "Their way will
I destroy and cast down" ; the suggested restoration of the
end of 1. 40 as [ni-i-nil is confirmed, the fragment reading
ni-i-n[i]; the suggested restoration of the end of 1. 41 as i-nu
[Se-mi-Sa] is confirmed, the fragment reading ina fe-mi-e-[fa].
The suggested restoration (from Tab. IV, 1. Sg and Tab. 111,
1. 125) of the phrase iZ-ta-si e-li-[ta] in 1. 42 is shown to be
incorrect, the fragment reading [ . . . . . ] efi 4av-mi[ . . ] ; the line should run i-zu-nz-ma (var. [el-zz--m[a])
iZ-ta-si e-Zi (var. e f i ) bar-mi-[fa(?)]. For the end of 1. 43
K. 7,871 reads [ . . . . . ]-gat e-diS-Si-[ . . 1, and the
verb preserved by No. 45,528 46,614 (see vol. ii, pl. iii) may
probably be read uz-[g]u-ga[t]; the line may thus be partly
restored as [ . . ] mar-si-2' ug-[g]u-ga[t]e-diS-Si-[ . . . . . 1,
" [ . . ] she was grievously angered, alone [she . . . . ] " ;
K. 7,871 probably gave a variant reading for the verb, as the
traces it gives of the sign before gat (or kat) are not those of
gu.2 The suggested restoration of the end of 1. 44 as a-na
[Apsa i-zak-kar] is shown by K. 7,871 to be incorrect, the
fragment reading [ . . . . . ] a-na hay-Si-[ . . ] ; the

It may here be noted that the principal traces of this line upon

line may probably he restored as Li-!nut-ta (var. ti) it-la-di
a-na Kay-Si-[ia (01, " She plotted evil in [her] heart (?)." The
end of 1. 45, according to the fragment, reads [ . . . . . 1-n

[mil-nu-a ni-i-nu Sa xi-i[p-pu-us' Zu]-u nu-us'-&&a&, " What,
then, shall we d o ? Let us destroy ! " The end of 1. 46,

suggested restoration i ni-[i;-LaZ ni-i-nil is incorrect. For

which corresponds to i-ma-nl-[Li-ku]at the end of the line.
Another new fragment of the First Tablet is K. 4,488,
which gives portions of the second halves of 11. 50-63 ; for

for 1. 52 the fragment reads [
. . . . i]&-pu-duan i h n i
lnrirC . . . 1, which gives the variants an for a-na and
mrir[P'*'-&]
for m[a]-ri-e-iu; the fragment reads [ . . . 1ti-di-ir &Sad-[ .
] for 1. 53, which may probably be
restored as [ . . . . ] i-te-dir (var. [ . 1-ti-di-ir) hi-Sad[su], "[ . . . . his] neck was troubled." For 1. 54 the
fragment reads [ . . . . . - i ] u u-na-iak fa-a-[ . . ] ;
it is clear, therefore, that for the restoration [i]-nu-fa-knwe
should read [u]-na-fa-&,and that the duplicate 81-7-27, 80
reads u-nu-as'-:a[&], as suggested on p. 1 1 , n. 8. For 1. 5 5
the fragment reads [ . . . . . ] pu-u/i-ru-US-[
];
for the suggested reading (upon 81-7-27, 80 and No. 46,803)
bu-[ulk-n'-Sn-un, "their first-born," we should read pu-[a]&ri-fu-un, "they all," or "their assembly," and the line may be
translated ''[Because of the evil] which they had planned
together."
For 1. 56 the fragment reads [ . . . . . flu-nu uS-tan-nu-[ . . 1, and gives no variants to the text ;
the verb a t the end of 1.57 may be restored froin the fragment
as i-dul-Ln, "they lay in wait."= For 1. 58 the fragment reads
[
. . . . 1-ku-urn-me$ uf-[ . . 1, and confirms the

.

.

.

. .

'

.

' The traces of this sign upon No. 46,803 are those of u/i, rather
than uk (see vol. ii, pl. ix).
This verb occurs also in Tablet I, I. 89, which reads [ . . . ]
i-du-ul-[li],i.e. " [ . . . . ] he lay in wait," and again in
1. 99, which reads [ . . . . . 1-hi-i: ta-du-ul-qi], i.e.
" [ . . . . 1 thou hast lain in wait!'
The meaning of the
verb ddlu has been pointed out by Thompson in Nebmica, vol. xvii,
p. 163, note 3, where he shows that its participle occurs in an
Assyrian letter in the sense of "scout" ; he also cites IV R, pl. 30*,
Ohv., 1. 16, where i-du-[ul](var. i-dul) may well have the meaning
"to prowl" or "to lie in wait." On p. 1 3 , note I I and p. 66,
note 5 it was suggested that the verb i-[ul-lu-Eu,which occurs in
Tablet IV, 11. 63 and 64, should be transliterated i-dul-lu-fu and
connected with the verbs in Tablet I, 11. 89 and 99. The reading
i-[nl-lu-&~,
suggested by Delitzsch, gives good sense, hut is not
quite satisfactory from the omission of the doubled dental. Jensen
(cf. K.B., vi, pp. 24 f., 334) reads i-dul-lu-fu,and also suggests for

suggested restoration of the second half of the line as
[fa-ku-um]-mi-is" uf-bu. Of 1. 59 the fragment gives the end
as [ .
. .
]-A% te-li-i-['(?)],the traces of the last sign
1 ; in 1. 60 it gives the variant me-hi-fu-n[u]
reading HI[
for me-Ki-Su-u7z ; of 1. 61 it gives the last word as [ . . . . . ]
u-[u], '[
. . , ] he watched him " ; in 1. 62 it gives
the variant el-lu for el-lum, and of 1. 63 it only gives slight
traces of two signs.
B. A FRAGMENT OF TIIE SECOND
TABLET
OF THE
CREATION SERIES. The fragment K. 10,008 is probably
a fragment of the Creation Series, and if this is so the only
place to which it is possible to assign it is the gap between
11. (85) and (104) of the Second Tablet (see above, p. 32 f ) ;
this will be clear for the following reasons. I t will be seen
that the greater part of the fragment is inscribed with part
of a speech of Ansar. Lines 10 and I I read [
. . . .
"']A-nam u l i-Zi-'-[ . , . , . ] and [ . . . . . ]-mud i-d7~v-~tza
i-t[u- . . . . . 1, and may be restored as [af-$?rr-ma ""]A-nam
u l i-&-'-[a ma-bar-fa], ['"'Nu dim]-mud i-duv-??za i - t [ u - ~ a
ar-his'], "[I sent] Anu, but he could not [withstand her];
[Nudimlmud was afraid and turned [back]." Now these
lines occur in Tablet 111, 1. 53 f., in the course of AnSar's
instructions to Gaga, and again in 1. I I I f., in AnSar's message
as delivered by Gaga to Lahmu and Lahamu. Now, although
the phrase "'Mardulz n6haL ilEni occurs in the following line
in each of these passages, the rest of the context upon
K. 10,008 shows that it is not a duplicate of the Third
Tablet. I t therefore follows that the fragment cannot belong
to a later tablet than the Second.
Now 11. (72)-(82) of the Second Tablet describe how Aniar
sent Ann against Tiamat, and it is probable that in the gap

.

.

.

dzlu the meaning "to run round," "to prowl round." In view
of the use of the participle in the sense of "scout," we may perhaps
render the phrase in Tablet IV, 11. 63 f. as "the gods watched him
from hiding" ; the repetition of the phrase empbasises Marduk's
courage in setting out alone to do battle with Tiamat.

after 1. 58 occurred t h e account of how Nudimmud was sent
against T i a m a t a n d how h e turned back.' I t therefore follows
t h a t t h e t e x t of K. 10,008 must b e put in t h e g a p between
11. (85) a n d (104). O n this assumption t h e greater part of t h e
fragment (at least down t o 1. 1 2 ) carries on t h e speech of
AnSar, which begins at 1. ( 8 5 j I n this speech Angar refers
t o t h e fate of Apsu (K. 10,008, 1. z), a n d t h e subsequent
appointment of Icingu b y T i a m a t t o Icad t h c rebcl forces2

I n view of the fact that in Tahlct 111, 11. 5 3 f. and I I I f. AnSar
refers first to Ann's attempt to oppose Tiamat, and then to that of
Nudimmud, it might legitimately he urged that this represents
the order in which the events took place. And, as Ann's attempt
is described in Tablet 11, 11. (72)-(82)) I was inclined, before
I came across K. 10,008, to put Nudiinmud's attempt in the gap
between 11. (85) and (104). But the order in which AnSar refers
to the setting out of Ann and Nudimmud is not necessarily
chronological. Moreover, as Nudimmud had already overcome
ApsU, and as it was he who brought the news of Tiamat's revolt
to Aniar, it would he only natural that he should he the first to he
sent against h e r ; in support of this view it may be further noted
that Nudimmud's name occurs in I. 58. On the other hand, if it
be insisted that Angar's references in Tablet I11 must be talzen to
imply that Nudimmud's setting out against Tiamat followed that
of Anu, it is necessary to place the account referring to Nudimmud
after the line co,njecturally numbered as (85). And, as the earlier
lines of K. 10,008 do not appear to refer to this episode, it follows
that the gap after I. 58 is less than ten lines and that after I. (85) is
greater than twenty lines ; or else that K.10,008 does not belong
to the series Enunza elif, but contains a variant account of the story
of Creation. On the whole it appears to me preferable to suppose
that the order in which the events are referred to in AnSar's
speech is not to be taken as chronological, but as leading up to
a climax ; he says, " Anu I sent, hut he could not withstand her;
and even Nudimmud was afraid and turned haclt."
With the phrase nzi-lam-mi !.bit in I. 4 may he compared
Tablet I, 11. I 18 and 126, and the parallel passages. T h e apparent
reference to ten in place of eleven monsters is noteworthy.

and carry on the war against the gods (1. 7 f.); he the11
describes how he sent Anu and Nudimmud against Tiatnat,
and how they could not withstand her and turned back
(1. 10 f.), and in the following line (I. 12) he either begins
his appeal to Marduk, or, as appears to me more probable,

drinking of wine.
C. T w o FRAGMENTS O F THE FIFTHTABLETOF THE
CREATIONSERIES.-The first eleven lines of the fragment
K. 13,774 correspond (with some interesting variants) to the
text of the Fifth Tablet, 11. 6-16 ; while the last three lines
of the fragment give a variant text to that found in 11. 17-19
upon other copies of the Fifth Tablet. The unimportant
variants may be first noted as follows : in 1. 6 I<. 13,774 gives
the variant ru as the last syllable of "'Ni-6i-ri, and for ana
reads a-na; in 1. 10 it reads u-dun-lzi-na for ud-dan-ni-na ;
in 1. 13 it reads s"uh-nat for Su-uk-nat ; in 1. 14 it reads a g [ f ]
for a-@-[el ; and in 1. 16 it reads a-na for ana. I n 1. 8 it
gives a more interesting variant, reading o''A-~zumin place

read, " H e set the station of BE1 and Anu along with him,"
in place of " H e set the station of BE1 and E a along with
him." For a further discussion of this reading, see the
Introduction.
In 1. 1 2 occurs a still more interesting variant; according
to K. 13,774 the first half of the line runs [ . . . AaklKabai'u 121;-te-pa-a, I' [ . . . . ] his star he caused to shine
forth," in place of "'Nannar-ru ui-te-pa-a, The Moon-god

he caused to shine forth." As the beginning and end of the
line are wanting, it would be rash to conjecturally restore
them ; but it may be regarded as certain that the phrase
iuk-nut +nu-&, " a being of the night," in 1. 13 refers to the
Moon-god, and that the lines which follow contain Marduk's
charge to him. I n the course of Marduli's address to the
Moon-god, in 11. 17 and 18, which upon other copies of the
Fifth Tablet contain directions with regard to the 7th and
14th days of the month, K. 13,774 gives the variant readings

traces of the last character but one in the line, which does
not correspond to those given by I<. 3,567 I<. 8,588 ; a t the
end of 1. zo it gives the variant reading [air-Ka-niS, and it is
possible that K. 3,567, etc., read ar-h[a-nu]-us'; in 1. 21 it
confirms the suggested restoration of the sign ma a t the end
of the line ; and in 1. zz it gives slight traces of the last two
characters in the line.
The reverse of K. I 1,641 has already been used on p. 84 f.,
in the transliteration and translation of the end of the Fifth
Tablet. On p. 85, note 3, it is pointed out that the last six
lines contain the complaint of the gods to Marduk in
consequence of which he conceived the plan of creating
mankind. I t may here be noted that of the last line of the
tablet, K. r 1,641 seems to give traces of MES, the plural sign ;

Reference may also he made to the fragment R. 982 807-18, 178, of which the first few lines of the obverse are given in
transliteration by Delitzsch, Weltschbpfungsepos, p. I ro f., note I ;
for the text, see Cuneifoorm Texts, part xiii, pl. 31. In the character

The fragments of legends, I<. 7,067 and K. 8,572 have been

I<. 11,048 (see Cun. Txts., part xiii, pl. 31) is assigned (with

of the text do not correspond to the last four lines of the First
Tablet of the series Enuma el;;, and as the catch-line does not
correspond to the first line of the Second Tablet, it is clear that
K. rz,oooc is a fragment of the First Tahlet of some other series.
K. 10,791 (Cun. Tx.!~., part xiii, pl. 31) is another fragment which
Bezold suggests may belong to the series Enuma elif, presumahly
from the occurrence of the verbs i6-ha-ni in 11. z and j and
ib-6a-nu-u in I. 4. As, however, it belongs to a text which is
arranged in columns and divided into sections, it is clear that it
does not belong to the Creation Series.

fragment, S. 2,013, which has been copied by Bezold
(cf. Jensen in Schrader's KeiZins. Bihl., vi, p. 307) and by

yet been published. If it is part (as is hardly probahle) of
the Creation Series, the reference to the upper and the lower
Tiamat in 1. of. shows that it cannot belong to an earlier
tablet than the Fifth; while in general style it appears to
resemble the addresses found on the Seventh Tablet, rather

The mention of Labmu in 1. 13 of the reverse may also be
cited in favour of the fragment belonging to the Creation
Series, while the references to Adad (I. 5) and to the city of
A%ur (1. 37) are not necessarily inconsistent with this view.
Lines 23 if.,however, can scarcely be reconciled with the end
of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Series. These lines
read : " (23) An& opened his mouth and spake, and unto
the god [ . . . . he addressed the word] : (24) ' Above

In this speech Anzar, and not
Marduk, appears as the god of creation, which is scarcely in
harmony with the general tenour of the Creation Series.
Moreover, in I. 2 5 An4ar definitely states that he created
E-Sara, whereas in Tablet IV, 11. 144-IA~,
it is related that
Marduk, and not Angar, created E-Sara. Until more of the
text of the Fifth and Sixth Tablets is recovered, it would be
rash to assert that the fragment cannot belong to the Creation
Series ; meanwhile, in view of the itlconsistencies noted, it is
preferable to assume that it does not form part of that work,
but is a fragment of a closely parallel version of the story in
which An4ar plays a more prominent part.

H. THE SUPPOSED INSTRUCTIONS T O MAN A F T E R IIIS
CREATION.-The tablet K. 3.364 (CUIZ.

was thought by George Smith to contain the instructions
given to the first man and wornan after their creation. 111

202

API'ENDIX 11.

The ChaLdedenn Account of Genesis, p. 80, he says, " T h e obverse '
of this tablet is a fragment of the address from the deity to
the newly created man on his duties to his god" ; and a little
later on he adds, " T h e reverse of the tablet appears, so far
as the sense can be ascertained, to be addressed to the
woman, the companion of the man, iilforining her of her
duties towards her partner." In his BabyLor2iscJie WeZsc/li;pfungsepos, pp. 19f., 5 4 f , 88 f., and I I I f., Delitzsch also treats
the tablet as forming part of the Creation Series.? The
recovered portion of the Sixth Tablet of the Creation Series,
however, and the Neo-Babylonian duplicate of K. 3,364, the
text of which is published in vol. ii, pls. Ixiv-lxvi (No. 3335 I ) ,
together disprove the suggested connection of K. 3,364 with
the Creation Series. The reasons on which this collclusion
is based may be briefly stated as follows :-(I) The recovered
portion of the Sixth Tablet indicates that the description of
the creation of man there given was very similar to the
account furnished by Berossus; and it follows that the greater
part of the text must have been in the form of narrative.
If Marduk gave man any instructions after his creation, these
can have occupied only a small part of the tablet. Rut
both the obverse and reverse of I<. 3,364 contain moral
precepts, and the same is the case with colutnns ii and iii
of the new duplicate No. 33,851.~ For such a long serles of
moral instructions there is no room upon the Sixth Tablet
of the Creation Series. ( 2 ) Col. ii of No. 33,851 refers to
certain acts which are good, and to others which are not good,

' The side of the tablet which George Smith refers to as the
obverse is really the reverse: this is rendered certain by the
duplicate No. 3 3 , 8 5 1 .
In my Babylonian R e l w n and Mythology, p. 2 f . I also
provisionally adopted this view.
In col. i of this tablet only the ends of lines are preserved, and
in col. iv a part of the colophon.

in the eyes ef SamaS.' This is quite consistent with the
character of Sama4 as the judge of heaven and earth, but he
does not appear in this character in the Creation Series,
where he is referred to merely as the sun which Marduk
created and set upon his course. (3) In the duplicate, No.
33,851, the text is arranged in columns, two on each side of
the tablet. This fact in itself is sufficient to prove that the
composition has nothing to do with the series Enuvza eLil
The text upon tablets of the Creation Series is never arranged
in columns, but each line is written across the tablet from
edge to edge. This characteristic applies not only to the
copies of the Creation Series from Kuyunjik, but also to the
Babylonian copies of all periods, and even to the rough
" practice - tablets " on which students wrote out extracts
from the poem.
The text inscribed upon K. 3,364 and No. 33,851 is, in fact,
a long didactic composition containing a number of moral
precepts, and has nothing to do with the Creation Series.%
The composition in itself is of considerable interest, however,
for enough of it remains to show that it indicates a high
standard of morality.

THEREis abundant evidence to prove that under the late
Assyrian kings, and during the Neo-Babylonian and Persian
periods, the history of the Creation as told upon the Seven
Tablets of the series Enutnn elif was widely read and studied,
and there can he no doubt that it exercised a considerable
influence on the religious literature which continued to gather
around Marduk's name. In the fragmentary hymns and
prayers which have come down to us, however, it is difficult
to determine how far the priestly and popular conceptions
of Marduk were influenced by the actual story of the Creation
as we know it, and to what extent they were moulded by
earlier legends and beliefs, and by Marduk's own position as
the native god of Babylon. That actual phrases from the
Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series were made use of in
other similar compositions is sufficiently proved by the
fragments published at the end of Appendix I ; and in view
of this fact we may perhaps hear echoes from the earlier
tablets of the series in some of the phrases and attributes
applied to Marduk in the contemporary religious texts. It
would be impossible within the limits of the present work
to attempt an exhaustive treatment of this subject, but, as
a striking instance of such allusions to the Creation story,
reference may here be made to the fragment K. 3,35 I , which,
I believe, has not hitherto been translated?

' A rather rough copy of this tablet is included in Craig's
Religious Texts, pl. 43. As several signs, including 1. 4, are
there omitted, and others are incorrectly copied, the text of the
obverse is given in the block on p. 205.

208

APPENDIX .II

I t will be noticed that in 11. 8-11 the hymn describes the
quaking of the heavens a t Marduk's battle, the trouble of the
Deep a t his wrath, and the flight of the gods from the point
of his weapon. W e have hcre an unmistakable reference to
the battle of Marduk with Tiamat, and the subsequent flight
of the gods, her helpers. The reference in 1. rz to Marduk's
supremacy in the assembly of the gods does not necessarily
refer to the Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series, but the
itnhulZa, or "evil wind," in I. 15, and Marduk's "flame" in I. 16
are clearly reminiscences of the Fourth Tablet, 11. 45 and 96,
and 1. 4 0 ; and in " t h e billowing ocean (tam-iinz)" in 1. 17
we may possibly see a reference to Tiamat. Finally, the
mention of Marduk's bow in 1. 2 0 may be compared with the
Fourth Tablet, 1. 35, and with the fragment of the Fifth
Tablet which describes the translation of the bow to heaven
as the Bow-star (see above, p. 82 f.).
Such references to the Creation story are of considerable
interest, but they do not add anything to the facts concerning
Marduk's character which may be gathered from the Creation
Series itselt An additional interest, however, attaches to
some astrological' fragments which I have come across, inasmuch as they show that a t a late period of Babylonian
history the story of the fight between Mardulc and Tiamat
had received a very definite astrological interpretation. One
of the fragments exhibits Tiamat as a star or constellation
in the neighhourhood of the ecliptic, and, moreover, furnishes
an additibnal proof of a fact which has long been generally
recognized, viz., the identification of the monster-brood of
Tiamat with at any rate some of the signs of the Zodiak.
The most important of the astrological fragments above
referred to is made up of three pieces, Nos. 55,466, 55,486,
and 55,627, which I have rejoined, and its text is published
in vol. ii, pls. Ixvii-lxxii. I t measures 5$ in. by 3; in., and is
part of a large tablet which was inscribed with two, or
possibly three, broad columns of writing on each side. The
fragment of the tablet recovered gives considerable portions
of the first and last columns of the text, as well as traces of

the second column on the obverse and of the last column but
one on the reverse. The colophon, which possibly contained
the date a t which the tablet was inscribed, has not been
preserved, but from the character of the writing and the
shape of the tablet it may be concluded that it does not
belong to an earlier period than that of the Arsacidzc ;
i t may possibly be assigned to as late a date as the first
century B.C.
From the first section which has been preserved of col. i
it is clear that the text is closely connected with the story
of the Creation. This will be apparent from the following
transliteration and translation of the portiolis of 11. 1-7 which
have been preserved : ( I ) [ . . . . . ]-nu Sa !ciFt?"-f!iil

Tablet IV of the Creation Series, I. ~ o rhe
, plunged into the
belly of Tiamat, after he had filled her with the evil wind.
Line z may be explained as referring to Mardulc's conquest
of Icingu after Tiamat's death, without further fighting,
though it is possible that it has some connection with the
obscure expression in Tablet IV, I. 120. I n 1. 3 thc text
returns to Marduk's defeat of T i a m a t ; and with the capture
of the Tablets of Destiny from Icing", referred to in 1. 4, we
may compare Tablet IV, I. r z r f. L.itie 5 possibly refers to
an episode in the Creation which may have been recorded
in the missing portion of Tablet V of the Creation Series.
With it we may compare the fixing of a bolt by Marduk
and the stationing of a watchman, in order to keep thc
waters above the firmament in their placc (cf. Tablet IV,
11.137if.); it is possiblc that a similar guardian was stationed
by Marduk in order to restrain the waters of the Deep. Line
6 f. apparently refer to the il~structionsgiven by Marduk to
the gods, "his fathers," in order " t h a t the deeds of Tiamat
(i.e. her revolt and subsequent conquest by himself) should
not be forgotten."
I t is possible that the instructions which
Mardulz is here represented as giving to the gods refer to
their positions in heaven and to the heavenly bodies associated
with them. If this interpretation is correct, it follows that
the later Babylonians, at any. rate, looked upon the astrological
aspect of the Creation story as in accordance with definite
instructions given by Marduk himself. While they believed
that Marduk actually slew Tiamat and subsequently created
the universe as narrated it1 the tablets of the Creation Series,
they held that the associati011 of the principal actors in the
story with some of the more important stars and constellations
was also Marduk's work, his object being to ensure that the
history of the creation of the world should always be kept in
remembrance.

In this section Marduk and Tiamat appear in their astrological characters, Marduk probably as Jupiter, and Tiamat
as a constellation in the neighbourhood of the ecliptic. The
approach of Tiamat and the Moon and of Marduk (i.e. Jupiter)
and Tiamat would seem from 11. 13 ff. to portend the sending
of an abubu, or d e l ~ g e upon
, ~ the earth, followed by rebellion
and tumult among gods and men. If unchecked, the rvrath
of Bel (i.e. Marduk) would result in the destruction of the
temples and in the ruin of the land. T o prevent the sending
of a deluge and to change the omen to one of prosperity,

I t will be noticed that this portion of the text is in the
main explanatory. Unlike col. i, these lines of the text do
not run on in the form of connected sentences, but are broken
up into a number of equations and explanations of terms and
titles ; thus, some terms are explaitled by a play upon words
(cf. 11. 3 and of), while in other places the reason is given for
certain titles (cf. 11. 6 and 7) or additional names (cf. 1. 12).
With regard to the connection of passages it1 this column
with the Creation Series, it may be noted that Kingu, in
addition to Marduk and Tiamat, is introduced. IIc is herc
associated in an astrological sense with Tiamat, and their
alliance in opposition to Marduk is clearly referrcd to in
11. 4-6. Moreover, the fact that Caper and Scorpio are
mentioned in close connection with this passage shows that

they here occur, not only in their astronomical sense as
constellations of the Zodiac, but also in their mythical
character as monsters in the host of Tiamat. The rcfcrence
to Marduk's "mighty weapon" in 1. 24f. is also notccvorthy.
After the sheets of vol. ii had been printed off I came
across two other fragments of somewhat similar astrological
texts, which furnish additional illustrations of thc manner in
which the legends of the Creation were connected by thc
later Babylonians with astrological phenomena. The smaller
of these fragments, No. 40,959, the text of which is given in

RIIVEI<SE.

Fragment of an astrological explanatory tent (No. 40,')59)

the accompanying block, preserves a few traces of signs from the
beginning of the obverse and from the end of tlic reverse of
the tablet. A few complete words occur in 1. z of the reverse,
which reads [ . , . . . ]-ti: lib-mi Ti-ainnt napiSta-Jil
l[i- . . . . . ] ; I. 112 of the Seventh Tablet of the
Creation Series reads lih-me (var. li-ih-mi) Ti-aitmt 12;-jir-ta-sir
(var. nu-pi?-ta-Su)Li-si-zb u lib-ri (see above, p 1 0 8 f.), and it
is clear that this line is here quoted upon thc fragment.
Both the obverse and reverse of No. 40,959 resemble the
last column of No. 55,466, etc, in being of an explanatory

nature, and it is probable that the quotation froin the Seventh
Tablet is here introduced in an astrological context.
T h e larger of the two fi-agments is No. 32,574, and the text

like No. 40,959, it has in some respects a closc conilection

decrees of Anu, Btl, [and Ea]." Moreover, 1. 3 of the fragment

' At the beginning of the line there is hardly room for the
restoration ['"'As~nu-A]LI~%-NUN

in fact, 1. 6, beginning, "Zii smote and broke his wing,"
evidently gives a quotation from a legend of the Storm-god
Zii,which has nothing to do with, the Creation Series.
Indirectly, however, this line proves that other Babylonian
legends were, like those of the Creation, connected by tlie
later Babylonians with certain of the heavenly bodies. The
four lines inscribed upon the edge of the tablet give a portion
of the colophon, from the last line of which we learn that the
tablet belonged to a series, the title of which reads [ . . . . ,
"']MarduK u 'b'Sar-pa-ni-tu?u BE-51,' and it is possible that
the other astrological fragments above dcscribed (Nos. 55,466,
etc., and 40,959) are parts of tablets belonging to the same
series. T h e occurrence of Marduk's name in the title is in
accordance with the suggested connection bctween these
fragments and the Creation Series.

IV.

anb f4e Comer of @aBeP.
.IN vol. ii, pl. Ixxiii f. the text is given of a fragment of
a legend (K. 3,657))which was thought at one time by George
Smith and others' to contain an Assyrian version of the
story of the Tower of Babel (cf. Gen. xi, I K). The text is very
broken, but from what remains of col. i it would appear to
be part of a legend concerning a god, or possibly a king, who
plotted evil in his heart and conceived a hatred against the
father of all the gods. In col. i, 11. 5 ff. the passage occurs on
which the supposed parallel with the story of the Towcr of
Babel was based, for these lines were believed to refer to the
building of a tower a t Babylon, and to describe how the
tower erected by the builders in the day was destroyed in
the night by a god, who confounded their speech and confused
their counsel. There is, however, no mention of a tower or
building of any sort, and Rabylon is referred to as suffering
through the evil designs of the god or king, described in 11. 2-4.
Moreover, the lines supposed to recount the destructioli of the
tower by night really describe how the complaints of the
oppressed people prevented the king, or possibly an avenger
of the people, from getting any sleep at night up011 his couc11.
The tablet is too broken to allow of a completely satisfactory
explanation of the nature of the legend, but the rendering

a close resembfance t o the story of the temptation of E v e
h y t h e serpent.' T h e tablet which has been supposed t o
contain a n Assyrian version of the story is I<, 3,473
79-74 296 K. 615, which is one of the principal copies
of the Third Tablet of the Creation Series. T h e closing lines
of t h e Third Tablet recount how the gods gathered to a feast
a t Ansar's bidding before they decreed the fate for Marduk,
their avenger' ; the passage which recounts how t h e gods
a t e bread (1. 134) wasbelieved t o contain a reference t o man's
eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, a n d Marduk was
supposed t o be described in 1. 138, not a s the avenger of the
gods, but as the " Redeemer" of mankind. T h i s suggestion
was never widely adopted a n d has long heen given up, but
i t had meanwhile found its way into some popular w o r k s ;
and, as enquiries are still sometimes made for the Assyrian
version of the story of the Temptation, i t is perhaps n o t
superfluous t o state definitely t h e fact of its non-existence.

' The cylinder seal, Brit. Mus., No. 89,326, has heen thought to
furnish evidence of the existence of such a legend, as it represents
a male and a female figure seated near a sacred tree, and behind
the female figure is a serpent. Gcorge Smilh published a woodcut
of the scene in The Chaidean Accozrnt o f GcnesLs, p. 91 ; for
a photographic reproduction of the impressio~lof the seal, see my
Bab. Rel. and iMyLh.,p. I 1 3 .
The suggestion was first made in the Bab. and Or. Rec, iv
(1890),pp. 2 5 1 ff.
a See above, p. 56f., 11. 129-138.

I N the following pages a transliteration and a trans1at'Ion are
given of a remarkable "Prayer of the Raising of the Hand "
t o IStar, No. 26,187, the text of which is published in vol. ii,
pls. lxxvff: A n explanation is perhaps necessary of the
reasons which have led to the publication of this tablet in
a book dealing with legends of Creation and with texts connected therewith. I n a previous work, entitled " Babylonian
Magic and Sorcery: I had collected all the texts belonging
to the series o f " Prayers of the Raising of the H a n d " which
were known to me a t the time ; when later on I came across
the text of No. 26,187 it followed that it must necessarily
be published b y itself, apart from other tablcts of its class.
I t would, of course, have been possible t o delay its publication
until it could be included in a work dealing with a number
of miscellaneous religious compositions, but, in view of the
0s".

' Iztar, to whom the prayer is offered (cf. 1. l o b ) , is in this linc

interesting nature of its contents, it has seemed preferable
to make it available without further delay for students of
Babylonian religion, by including it as an appendix to the
present work. I t will be seen that the text, both from the
beauty of its language aud from its perfect state of preservation, is one of the finest Babylonian religious compositions
that has yet been recovered. The tablet tncasures Skin. by
zkin., and is of the long narrow shape which is one of the
characteristics of the larger tablets of the series to which it
belongs. From the colophon (cf. Rev., 11. I I I K) we gather
that it was copied from an original a t Rorsippa by a certain
Nergal-balitsu-i!cbi, who 'deposited it as a votive offering in
E-sagila, the temple of Marduk at Babylon, whence it was
probably removed before the destruction of the temple. Thc
text is addressed to I 3 a r in her character as the goddess
of battle, and she is here identified with Irliini and with
Gutira (see below, note). Lines 1-41 contain addresses to
the goddess, descriptive of her power and splendour, and
a t 1. 42 the suppliant begins to make his own personal
petitions, describing his state of affliction and praying for
deliverance. A rubric occurs at the end of the text (cf.
11. 107 ff), giving directions for the performance of ccrtain
ceremonies and for the due recital of the prayer.

e.g., Ninni, Nani, Anonitnm, and BElit; and when so identified
she absorbed their names, titles, and attributes. I n these passages
we have two additiolial instances of her identification with othcr
deities.

' As the determinative AN is ctnployed before the ideogram, it is
possible that here and in il. 29 and 104 it si~onldbe rendered as
tile proper name, or title, BZId (cf. thc preceding note). 3:lsewhere
in the prayer, however, t h e word takes in addition the I s. pron.
suffix (cf. 11. 43, 56, 59, 7 2 , 73, 79, 93, and 94) ; it scems more
probable, therefore, that t h e ideogram is cmployed for the substantive 6Tliz1, "lady."
T h i s line probably continues the class of attributes ascribed t o
t h e goddess in the preceding line, and does not form a contrast
t o it ; the meaning " strength " rather than " friendship " is

attributes in the following lines, and the occurrence of if-bur-ti in
1. 11, where any other meaning but L L T h art
o ~ strong" is out of
the question.
It is clear that in this passage we must assign some such active
meaning to the Ifteal of nahiipu.
See above, p. Z Z Z f., n. I .
The second half of the line is in apposition to the phrase
di6ta u purussZ, "the sceptre" representing the control of earth
and "the decision " that of heaven.

The verb rEbu is here used of the "quaking" of the heaven
and earth (see above, p. 206 f., 1. a), and in the follolring line of
the "trembling" of the gods; for its use in the former sense in
the astrological reports, cf. Thompson, Reports ofthe Magicians and
Astrologers, vol. ii, p. ~ z g .
Literally "the black-headed," i.e. mankind.

conveys the meaning of "destruction " or "violence," rather than
" wrong."

67. What have I done, 0 my god and my goddess?
68. Is it because I feared not my god or my goddcss that
trouble hath befallen me ?
69. Sickness, disease, ruin, and destruction are come upon me ;
70. Troubles, turning away of the countenance, and fullless
of anger are my lot,
71. And the indignation and the wrath of all' gods and men.
72. I have beheld, 0 my lady, days of affliction, months or
sorrow, years of misfortune ;
73. I have beheld, 0 my lady, slaughter, turmoil, and
rebellion.
74. Death and misery have made an end of me !
75. My need is grievous, grievous is my humiliation ;
76. Over my house, my gate, and my fields is affliction
poured forth.
77. As for my god, his face is turned elsewhere ;
78. My strength is brought to nought, my power is broken !
79. But unto thee, 0 my lady, do I give heed, I have kept
thee in my mind ;
80. Unto thee therefore do I pray, dissolve my ban !
81. Dissolve my sin,2 my iniquity, my transgression, and my
offence !
82. Forgive my transgression, accept my supplication!
83. Secure my deliverance, and let me be loved and carefully
tended !
84. Guide my footsteps in the light, that among men I may
gloriously seek my way!
85. Say the word, that at thy command my angry god may
have mercy,
confusion"; he probably had omitted the word by mistakc and
intended it to be inserted after ar-?ti.

235

86. And that my goddess, who is wroth, may turn again !
87. The darkness hath settled down, so let my brazier be
bright ;
88. Thou art the ruler,' let then my torch flame forth !
89. May my scattered strength be collected ;
go. May the fold be wide, and may my pen be bolted fast !
91. Receive the abasement of my countenance, give ear unto
my prayer,
92. Truly pity me, and [accept my supplication] !
93. How long, 0 my lady, wilt thou be angry and thy face
be turned away?
94. How long, 0 my lady, wilt thou rage and thy spirit be
full of wrath ?
95. Incline thy neck, which (is turned) away from my affairs,
and set prosperity before thy face ;
96. As by the solving waters of the river may thine anger be
dissolved !
97. My mighty foes may I trample like the ground ;
98. And those who are wroth with me mayest thou force into
submission and crush beneath my feet !
99. Let my prayer and my supplication come unto thee,
100. And let thy great mercy be upon me,
101. That those who behold me in the street may magnify
thy name,
102. And that I may glorify thy godhead and thy might
before mankind !
103 IStar is exalted! IStar is queen !
104. My lady 3 is exalted ! My lady is queen !
The scribe has erased the second half of the line; we may
restore some such phrase as Zi-ki-e un-nz'-ni-ia, as suggested
in the translation.
