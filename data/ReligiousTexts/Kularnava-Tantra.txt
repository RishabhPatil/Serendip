PREFACE
Tantra is a major development in the evolution of
Indian spiritual thought inasmuch as it represents a
determined attempt at reconciling the apparent points of
conflict among the different schools of philosophy that
came up after the age of the Epics. Tantra seeks to
synthesize the monism of the Advaita with the dualism
of the Samkhya, enrich Jnana with the rasa of Bhakti,
join Nature to her Lord in the person of the human
individual, harmonize the claims of the Spirit with the
rights of Matter. It recovers the lost heritage of the
ancient Veda which lays emphasis upon the commonalty
of man, Nature and God and the equality of status
between Mother Earth and Father Heaven. The principle
of Tantra is to reject nothing that God has created, to
utilize every means to raise the human consciousness to
the Divine. Unlike many of the older systems Tantra
is highly rational in its approach; it asks for no faith in
advance. It is a self-verifying science of the development
of natural energies into their supernatural terms leading
to a cosmic enjoyment of life in a spiritual consciousness.
In a word it is the highway of mukti and bhukti in the
highest sense.
The Kularnava is an important text in one of the traditions of Tantra with a pronouncedly practical bent of
thought. It calls upon man to wake up to the rare
privilege that has been given to him, e.g. human birth in
which the being becomes conscious of himself and is
offered a choice: a choice between stagnation and rapid
progression towards his Godhead. He is warned of the
consequences of losing himself in the rounds of transient
excitements and pleasures He is also put on guard against
the many pseudo-paths that abound in this world. He is

viii

PREFACE

asked to purify himself and told how to do it. In unambiguous terms he is told that a wine-drinker is different
from the drinkers of ecstasy; the union of delight is
between the ascending Sakti and the presiding Lord
above, and not between man and woman. In issuing
these warnings, the adepts of the Tantra would seem to
have anticipated the modern turn of mixing up sex with
spirituality. It is a pity that a text like this has not received
adequate publicity in the west where tantra-enthusiasts
are on the wrong track.
The Kulanarva prescribes the modes of preparation for
the high quest; it draws upon ethics, religion, philosophy,
yoga to elevate human life gradually to the level of godly
life. It comprehends the multiple personality of man and
provides for the healthy growth of his mental faculties,
purification of his emotions and passions, orientation of
his physical faculties through ritual, japa, mantra and
upasana. Who is fit for the path of Tantra? Who is
competent to guide the novice on the double-edged razor
path? What is the responsibility of a Guru to a
disciple? These and other relevant questions are raised
and answered in a satisfying manner.
An attempt has been made in the following selections
to present such contents as are eminently helpful to the
needs of the awakened man of today. Portions relating
to rituals, technicalities of special types of japa, etc. have
been kept out of the treatment so as not to tax the aspirant of the present times who has little time or energies
to devote himself to those practices, especially when it is
possible to achieve the same results by more psychological
means suited to the modern age and so elegantly presented in this text. Definitions of most of the important
concepts and terms in the Tantra Sastra, as given in the
text, will be found highly educative.

INTRODUCTION
T h e Kularnava is a leading and perhaps the
foremost Tantra of the Kaula School. It enjoys
a great reputation amongst works of its class and
as such is constantly cited as an authority. T h e
Chapters of the Text here published n u m b e r
seventeen and the verses total 2058 according as
there are included or not vv. 123-144 in the tenth
Chapter. The Colophon however states that the
portion here printed is only the fifth part of the
whole T a n t r a consisting of 1,25,000 verses. T h u s
the Colophon of the first Chapter runs - " E n d of
the first Chapter being the first portion of the
fifth part entitled Urdhvamnaya Tantra of the
great Mystery and most excellent among
Agamas containing, 1,25,000 verses entitled the
Kularnava T a n t r a . " If this statement be correct
I have not on enquiry been able to discover the
whole work. Every Ms. which I have come
across contains the seventeen Chapters only here
printed. Either then the rest of the book is lost
or possibly exists under some different names.
T h e Kaulavali which is a compendium by
Jnanananda Paramhamsa quotes long passages
as from the Kularnava which do not occur in
a n y of the texts consulted in the preparation of
the present volume. T h e work has been already
twice printed and therefore would not in the
ordinary course have found place in these texts
according to the original design of the publication. It was found however that the previous
editions of this and other Tantras w e r e in
general so incorrect that the present edition is

4

KULARNAVA TANTRA

not unnecessary. The former editions w e r e
those of Rasik Mohana Chattopadhyaya and of
Pandit Jivananda Vidyasagara. The former
published at Calcutta the Tantrasara and
T a n t r a s in parts, the first of which appeared in
the Bengali year 1285 (1878-79) and the edition of
the latter was published at the same place in the
y e a r 1882. In Rasik Mohana Chattopadhyaya's
and Pandit Jivananda's edition of the Kularnava
t h e r e are twenty-one verses at the end of the
T e n t h Chapter which do not occur in any of the
four Mss. which have been consulted. These
have been printed. Both these editions seem to
have been based on a single Ms. without a n y
attempt to correct obvious errors in the text. In
the preparation of the present texts four Mss.
have been consulted lettered

Ms. which m a y be identified as

and have been lent by the Varendra Anusandhana Samiti of which I have the honour to be a

District of Malda and

as stated is the text used in the
previous printed editions. In the present edition
variant readings of importance have been given
in the footnotes. It is however not claimed for
the present edition that every difficult passage
has been made clear but the obscurities have
been so considerably reduced as to render the
present edition a practical working text.
Another inducement for its publication was the

INTRODUCTION

fact that there is in hand an English translation
of the present work and if it is found possible to
publish this the Sanskrit-knowing reader can
compare the English translation with the T e x t
on which it is based. For this reason the size of
the present edition of the Text is that of the
proposed translation, which, if published, w i l l
be the same format as the Mahanirvana.
T h e Kularnava is w o r t h y of a close studyby those who would understand the tenets and
practices of the School of which it is a Shastra.
Having however regard to the fact that it is
hoped to publish a translation of the entire text I
have not thought it necessary to give such a
detailed analysis of the T a n t r a as in the absence
of such a translation it would have deserved. I
therefore only here give such a s u m m a r y as
under the circumstances stated seems sufficient.
T h e first chapter opens with some fine verses
(vv. 1-121). Devi tells Shiva of how men a r e
suffering and asks the means whereby they m a y
be liberated. Ishvara in reply speaks of the
Brahman and of the creatures who encircled by
Maya are like sparks of fire parts of him. Of
these m a n is the greatest. He is a self-killer
who having attained m a n ' s estate yet seeks not
his t r u e good. " H e w h o does not cure himself
of the disease of Hell w h a t will he do when he
yet suffering from such disease goes to a place
w h e r e there is no m e d i c a m e n t ? " (v. 24). T h e
Lord then dwells on the transitoriness of life
and of all things therein. " P r o s p e r i t y is like a
dream, youth is like a flower. Life is seen and
is then gone like lightning. How can anyone
w h o knows this yet r e m a i n content?" (v 30).
Moreover the world is full of evils which arise

6

KULARNAVA TANTRA

from attachment (v 55). Shiva says " O h Beloved
to sleep, to copulate, to eat and other such functions are common to all animals. Man alone is
possessed of knowledge. He who is devoid of it
is a b e a s t " (v 69). Shun h i m who is addicted to
the pleasures of the world and who yet boasts
Brahman knowledge. T h e r e are other impostors
also. Liberation is not to be got by m e r e l y
smearing oneself with ashes, feeding on husks
and water, exposure to heat and cold and the
like. "Donkeys and other animals go about
naked. Are they therefore Yogins?" (vv 79-86).
N o : then gain true knowledge and avoid idle
talk. What is the use of Vedas, Agamas and
Puranas if one knows not the supreme object of
life - (v 89)? " R e n o w n e d men dispute among
themselves - some saying the truth is ahead and
some that it is behind, others again say it is on
either side. Some say it is like this, others like
that " ( v 99). All such bewilder themselves w i t h
Scriptures and talk. T h e y lack realization
(Pratyakshagrahanam) (v 100). The Sastras a r e
n u m b e r l e s s : one should master their essential
t r u t h and then put t h e m aside just as he w h o
seeks the grain of paddy throws away the h u s k
and straw (v 103). Real knowledge alone
liberates. Ritual and austerities are needful
only so long as the Real and the true are not
known (v 113). Shiva concludes " W h a t is the
use of many words? It is Kuladharma which
liberates. Beloved, I have spoken to Thee in
brief of the creature and how he should l i v e "
(v 121).
Chapter II deals w i t h the greatness of Kulad h a r m a which Shiva has
extracted after
churning the great ocean of the Vedas and

INTRODUCTION

7

Agamas (v 10) and which excels all others as the
light of the Sun surpasses that of the firefly (v 16).
The Yogi cannot enjoy; and he who enjoys
cannot know Yoga but in Kuladharma there is
both Bhoga and Yoga (v 23). But Kaula knowledge can only be gained by one whose mind is
pure and who has controlled his senses (v 33). In
v 84-85 Shiva says that the six philosophies a r e
the six limbs of Kula. T h e Kaula Shastras a r e
based on Veda. " T a s m a t vedatmakam shastrang
vidhi kaulatmakang priye (v 85)." Many however
being ignorant of the traditional teaching of
Kuladharma cheat people by their false knowledge (v 116). Moreover the Kula path is full of
dangers (v 122). So also the Buddhist Vajrayana
is (I m a y add) compared to a hollow bamboo in
which a serpent is placed. It must go up at
peril of falling down. He who fails on this path
is l i k e l y to go to Hell. T h e Pashu should therefore avoid this method (v 124). Vv 140, 141 cite
authorities from Shruti (Rigveda) in support of
the doctrine taught.
T h e third Chapter treats of the Paraprasada
m a n t r a that is Hamsah which, as the great
Cosmic Breath, pervades the world, opening (v 4)
with the assertion that Vedas, Puranas and other
Shastras m a y be preached abroad; whereas the
Shaiva and Shakta Agamas are mysteries (v 4).
V 10 refers to the four Amnayas or traditions,
some portions of which appear in the T a n t r a
Shastras. Urddhvamnaya is not to be learnt
by study of the Shastras but from its masters
(v30).
Chapter IV which is a difficult one deals w i t h
Mahashodhanyasa. F r o m it as well as other
parts of the work m a y be learnt how rigorous

8

KULARNAVA TANTRA

the Sadhana is which is required of those w h o
are entitled to participate in the Kaula rites.
T h e fifth Chapter treats of the greatness of
Kula. It contains a description of the Kaula
substances; the making of w i n e ; the various
kinds of w i n e ; its use as Chitta-shodhanasadhana so that the mind m a y become Bramagah.
V 48 enumerates the fundamental doctrines of
this school that "success is attained by those
very things which lead to f a l l " (Yaireva patanang dravyaih siddhistaireva chodita). V 50
refers to animal sacrifice: and vv 67, 68 to the
necessity of wine and meat in the various forms
of worship including the Buddha. V 90 Says
" A s soma has been ordained a Brahmana should
d r i n k ; " which other T a n t r a s are said to deny.
If this however be done in the ordinary a n i m a l
w a y even a Vira w i l l go to Hell (v. 93). Nectar
drinking is the union of Kundali Shakti w i t h
the Moonchit (Chichchandra). Others are but
w i n e drinkers (vv. 107-108). The true meat eater
is he who has merged his Chitta in the Supreme
(v. 109). He who controls his senses and unites
t h e m with Atma is a fish-eater. The rest do but
k i l l animals (v. 110). T r u e sexual union is t h e
union of Para Shakti that is Kundali with A t m a ;
others do but have carnal connection w i t h
w o m e n (vv 111, 112).
T h e sixth Chapter deals with the characteristics of the worshipper, of worship and purification of Kaula substances. Vv 37-46 deal w i t h
the lunar, solar, fiery Kalas orginating from the
vowels, the consonants Ka-kha to Tha-da and the
Yavarga respectively; the Kalas of Kavarga and
Chavarga, Tavarga, Thavarga, Pavarga and
Yavarga and Shavarga. Then follow several

INTRODUCTION

9

mantras. Vv 63-67 give the Gurus. Yantra is
defined in vv 85-86.
Chapter VII describes worship of Vatuka,
Shakti and others. In vv. 42-44 the eight kinds
of Kula Shakti are enumerated. Vv. 70-75 are
noteworthy for they refer to the 36 Shaiva
Tattvas and not the Sangkhyan 24 thereby
denoting the connection of this Tantra with the
former philosophical Darshana. V. 96 prohibits
drinking in excess so as to produce unsteadiness
of mind. V. 99 contains the oft quoted verse
" D r i n k and drink a g a i n " which some erroneously suppose is an invitation to drunkenness:
notwithstanding the previous injunction and the
warning that he who disobeys it is likely to go
to Hell. T h e verse refers to Yoga " d r i n k i n g . "
Chapter VIII deals with the Chakra and the
various forms of Bliss. T h e Sadhaka passes
through these from Arambha to Praudhanta in
which state the Chakra is held to Unmana and
then to Tata. In Praudhanta everything which
is done is an offering to Bhairava (v. 59).
Unmana is the state in which the Sadhaka is no
longer affected and Tata is the very self of the
Supreme Mantra (vv. 83-84), T h e states up to
Praudhanta are waking (Jagrat). Unmana is
is dreaming (Svapna). Anavastha is dreamless
sleep (Sushupti). The seventh Ullasa is Liberation (vv. 94, 95). (Turiyavastha).
Yoga is treated of in Chapter IX. Advaita
doctrine in its form Aham Brahmasmi is accepted (v. 32). Jiva is Shiva and Shiva J i v a : the
only difference is that one is in bondage and the
other not (v. 42). A noteworthy passage which
explains some acts which disconcert others say
" t h e Kulayogi behaves in such a way that men

10

KULARNAVA TANTRA

laugh at him and reproach and revile a n d shun
h i m " (v. 4). But himself doing acts of kindness
to all, he roams the earth (v. 75). Kaulika. is
denned in v. 88. " O h Thou of beautiful eyes I
dwell not in Kailasa or in Meru or in Mandara
but I am wherever the knowers of Kula are "
(v. 94.).
The tenth Chapter treats of worship on
special days and the eleventh with the rules of
Kulachara which should be carefully concealed
(v. 84). The twelfth Chapter treats of the Paduka
Mantra. V. 58 prohibits discussion with Atheists
or unbelievers in Veda (Nastika). The subject
of the Guru is dealt with at some length. T h e next
Chapter (XIII) continues the subject of Guru
(v. 41) and disciple (vv. 1-40) and their qualifications. Amongst other defective persons, men
w h o are lewd, given to drink and stupid are to
be rejected. The Guru should realise that he is
inseparate (avichhinna) that is one w i t h the
Brahman which pervades the whole universe
(vv. 67-68). V. 82 refers to the Lingas in the
bodily centres and v. 90 gives the eight bonds
(Pasha) which bind the Pashu. The Guru is he
who by destroying the pleasures of the senses
gives Brahman-Bliss (v. 97).
Chapter XIV deals with the testing (Pariksha)
of the qualifications of Guru and disciple; and
Chapter XV treats of Purashcharana and other
matters. Pranayama is dealt with (v. 35 et seq).
Vv. 65-69 mention the " d e f e c t s " of Mantras and
vv. 71-72 state the purificatory rites which
remove them. T h e various kinds of Mantras,
Siddha, Sadhya and the like are described. V. 96
classifies the letters according to the Mahabhutas.
When doing Japa a man should control his

INTRODUCTION

11

a n i m a l propensites, eat sparingly, live hardly,
cultivate faith and devotion and fix his mind and
heart solely on " T h a t " (vv. 110-113). Chapter
XVI deals with rites done for the attainment of
various objects of desire. Chapter XVII gives
the meaning of a large n u m b e r of words such as
Guru, Acharya, Deshika and so forth and contains a Dhyana of the Guru. At the end of the
seventeenth Chapter there is a remarkable
passage (v. 103) prohibiting (ordinary persons)
from reading the portions of this work dealing
with Asavollasa. This prohibition doubtless
has been prompted by the desire that such persons should not be led astray and take to
practices which might lead to their moral ruin.
For it is to be noted that according to the Shastra
the Rahasyapuja is not for all and any but for
such w h o m the Guru m a y consider qualified and
have been duly initiated. Except under the
conditions prescribed the Sadhana with wine
and so forth is prohibited and its accomplishment is admittedly harmful. But under the
conditions prescribed this Sadhana is said to be
the practical application of the principles of
Advaitavada which the Agamas of this school
teach.
I desire here to express my thanks for the
loan of Mss. to Pandit A m u l y a Charana Vidyabhushana, Rai Kumudini Kanta Bandopadhyaya
Bahadur, Principal of the Rajshahi College and to
the Varendra Anusandhana Samiti.
T h e next volume of this series will be the
Kalivilasa Tantra which is now almost ready
for publication. There is also in preparation
the very important and previously unpublished
Kadimata Tantra or Tantraraja with its

12

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Commentary called Manorama under the editorship of Mahamahopadhyaya Lakshmana Shastri.
T h i s I expect* to publish in two volumes next
year, to be followed I hope by the Tibetan text
of a rare and unpublished Buddhist T a n t r a
which deals with the Mandala (Kyil-khor) of
Shrichakrasambhara.
I have already the offer of a large n u m b e r of
Texts for this series, more in fact that I can ever
p r i n t ; but I take this opportunity of saying that
I shall be pleased to hear from any one w h o has
Manuscripts of sufficient importance to justify
their publication. T h e field of selection w i l l
thus be widened with, it is hoped, better results.

CHAPTER I

HUMAN BIRTH AND LIFE*
The Kularnava is the most frequently cited
text in the Tantra literature not only because
it is a leading authority on the Kaula Marga†
which is the most important and daring
formulation of the Shakta school of the Agamas,
but also because of its comprehensive sweep
which takes in all the fundamentals of the
Tantra Sadhana, its underlying philosophy and
its many implications, ethical and social.
Written in the simplest possible style - as indeed
all the great agamas are - with telling
metaphors and imagery, incorporating many of
the gnomic passages in the Tantras, this work
of seventeen chapters consists of a little over
two thousand verses ranging over a wide variety
of topics but always stressing the practical side
of the agamic wisdom and calling attention to
the urgency of following it in this very life.
The text opens with a question by the Devi,
the compassionate Mother of the universe,to Her
* Ullasa 1
† Of the many derivations of the word kaula, the
following cited by Bhaskara Raya (in his celebrated
commentary on the Lalita) seems to us the most h a p p y :
kulam Saktiriti proktam, akulam Siva ucyate; kule akulasya
sambandhah kaulamityabhidiyate. Kula, Shakti; Akula,
Shiva; the relation of Akula w i t h Kula i.e. the harmonious relation of Shiva and Shakti is Kaula.
Thus Kaula Marga is that which accepts and leads to
the equipollence of Shiva and Shakti, not Shiva alone or
Shakti alone, not to the Static alone or to the Dynamic
alone.

eternal Spouse, as to the possible way by which
all these creatures involved in an endless round
of suffering, birth and death, could obtain
release.
There is One Real, says the Lord, He is
Shiva the Parabrahman, Featureless, AllKnower, All-Doer, Sovereign of All, Stainless,
One without a second. Self-luminous, without
beginning or end, without attribute, without
change, beyond the highest, He is the
Saccidananda.
All the jivas, the m y r i a d
creatures, are portions of Him, like sparks of
the Fire*. Attached to the Ancient Ignorance
and regulated by their own volition and action,
influenced by their environment, they go on
passing from birth to birth. Many are the
kinds of births taken by each jiva which passes
through the several gradations of life on earth
e.g. immobile creation, the mobile ranging from
insects, the egg-born, birds, animals, men in
different stages of development, gods, to the
liberated beings†. Of these the human birth is
the most important for it is then that one
becomes awake, aware of his state of bondage
and the necessity of release and is in a position
to take steps for his liberation from its hold.
He has a self-will and is not totally subject to
* "As from one high-kindled fire thousands of different
sparks are born and all have the same form of fire, so,
O fair son, from the Immutable, manifold becoming are
born." {Mundaka Upanisad II-l-l)
† Mark the position of superiority given to the liberated being over the gods, in the tantric evaluation.
T h e bodies assumed are of four k i n d s ; udbhijja, born
from the ground (breaking out), svedaja, born of sweat,
andaja, of egg, jarayuja, of womb.

the impulses and drive of Nature as are beings
lower than him in the scale of evolution. He
has a mind that can see and organise.* T h e
T a n t r a s have it that the h u m a n birth is got after
going through as many as eighty-four lakhs of
inferior births. And even beings higher than
man envy his birth† because it is only h u m a n
life on this earth, which is a field of evolution,
that holds the possibility of change, progress
and release. The Purana declares that the very
gods have to come down on earth and embody
* For man, below the god, above the brute,
Is given the calm reason as his guide ;
He is not driven by an unthinking will
As are actions of the bird and beast;
He is not moved by stark Necessity
Like the senseless motion of inconscient things.
The giant's and the titan's furious march
Climbs to usurp the kingdom of the gods
Or skirts the demon magnitudes of Hell;
In the unreflecting passion of their hearts
They dash their lives against eternal Law
And fall and break by their own violent mass:
The middle path is made for thinking man.
To choose his steps by reason's vigilant light,
To choose his path among the many paths
Is given him, for each his difficult goal
Hewn out of infinite possibility.
(Sri Aurobindo: Savitri, V'I-1)
† "There is no birth like the human birth. Both the
gods and the manes desire it. For the Jiva the human
body is of all the bodies the most difficult to come by.
For this it is said that the human birth is attained with
extreme difficulty
It is said in all the Sastras that of
the jiva's eighty-four lakhs of births the human birth is
the most fruitful. In no other birth can the Jiva acquire
knowledge of the Truth. Human birth is the stepping
stone to the path of Liberation. But rare are the meritorious who come by it." ( Visvasara Tantra)

For the T r u t h is to be realised here in this
life. If here you do not find and work out the
means for your release w h e r e else is it possible?
It is possible nowhere. " G r e a t is the perdition," says the Upanishad, " i f here one comes
not to the Knowledge."* It is vain to expect
that things will change and improve after death
in w o r l d s which are happier than ours. As
here so there. " W h a t is in this world, is also
in the other." (Katha Up.)† The condition in
which you live here pursues you elsewhere
a l s o ; the change or improvement cannot come
from outside of yourself. It has to be worked
out by yourself from within yourself. The
state of your consciousness attained while in
the body is also the state of your consciousness
elsewhere. The world you reach after the body
is shed is determined by the level of the consciousness reached while in the body. " I f in
this world of men and before thy body fall
from thee, thou wert able to apprehend it, then
thou availeth for embodiment in the worlds
that He creates." (Katha Up.)‡ So, as long as the
body lasts, exert yourself towards the goal of
liberation.
Remember, the body does not last for ever.
Age prowls like a leopard, diseases strike like
an enemy. Before the limbs lose their vitality
and before adversities crowd upon you, take to
the auspicious Path. T r u l y , it is a wonder howmen can be so complacent and unmindful when
everywhere there is thunder of crash. T i m e

flies without your knowing. Prosperity is like
a dream,* youth like a blossom, life-span
m o m e n t a r y like lightning. Even a hundred
years is too little; for half the life is spent in
sleep and the other half is made infructuous by
infancy, disease, misery, age and what not.
Lack not in industry for that which is to be
obtained, sleep not where you are to be a w a k e .
Deluded by Ignorance, man looks not at what he
sees, grasps not what he hears, follows not w h a t
he reads. He fails to see that with every moment
that passes his body decays. The Wolf of T i m e
rushes upon him when he is still prattling of
"nay children", " m y wife", " m y wealth",
" m y relations"†. Death swallows him when he
is still thinking of what is done, what is yet
to be done and what is half-done. Therefore do
today w h a t is required to be ready tomorrow,
do in the forenoon what is meant for the afternoon; Death waits not to see what is done or not
done. Wise man, do you not see prowling
towards you on the route of age, the foe of Death
armied with the host of diseases? Cut into by
the spear of desire, moistened in the lubricant
* "I know of treasure that it is not for ever; for not
by things unstable shall one attain That One which is
stable." (Katha Up. I. 2. 10)
Here on this mutable and ignorant earth,
Who is the lover and who is the friend ?
All passes here, nothing remains the same.
None is for any on this transient globe.
He whom thou lovest now, a stranger came
And into a far strangeness shall depart.
(Sri Aurobindo: Savitri, VI-1)

And walk into the snare of Death that gapes wide for t h e m . "

of sense-enjoyment, cooked in the fire of like
and dislike, man is the banquet of Death.
Helplessly he swings from birth to death and
again from death to birth. He goes from here
to there as from house to house. What is sown
here is reaped elsewhere. Of a tree that is
watered at the roots, the fruits are seen on the
branches above. Freedom from desire, nonattachment, is the only w a y to liberation; all
evils are born of attachment*. Even the Jnanin
is moved by attachment, w h a t to speak of lesser
people, †
Therefore give up attachment, give it up
wholly, sarvatmand, not by the mind alone, but
by the whole of your being including your
desire-self. If you cannot do it in your weakness, resort to the company of the Good. Holy
company acts as medicine. He who has no
company of the holy, no discrimination, no
pure vision, he is indeed blind, how can he fail
to take the wrong path? Engaged constantly in
the round of food, drink, sex and sleep, one is
no more than an a n i m a l . Only he who has
knowledge is a man. Be a man, pursue the t r u e
object in life, acquire Knowledge of the Supreme
Truth.
* " I n him whose mind dwells on the objects of sense
with absorbing interest, attachment to them is formed ,
from attachment comes d e s i r e ; from desire anger. Anger
leads to bewilderment, from bewilderment comes loss of
m e m o r y ; and by that the intelligence is destroyed; from
destruction of intelligence he perishes."
(Bh. Gita. 11-62, 63)
† " E v e n the mind of the wise man who labours for
perfection is carried away by the vehement insistence of
the senses."

Engaged ceaselessly in the performance of
their respective class-duties and little else, men
do not see the Higher T r u t h . Engrossed in r i t u a l
and austerities they know not their own self.
Content only with the n a m e , these men delight
in the Ritual, are deluded by the repetition of
mantras, homas and elaborate sacrifices.* And
they hope to realise the Highest by austerities
emaciating the b o d y ! If the ignorant could
achieve freedom only by punishing the body,
the serpent should lie dead when the ant-hill is
struck. Beware of these pseudo-gurus. Intent
on amassing wealth, showily, attired in disguise,
they wander everywhere as Jnanins and throw
others in delusion. Attached to the pleasures of
the world, they yet proclaim, 'I know t h e
Brahman'. Fallen† both from works and from
knowledge, they are to be shunned. Are there no
asses and the like to w h o m home and forest a r e
the same and who wander about naked without
shame? Do they become yogins thereby? If men
could get liberated by coating themselves with
* "' Come w i t h u s ' , ' C o m e w i t h u s ' , they cry to h i m ,
these l u m i n o u s fires of sacrifice and t h e y bear h i m by the

mud and ashes, are all the country-folk who
live in mud and ash, freed? Denizens of the
forest like deer and other animals live only on
grass, leaves and water; do they become yogins
thereby? Frogs and fish live all their lives in
rivers like the Ganges; do they acquire special
merit thereby? Pigeons eat nothing but stone;
the Chataka bird does not partake of the water
on earth; are they too yogins thereby? Truly,
such privations and self-denials are only for
deceiving the world. The only means for
liberation is the knowledge of the Truth, the
Divine. This Truth is not known by those who
are plunged in the discussions and debates of the
philosophies of the Six Darshanas or caught up in
the subtleties of the Sastras. They who have read
the Veda, Agama and Purana and yet know not of
the Highest Truth of the Divine, - the true object
of life - are a fraud, cawing like the crow. With
their backs turned on the Real Truth to be
known, the Divine, they pore over books
ceaselessly, anxiously, saying 'this is to be
known', 'this is knowledge', and so on. Indeed,
it is to such that the Upanishad sounds the
warning: "If thou thinkest that you knowest it
well, little indeed dost thou know the form of
the Brahman." *
Lost in the enchantments of poetry,
embellishment, style and other artifices, they
stand befuddled. The real Truth is one and
"what they understand is quite other;† one is the

purport of the scripture and other is what they
interpret * They speak of high states of egoless
consciousness but what they live in is totally
different if not the very contrary. They chant
the Vedas and dispute among themselves but
like the ladle that does not know the taste of
the treacle it holds, they know not the T r u t h .
T h e flowers may lie on the head but it is the
nose and not the head that gets their fragrance.
Many are they who chant the Veda-Scriptures
but r a r e is he who is one with their spirit.
Forgetting that the Divine T r u t h is w i t h i n
themselves,† they look for it in the books, like
the shepherd who searches for the goat in the
well when it is already in the flock. Verbal
knowledge is of no avail for the destruction of
the delusion of the world. It is only the man of
awakened intelligence‡; that can benefit from the
Sastra. Without this intelligence, prajna, one
can only talk of the Divine T r u t h being in this

direction or that, of this kind or another, but
there can be no direct apprehension, realization,
of that T r u t h . Can you seize by mere t a l k !
You m a y spend a thousand years hearing of
knowledge in the Sastras, but you will never
reach their end. Endless is the expanse of the
Sastras, the life-duration is but limited, obstacles
are legion; it is wisdom to go straight to the
essence of the scriptures, like the swan sipping
milk out of water. Study, know their essential
truth and then leave them aside like husk after
collecting the grain.
Once this essence, this T r u t h is known all
other knowledge is useless. Mukti, Liberation, is
not to be obtained by the chanting of the Vedas,
nor by the study of the Sastras; Jnana, real
knowledge alone can give the liberation.
Neither asramas (prescribed stages in life) nor
philosophies nor sciences can give the
deliverance; only Jnana can give it. And this
Jnana is received through the Word of the Guru.
All other w a y s are deceptive, oppressive; the
Truth-Knowledge alone is life-giving.
It is a star lighting an ignorant sea,
A lamp upon our poop piercing the night.
As knowledge grows Light flames up from w i t h i n ;
It is a shining warrior in the mind,
An eagle of dreams in the divining heart,
An armour in the fight, a bow of God.
Then larger dawns arrive
Man's knowledge becomes God's supernal Ray.
(Sri Aurobindo: Savitri X-3)

The supreme Knowledge of the One declard
by the Lord, free from ritual and austerity, is to
be received through the mouth of the Guru.
The Word of the Guru, it must be noted, is the

28

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Voice of the World-Teacher that speaks through
him to the disciple. And on knowing thus
through the Guru, one is happily delivered from
the bonds of the world. This is the Para Vidya
lauded by the Upanishad as distinct from the
apara * which is of two kinds: knowledge
derived from the scripture and knowledge born
of mental reasoning. The Sabda-brahman, Veda,
is the first and the ideative conception of parabrahman is the second. Some prefer non-dualism,
advaita, and some dualism, dvaita. But none of
them knows my Truth which is above both dualism
and non-dualism, dvaitadvaita-vivarjitam.
" M i n e " (mama) is the term that acts for
bondage; "Not-mine" (nirmana) is the term that
spells release. True work†, true knowledge, is
that which frees; all other work gives only
fatigue, all other knowlege makes only for
artistry.
Talk not of the higher Purpose as long as
there be desire, attachment and activity of the
senses. Talk of it not as long as there be the
agitation of exertion, activity of thoughts and
the mind is not steady. Talk not of the higher
Purpose as long as you are identified with the
body, as long as there is the ego-feeling and so
long as there is no Grace of the Guru.
Austerities, observances, pilgrimages, japa,
homa, worship, the Vedas, Agamas and Sastras *"Twofold is the knowledge...the higher and the
lower. Of which the lower, the Rig Veda, and the Yajur
Veda, and the Sanaa Veda and the Atharva Veda, chanting,
ritual, grammar, etymological interpretation, and prosody
and astronomy. And then the higher by which is known
the Immutable." (Mundaka Up. 1-1-4, 5)

all these a r e resorted to o n l y so long as the
Supreme T r u t h of the Divine is not attained.
So be minded of the T r u t h Divine, dedicated
to its pursuit, in all conditions, with all effort.
Afflicted as you are with threefold distress*,
take to the shade of the T r e e of Liberation, on
whose branches flower Dharma and Jnana, the
Right Law and the True Knowledge, and whose
fruit is the World of Bliss, † In a word, the Way
of Liberation lies in the Kula-dharma, the
Royal Road of Shakti.
This is the truth, this the secret.

* Of body, life and mind or material, spiritual and
environmental.
† Only when thou hast climbed above thy mind
And livst in the calm vastness of the One
Can love be eternal in the eternal bliss
And Love divine replace the human tie.
There is a shrouded law, an austere force:
It bids thee strengthen thy undying s p i r i t ;
It offers its severe benignances
Of work and thought and measured grave delight
As steps to climb to God's far secret heights.
Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage,
Each year a mile from the heavenly Way,
Each dawn opens into a larger Light.

CHAPTER II

GLORY OF KULA-DHARMA*
And what is Kula-Dharma?
Handed down from mouth to mouth in the
long stretch of holy tradition, the Doctrine of
Kaula is the highest and the most guarded from
the profane and the unqualified. Seven are the
Ways for the liberation of man. The first is the
path of karma, the Vedic r i t u a l ; this is the
discipline for the man of ordinary metal. T h e
second, higher than the first, is the Vaishnava
path in which devotion to the Lord, bhakti, plays
a greater role than w o r k s and is meant for a
higher competence. T h i r d , the Shaiva which is
m o r e a path of meditation and jnana, knowledge,
than anything else. These three orders or
successive stages of discipline are meant for the
o r d i n a r y category of seekers, without a n y
special qualification, the pasu, creature w h o is
bound by the bonds of existence, pasa. T h e
fourth is the Dakshina, the path where k a r m a ,
bhakti, jnana are skilfully harmonised and
synthesised; the fruits of the first three a r e
organised and conserved. Higher than the
Dakshina is the Varna, the reverse path w h e r e
the natural turn outwards, pravritti, is turned
inward, nivritti, to the source of all and everything in creation is looked upon and used as the
means for the return to the One Consciousness
that bases all and governs a l l . The process is one
of inner identification of oneself with the One

s o d o a l l p h i l o s o p h i e s get a b s o r b e d i n t h i s
Doctrine.
No doctrine, no path can really compare w i t h
this Sun of Kaula. In other paths great is the
need of travail, struggle, strenuous s t u d y ; but
not so in the Kaula. Here the result is direct
a n d s w i f t . In t h e o t h e r s a y o g i n cannot t a k e t h e
e n j o y m e n t of the w o r l d created by the Divine,

32

KULARNAVA TANTRA

he cannot be a bhogi\ and one w h o is in t h e
m i d s t of the w o r l d cannot be a yogin, an active
aspirant for the Divine.
But here in the path of
the Kaula, both yoga and bhoga, union w i t h the
Divine and participation in His manifestation,
have a h a p p y meet. What is called sin, e v i l , is
turned into a force for good, the v e r y round of
the w o r l d , samsara, becomes a means for release,
bhoga turns into yoga, bhogo yogayate. Even t h e
Gods of the higher w o r l d s l i k e Indra, Rudra,
Brahma f o l l o w this path of Harmony of ShivaShakti, Pure Consciousness and manifesting
Power, w h a t to speak of m e n ! So, should y o u
aspire for Fulfilment, g i v e up a l l other creeds,
a l l other w a y s , and take to the Kula.
But the Kula is not to be had by a n y one and
e v e r y one. There are certain conditions to be
ready before the truth of the Kula could be
revealed. One must have matured in m i n d and
nature as a result of study a n d discipline undergone in the previous l i v e s . O n l y to such a person
does the Knowledge d a w n without being taught
and explained by others.
For one's mind, one's
inclination and proclivity depend entirely upon
w h a t has gone before, w h a t has been prepared
in the past births. According to that preparation,
that evolution, forms the readiness of m a n .
External instruction is of little avail. T h e
second factor is the degree of purification and
subtilisation of consciousness that one has undergone as a result of japa, repetition of sacred
mantras of whatever persuasion.* Third, the
extent to w h i c h one is freed f r o m the deforming

in this Kula Path as w e l l . T h e Kula needs no

its c l a i m to be the highest Sastra. It is open to

the right results accrue.
T h i s felicitous and sure means for liberation, while yet living, is there preserved in the
Kula Sastra which is declared by none other
than the Supreme Lord, Shiva. This is the
Standard, the Law to be followed unquestioningly, without riddling it with doubts. T h e
Sruti stands testimony to the authority and
governance of this Law. T h e Veda is replete
w i t h corroborations of the key-truth of the
K a u l a : an utter consecration of the joy of life,
in its m y r i a d jets, to the Master-Enjoyer, the
Divine.

URDHVAMNAYA AND ITS
GREAT MANTRA*
Eternal and universal is the Lord. So is
His T r u t h eternal and universal. To suit the
different times and different climes in the course
His manifestation, He has promulgated the
Law in varied forms. These are the Great
Traditions, amnayas, sure means of liberation,
spoken by the Lord through His Five Faces,
modes of expression suited to His different
moods of Being.
Facing the East was spoken the Purvaa m n a y a whose central truth is that of creation,
srsti, Path that of Mantra Yoga, and whose
principles are twenty-four in number. Facing
South, was declared the Dakshina-amnaya
whose central truth is the maintenance, sthiti,
of w h a t is created, Path that of Bhakti, and
whose principles are twenty-five in number.
Facing the West was declared the Paschimaamnaya whose central t r u t h is destruction,
samhara, of what has been created and maintained, Path that of Karma, and whose principles are thirty-two in n u m b e r . Facing the
North was declared the Uttara-amnaya whose
central t r u t h is Grace, compassion, Path that of
Jnana, and whose principles are thirty-six in
number. Facing Upward was declared the
highest and the best of all, the Urdhva-amnayat
whose t r u t h is Brahman itself, the Brahman in

its utmost fullness. It is the m o s t guarded
secret teaching. T h e Vedas, Sastras, Puranas
can be m a d e public, but the Shaiva and Shakta
A g a m a s are not to be so done. Of these the
Kula Sastras are more secret and of these again
the most secret is the Urdhva-amnaya. A l l satisfying, it is the most direct f o r m of Shiva
Himself.*
* Some of the Tantras speak of a further, s i x t h ,
Amnaya, the l o w e r and hidden adhamnaya. Citing from
the Devyagama, the Tantra-rahasya s a y s :
" T h e face in

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Each Tradition has its own God-given
Mantras and sub-mantras leading to Enjoyment
and Liberation, bhukti and mukti. The fruit of
each Mantra is granted by the Deity presiding
over that Mantra. And all these Deities that are
adored and waited upon a r e none else but the
emanations, portions of the Lord and his Spouse,
Ishwara and Devi. The t r u t h of all the Mantras
is known to the Lord alone and it is only out of
His grace that man comes to know of it.
Any one of these * Four Amnayas is enough
to lead one to liberation. And if one were to
know all the four he would become the v e r y
Shiva himself. But higher than all the four
Amnayas put together is the Urdhvamnaya
which is so called because it is High, urdhvat
among all the dharmas, because it takes up, h i m
who is below, adhastah urdhvam, because it is
above the nether sea of samsara and because it
can be practised only in a higher way of being,
higher state of consciousness. It is the direct
single means for liberation, yielding a greater
fruit than all the other Amnayas, supreme.
" E v e n as I am to be adored above all others,"
bhairavi, Annapurnabhairavi, Panchami, Shodashi, Malini,
Valavala, with their rites and Mantras.
The sixth face (Below) is lustrous of many colours and
concealed. It is by this mouth that I spoke of Devatasthana,
Asana, Yantra, Mala, Naivedya, Balidana, Sadhana,
Purascharana, Mantrasiddhi. It is called Ishanamnaya."
(Sir John Woodroffe:
Shakti and Shakta)
According to the Niruttara Tantra, the Purva and
Dakshina Amnayas are meant for the Pashu sadhaka, the
Paschima Amnaya for both the Pashu and Vira, the Uttara
Amnaya for both the Vira and the Divya and the Urdhva
Amnaya is for the Divya.
* T h e Purva, Paschima, Dakshina and Uttara Amnayas,

says the Lord, " s o is the Urdhvamnaya to be
cherished above all other A m n a y a s . " " L i k e
Vishnu among the Gods, Surya among the
luminaries, Kashi among places of pilgrimage,
Ganges among the flowing rivers, Meru among
the mountains, Sandal among the trees,
Ashvamedha among the sacrifices, Gem among
stones, sweet among tastes, gold among ores,
cow among the quadruped, swan among birds,
Sannyasa among the Ashramas, Brahmana
among classes, king among men, head among
limbs, m u s k among fragrances, Kanchi among
the cities, Urdhvamnaya is the most excellent
among all the Laws."
One comes to it as a result of merit won in
several births. It is not to be known from Vedas
or Agamas or Sastras or Puranas, however
exhaustive they m a y be; neither by sacrifices,
nor austerities nor visits to pilgrim centres nor
even by means led by Mantras or herbs. It can
be known only through the mouth of the Guru.
Look for h i m , the Guru who knows all, fount of
compassion, endowed with a l l auspicious signs
who knows superbly the T r u t h of the Urdhvaamnaya, then from him receive the Knowledge.
Obtaining full knowledge of the Urdhvamnaya from the Word of the Guru, you shall
attain liberation in this very life according to
the mode of the Scripture. You w i l l be blessed.
Where you live there shall reign Plenty, the
victory of Sri.
The great Mantra presiding over the
Urdhvamnaya is the Sriprasadapara Mantra,
the Hamsa. In this Mantra, the Ha stands for
Shiva, the Purusha, the He and Sa for Shakti,
the Prakritij the She. Both together make the

42

KULARNAVA T A N T R A

Creation and are so present in each form in
creation. Each breath of its life in its outgoing
movement, expiration, spells the Ha, and in its
indrawing movement, inspiration, spells the Sa,
thus automatically repeating * the Mantra of the
truth of its existence.
Hamkarena
bahir yati sahkarena viSet punah
Hamseti

(Niruttara
Tantra)

All life, all pulsation in creation throbs with
this mighty declaration of the biune Truth of
Shiva-Shakti, the eternal He and the eternal She
at play in Manifestation. This Mantra is the
living form of the Shiva-Shakti. From Shiva
down to the worm, the lowest creature, it
pervades the entire creation through the mode
of the Life-force in all living beings, in the form
of inspiration and expiration. Without this
great Mantra-Rhythm the worlds would not be,
even as without wind the cloud cannot be in the
skies. All this Creation, mobile and immobile,
is textured by this great Mantra; it is inseparable from the Mantra like air from the fan.
Like sprout in the seed, oil in the seasamum,
heat in the fire, light in the sun, moonlight in the
moon, fire in the wood, fragrance in the flower,

moisture in the water, meaning in the word,
Shakti in Shiva, butter in milk, taste in fruit,
sweet in sugar, cold in camphor, like grace and
control in the Mantra, deity in idol, reflection in
the m i r r o r , movement in the wind, is the
universe situate in the great Prasadamantra*
As the tree exists subtly in the fig-seed, the
whole Brahmanda (creation of Brahman) is held
in the great Mantra. Just as even things
excellently cooked and juicy are not tasty
without salt, so too Mantras that are not
conjoined w i t h this great Mantra do not yield
fruit, as they are devoid of their own potency.
Bewildered by the great Maya, even the gods
wander without direction in the maze of the
varied Sastras. But he who develops firm faith
and devotion in the Guru, who is but the Lord's
own form, and knows this great Prasadaparamantra from him, gets sure release. For this,
indeed, he should have done the Mantras of the
several paths of the Four Amnayas \in his
previous births and matured to wait upon the
command of the Guru. He is free from the
cloak of sin, pure of soul, dear to the Guru and
gets to know the great Mantra from the Guru.
Gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra,
Guardians of the Quarters like Vasus, Rudras,
Manu, Moon etc., Munis like Markandeya,
Vasishtha, masters of Yoga like Sanaka, liberated
beings like Shuka, inhabitants of the higher
worlds like Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas,
Siddhas, Vidyadharas have attained to the fruit
of this Mantra and repeat it even today. To
him who repeats this Mantra comes capacity,
reverence, knowledge, lustre, happiness, freedom
from disease, kingdom, heaven, liberation; he

44

KULARNAVA T A N T R A

surpasses the very gods. Though he m a y do no
ritual, the knower of this Mantra, walks a happy
path which not all the followers of Dharma can
hope for. By the repetition of this Mantra,
paraprasada
Mantra, the pasu becomes the
pasupati, the creature becomes the Lord. He
who knows the truth of this Mantra comes to
know the truth of both Shiva and Shakti. Even
a l o w l y man, if he knows this Mantra, can
instal the Deity in images and the like. Whatever the knower of this Mantra does, wishes,
speaks, that becomes tapas, dhyana, japa.
" W h o e v e r knows this Paraprasada Mantra,"
says the Lord, " l o a d e d with the tradition and
received through Initiation, he becomes Myself."
*'All these worlds, fourteen in number*, w i t h
all that is mobile and immobile, are stationed in
the body of this Mantra. T h e place where such
a knower stands becomes a holy centre up to the
distance of ten Yojanas. T h e r e is no distinction
of class with this Mantra. Whoever repeats it,
whatever his class, whatever his state, he gets
liberated. Whether done while walking or
standing, waking or dreaming, it is not without
fruit. Thousands are the Mantras which have

T h e One Truth, formless, beyond the reach
of thought, the Para Brahman, Eternal, void of
parts, void of taint, void of attribute, like Ether,
Infinite, Imperishable, Inaccessible to mind and
speech, shines forth in the conjunction of the
Great Mantra and its profound meaning.
This, then, is the crest-jewel of all Mantras,
being a form of the Supreme Reality, standing
for Sacchidananda, constituted of Shiva and
Shakti, yielding both Enjoyment and Liberation,
with and yet without Works, with and yet
without Guna (attribute), - this is the supreme
Mantra by repeating which man obtains
Fulfilment without fail.
This is the one Mantra without peer. This is
the supreme knowledge, this the supreme Tapas,
this the supreme Dhyana, this the supreme Worship, this the supreme Diksha, this the supreme

Great Mantra and be ever dedicated to it.
Following the order laid down by the Agamas,
beginning with the prescribed way of worship,
repeat Sriparaprasada Mantra a hundred and
eight times.
T h e more you repeat this Mantra the more
extended are the fruits, temporal and spiritual.
Therefore with entire effort, in all conditions,
at a l l times, must you repeat the Sri Prasada
Para Mantra.
It is called prasada because it wins the
benign Grace anon, prasadakaranat; it is called
para because it is above a l l other mantras,
parattvat

The Rishi of this
Mantra is the Supreme Shiva Himself, the Metre
is Gayatri which manifests the Unmanifest, the
Deity is She who is the Supreme Sovereign of all
Mantras.
T h e r e is no truth higher than the Guru, no
Godhead greater than Shiva, no Science greater
than the Veda, no Philosophy equal to the
Kaula, no Knowledge greater than the Kula, no
happiness greater than Jnana, no worship
greater than the Puja of eight limbs, no fruit
greater than Mukti. And Mukti, par excellance,
is obtained swiftly and directly by the Grace of
the Sriprasadapara Mantra. This is the truth,
the sole truth, the indubitable truth.

THE FIVE M'S AND THEIR
FULL SIGNIFICANCE*
The ingredients to be used in the worship of
the Devi a r e of many kinds. These comprise,
in the Kaulachara, madya, wine, mamsa, meat,
matsya, fish, mudra, grain, maithuna, woman,
well known as the Five M's, panca makaras
(each i t e m beginning with ma). The Sastra
prescribes in meticulous detail, the types of
vessels to be used on different occasions, the
metal or substance of which they are made,
their dimensions; the several kinds of grain, the
proportion of their mixing and the manner of
their cooking; the preparation of different kinds
of wine from different substances according to
different formulas. Wine here is primarily
used as an agent for the release of the senses
from their engrossment in their outer objects.
The surface faculties and sensibilities constantly
exposed to the shocks and occupations of everyday life a r e temporarily suspended and the
deeper, the larger, the subliminal ranges of
consciousness are opened up making it easier
for the practicant to get a hold in the inner
recesses and work for the culture and the purification of the being. It is a means, says the
Kularnava, for the purification of the mind and
consciousness,

relaxation into the folds of a lighter and larger
consciousness that sees and feels less constrictedly, more universally, is the immediate result
of the correct ritual of wine.
Wine is not to be taken as wine nor flesh as
flesh; nor is it permissible to partake in the
ceremonies as a mere h u m a n a n i m a l ridden
with greed and desire. T h e Wine is the Shakti,
the Divine Dynamism, Flesh the Shiva, the
Divine Substance, and he w h o partakes is none
other than Bhairava himself, the Divine Enjoyer.
The bliss, Ananda that arises when all these
three a r e fused in the consciousness of the
practicant is real release, moksa. Ananda is the
intimate form of Brahman and it is there
installed in each individual b o d y ; wine brings
out, releases into manifestation this indwelling
Bliss. T h i s is the reason w h y yogins take in the
sanctified wine.
T h e r e a r e conditions to be fulfilled before
one is fit to take this wine. One must be free
from all doubt, free from fear, brave of spirit,
above dualities, above curiosity, one must have
arrived at a definite and conclusive understanding of the wisdom of the Scripture. In such a
person alone the partaking of wine, processed
and sanctified by the charge of the Mantra,
awakens the sense of godhood which unties the
knots of life.
To be otherwise, to do otherwise, is simply
to be drunk. Worship the Gods and the Manes
in full accord with the prescribed way of the
Scripture, remember the Guru and dedicate
before partaking of the meat and the wine.
Wine is to be received only for the benefit of the
Gods who claim the Enjoyment and for steady4949 - 4

Wine, says another Tantra, should be taken
only as long as the mind r e m a i n s merged in the

Deity (yavat syan manolayah). The Mahanirvana
lays it down that wine is to be taken only as
long as the mind is not shaken and the sight is
not affected. To drink more is to drink animally.
Completely free from greed or desire in
yourself, with love make the Deity partake,
prasayet, make Her drink, not drink it yourself.
Partaking of these ingredients, says the Tantra,
at a n y other time except on this holy occasion
of dedication and worship is condemnable.
Then, in a significant passage, the text
declares that just as the partaking of Soma is
enjoined upon the Wise in the Sacrifices of the
Veda, so is Wine to be partaken on these
occasions (of worship), Wine that gives both
bliss and release. Now, Soma in the Vedic
context means, as all know, not merely the
juice extracted from the plant of that name. It
is that only externally. T h e sap that is extracted from the plant and offered to the God is only
a symbol and an outer figure for the delight of
all life-experience distilled by the soul of the
Yajamana. and offered to the Divine for its
acceptance as the acme of its consecration. Like
Soma of the Veda is the Wine of the Tantra. It
is something within, the flow of delight that

but if in practice he is given to these objects, he
is indeed condemnable.
In a crowning peroration of memorable
import, the Kularnava declares unequivocally:
F r o m the Muladhara at the base go up again
and again to the Brahmarandhra at the crown;
bliss issues out of this meet of the Kundali
Shakti and the Moon of Pure-Consciousness.
What flows from this Lotus in the supreme
Ether above is the wine, this is the real wine to
be tasted by m a n ; what is drunk otherwise is
only liquor.
T h e animal that is killed is the notion of
good and bad, merit and demerit, the animal of
duality which is cut asunder by the knower of
yoga w i t h the sword of knowledge. And the
consciousness so freed is merged in the supreme.
This is the true eating of meat.
T h e host of the senses must be brought
under the mind's control and yoked to the self;
this is the true eating of fish. The others
merely hurt the creatures.
And the woman to be waited upon is none
other than the inner Shakti that is lying asleep
in the ordinary animal man and is awake in the
Kaula.* This is the ' S h a k t i ' to be served,
attended to. The rush of Ananda that ensues on
the meeting of this Divine Pair, the Supreme
Shakti and the Supreme Self, the Lord t h a t
waits above, that is the real maithuna, the final
ma. Anything other is only copulation.
This, then, is the yogic, and we shall say,
the ultimate meaning of the Five M's. T h i s
is the sense in which the highest class of

Shakta worshippers understand the five components of this ritual and take steps to realise
them progressively in practice. In the Tantra,
the worshippers are, it is well known, divided
into three broad categories of pasu, animal man,
vira, the heroic man, divya, the godly man*. To
each of these classes of seekers, it should be
mentioned, the Five ingredients have different
connotations: divyatattva, the divine or symbolic
meaning for the divya sadhaka†; pratyaksa tattva,
literal, to the Vira who is constitutionally and
temperamentally equipped to ride on the crest
of Nature, subjugating and transforming her in
the course of his sadhana and fulfils the onerous
* T h e r e are further gradations l e a d i n g from one class
to another e.g. svabhava vira, vibhava v i r a , mantrasiddha
vira etc.
† T h e m e a n i n g m a y vary from text t o text, but e v e r y w h e r e it is in the y o g i c sense. For instance, Wine is the
nectarous stream that flows f r o m the Brahmarandhra
(Agamasara)
or the high k n o w l e d g e of Brahman in w h i c h
the sense of the external world is lost (Kaula tantra)
Meat (mansa) is speech (amsa, portion of ma, tongue) w h i c h
is ' e a t e n ' i . e . c o n t r o l l e d ; or it means the dedication of
a l l action to the Lord, ' M a m . ' . F i s h (matsya) are the t w o
fishes m o v i n g in Ganga and Yamuna i . e . the t w o currents
of breath, e x p i r a t i o n and inspiration, constantly m o v i n g
in Ida and the Pingala; they are eaten i.e. controlled by
psycho-physical disciplines l i k e P r a n a y a m a ; or it means
refined k n o w l e d g e by w h i c h through the feeling or ' M i n e '
mat one identifies oneself w i t h the u n i v e r s a l l i f e . Mudra
is the k n o w l e d g e of the l u m i n o u s Atman, Self, in the
thousand petalled Lotus a b o v e ; or it means abondonment
of one's participation in e v i l that goes to bind. Maithuna
is the b l i s s onjoyed by the sadhaka in identification w i t h
the Atman in the Sahasrara; or it is the union of the
Kundalini Shakti in the Muladhara of our being w i t h the
Shiva in the Sahasrara.

conditions laid down by the Sastra. To one who
is neither a divya nor a vira but is on the lowest
rung of the ladder, pasu, Panchatattvas a r e
substitutional, anukalpatattva. Instead of wine
they use coconut water, instead of meat, garlic
and so on*. T h e Mahanirvana T a n t r a lays it
down:
When the Kali age is in full sway, in the
case of the householder whose mind is entirely
engrossed with domestic desires, the three
sweets should be substituted in the place of the
first element of worship. Milk, sugar and
honey are the three sweets T h e y should be
deemed to be the image of wine, and as such
offered to the Deity. Those born in Kali age are
by their n a t u r e weak in intellect, and their
minds are distracted by lust. By reason of this,
they do not recognise the Shakti to be the image
of the Deity. Therefore, O Parvati, for such as
these let there be, in place of the last element of
worship, meditation upon the Lotus-Feet of
the Devi and the inward recitation of their
istamantra. (VIII. 171-174)

* Here too the items to be substituted may differ from
Tantra to T a n t r a but everywhere care is taken to see that
they are harmless ingredients. Coconut water or m i l k for
w i n e ; salt, ginger, sesamum, wheat or garlic for meat,
brinjal, radish or paniphala for fish; paddy, rice or wheat
for Mudra; offering of flowers with hands in a prescribed
mudra, joining of particular flowers in dedication etc. for
maithuna.

CHAPTER V

REQUIREMENT OF WORSHIP*
It is not everyone who can take to the
worship of the Deity. To make offerings to the
Deity, to summon Her to accept what is
proffered, to receive Her in a fitting manner and
adore Her pleasingly, requires a preparation,
outer and inner, worked out in the present life or
the past. One who is so competent is fully
initiated, knows the truth of the knowledge
embodied in the Scripture. He is full of devotion
for the Guru, and for the Deity. And he has
control over himself, well-regulated in his life.
The mysteries of the Agamas, which are not all
openly declared in the Sastras, are known to
him. He is full of fervour for worship. Worship shall not be done as a routine or as a part
of discipline. He who would t r u l y worship
looks forward to the adoration with eagerness,
with joy. And when he worsh.ips he is alive
with the instruction of the Guru for it is the
Guru who puts him in contact w i t h the Deity and
to be conscious of his instruction is to enliven the
link forged by him. Pure of heart, superbly
joyous, devoid of anger and unsteadiness, rejecting the inferior ritual, cheerful of countenance,
he worships. He offers and adores with devotion.
Devotion does not come or grow in day. Even
when it is intense it does not last. True and
lasting devotion sprouts after a long period of
self-effectuation and particularly by the Grace
* Ullasa 6

56

KULARNAVA TANTRA

of the Divine. It is then that offerings made
according to the instruction of the Guru, to the
accompaniment of proper Mantras, reach their
destination. It is then that the worship of the
Great Sri Chakra, Abode of the mighty Puissance
of the Divine Mother, can be performed effectively by means of Mantra-Yoga. Not merely
chanting of Mantras, but by yoga of mantra
i.e. by a deep identification w i t h the soul of
the Mantra that is repeated. Such worship, says
the Lord, He accepts with distinction along with
Her. And when the worshipper enters into the
Ritual, he must realise and come into a state of
consciousness that feels divine. To t r u l y
commune with the Divine and to offer oneself to
the Divine, one must become a w a r e of one's own
state of divinity. Such a worshipper attains
Fulfilment as well as Release.
Worship must be performed in a place which
is free from distractions and disturbances, free
from crowd. The worshipper shall seat himself
in a happy position which gives stability to the
body and face either east or north.
Prior to
beginning the ceremony he shall, with an unagitated mind, visualise himself seated in the
jewelled abode of the Divine Mother in the
Ocean of Immortality w i t h all the high
paraphernalia required for the worship and
perform the Puja according to the command of
the Guru.
Before proceeding to the worship, however,
there is an indispensable process of purification
which is fivefold in character; purification of
oneself, purification of the place, purification of
the materials used, purification of the Mantras
and purification of the Deity. Purification of

REQUIREMENT OF WORSHIP

57

oneself is both outer and i n n e r ; the outer bybath and the inner by the purification of the
elements, bhutasuddhi, by p r a n a y a m a and nyasa
and other prescribed methods. T h e place of
worship is sanctified by cleaning, wiping,
anointing into a shine of the m i r r o r , decoration
with flowers, incense, camphor, lights and
colours. The substances used for worship shall
be purified by prescribed methods of sprinkling
with sanctified water reciting the Mantras,
with mudra etc. The Mantras that are used are
to be purified* by appropriate means. And
lastly, the Deity to be worshipped is also to be
purified, by placing it on the seat, making it
whole, i.e. by invoking the life of the Deity into
it, sprinkling w i t h sanctified w a t e r along with
recital of the Mulamantra, performance of nyasa
etc. in the prescribed manner. Adorning it with
ornaments, offering of incense, lights etc. follow
afterwards.
After this elaborate and comprehensive
purification, attention should be paid to the
drawing of the significant circles, mandalas,
the proper placement and utilisation of the
various substances, singly and in combination;
the various cosmic Powers are invoked and the
prescribed Mantras repeated in their due order
with sacred deference. The fraternity of the
Gurus † is to be invoked. And after sanctifying
* Purification, of the Mantra is the performance of Japa
of the letters of the alphabet w h i c h compose the Matrikamantra, once in t h e i r regular order, and once again in the
opposite, by l i n k i n g the letters of the Mulamantra w i t h
them.
† T h e Gurus are classified into three g r a d e s : divyaugha,
the celestial order, siddhaugha, the perfected order,

58

KULARNAVA T A N T R A

the seat the Deity is called. She who dwells in
the cluster of Lotuses, Who is the Form of
Causal Delight, ever active for the good of all,
the Divine Mother is fervently called into
coming and beseeched to stay as long as the
worship is in progress. And the worship is
offered with an exclusive concentration.
T h e Divine, say the philosophies, is really
without form, without any features. Then how
is it, it m a y be asked, that It is enjoined to be
worshipped in so many kinds of form and
lauded in Its features in the various scriptures?
The Agama gives the answer.
T h e Brahman is indeed the Immeasurable,
the Impersonal, without attribute, a sheer
Consciousness. Yet for the benefit of the aspiring, of those who seek for It, Brahman assumes
forms, determines Itself in a way as to be
cognisable and accessible. It takes Form but
certainly It is not limited by that Form or any
number of Forms. Thus, though the Supreme
manavaugha, the human order. T h e 6rst, the d i v i n e order,
consists of Adinatha and His Shakti, Sadasiva and h i s
consort, Ishwara and his consort, Rudra and his consort,
Vishnu and h i s beloved, Brahma and h i s w i f e - in a l l
twelve.
In the second, the order of t h e Siddhas - those w h o have
arrived at perfection and are e t e r n a l l y present and active are Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata,
Ribhukshaja, Dattatreya, Raivataka, Vamadeva, Vyasa,
Shuka - e l e v e n of t h e m .
T h e third, the ordinary, is of gods w h o apparently
occupy a subordinate position in this s c h e m e : Narasimha,
Mahesha, Bhaskara, Mahendra, Madhava, Vishnu - in a l l
six.
According to some other s c h o o l s , this manavaugha,
human order of Gurus, consists of the h u m a n Guru, Maha
Guru, Parama Guru, Parapara Guru etc.

REQUIREMENT OF WORSHIP

59

Deity is not determined or limited by Form,
She reveals Herself in m a n y forms. The
worshipper visualises the Formless One in
Form and adores Her in the linga, sign-symbol,
altar, Fire, Water, winnowing fan, wall, sheet,
Mandala (diagram), plank, in the head or in the
heart.
Just as though milk is formed from the
constituents all over the body of the cow, it
flows out only through the teats of its udder,
similarly the Divine who is all pervading shines
specially resplendent in Images and the like.
The Presence of the Divine in the Form is determined in its intensity by the appropriateness of
that Form, specially of the worship offered and
by the faith of the worshipper. Cream, as long
as it lies in the body of the cow, does not nourish
anyone. But when it is collected, treated and
used, it does promote nourishment. T h e Divine
is likewise there spread in each b o d y ; but without proper adoration and evocation, upasana, it
does not yield fruit to man.
All the pranas of the Deity a r e to be summoned together, the limbs enlivened, all installed in the Image and then is the live Deity to be
worshipped. Otherwise worship is fruitless.
There m a y be defect of Mantra, defect of ritual,
defect of process; still if this installation is
done in the proper manner, the worship bears
fruit.
If there be transgression of r u l e there is no
fruit. Neither there should be allowed defect of
excess or defect of want. Only when things are
done according to the requirements laid down
that Japa, Homa, Puja etc. become acceptable to
the Deity and therefore fruitful.

60

KULARNAVA TANTRA

If worship be offered without an active
consciousness that the Divine is there in the
form of the Mantra and pervades through the
Mantra, it is useless. The Yantra is declared
to be ensouled by Mantra and the deity is in the
form of Mantra. Worshipped in the Yantra,
She is indeed instantly pleased. And why is
this form called yantra? Because it regulates,
subdues, niyantrana, all misery arising from
desire, anger and other failings. As the body is
to the jiva, soul, as oil is to the lamp, the
Yantra is the established seat of all the Deities.
Therefore draw the Yantra, meditate upon Her
auspicious form, know everything from the
mouth of the Guru and worship according to
rule. If worship be done without proper Yantra
then it can only entail the curse of the Deity.
Each Deity is to be carefully installed in its own
Yantra and worshipped with all its paraphernalia. Should you be absent-minded, call one
Deity and worship another, you shall receive
the curses of both. Each Deity is to be received
with the honour that belongs" to it, with the
Mantra that is proper to its order. The inner
soul-force, antahsakti, shall be roused to its full
potential and dedicated to the Deity through the
several movements of the worship.
It is only when all these requirements are
learnt from the Guru and worship offered in
accordance with the rule, that the Deity is
pleased. The Puja must be full in its limbs and
full in its duration.

CHAPTER VI

YOGA*
Yoga is the main process. T h e T a n t r a seeks
to weave it into every detail of life, give a
different meaning to each of man's activities by
making all of them means for the effectuation
and expression of the inner yoga of progression
from the h u m a n into the divine.
And of yoga, dhyana, meditation, is an
important l i m b . Dhyana is of two kinds, gross
and subtle. When the meditation is upon a
Form, it is the gross, and when it is without
Form, the subtle. The grosser kind of meditation with F o r m is resorted to when the mind is
very unsteady and needs to be given a prop, a
concrete object on which to fix itself so that it
may not wander away. But the object of both
the gross and subtle kinds of Dhyana is the
s a m e : steadiness, immobility of mind.
When the Divine is conceived with form,
it is contemplated upon in its several limbs, feet,
hands etc., in the prescribed manner. When
it is conceived as without form, it is contemplated upon as the Sacchidananda, allluminous, without parts. It neither rises nor
sets, neither waxes nor wanes, it shines by itself
and enshines others without effort. Infinite,
formed in Light, not perceivable to the eye but
simply existent, it can only be felt, become
aware of by the mind. Knowledge of That is
Brahman.
* Ullasa 9

62

KULARNAVA TANTRA

And he whose movement of life-breath
is arrested, who is immobile like the stone,
knowing only the supreme Self and Abode is
called the yogi who knows yoga. Where there
is not even awareness, w h e r e it is still like
blocked water, that Dhyana devoid of Form is
called Samadhi. The Reality shines by itself,
not by mental thinking. And when the Reality
so shines on its own, one instantly becomes
That Itself. He who is as if asleep whether in
the condition of dream or of waking, neither
breathing in nor breathing out, immobile, he is
t r u l y freed. Whose senses a r e without stir,
whose mind and breath are absorbed in his self,
who is like one dead, he is called the Jivanmukta,
liberated while yet living. He neither hears nor
smells nor touches nor sees, neither he knows
pleasure and pain, neither he exercises the
mind. Like a log of wood, he cognises nothing
nor is a w a r e of anything; he is only absorbed in
Shiva, he is in samadhi. As w i t h water thrown
into water, milk into milk, ghee into ghee, no
difference remains, similarly no difference there
remains
between
the
jivatma and the
Paramatma, the soul and the Lord. Even as the
insect becomes a bee by force of concentration,
so can man become Brahman by dint of samadhi.
And once the self is separated from the gunas,
it is never the same again, just as butter
extracted from milk even when thrown again
into the milk does not get into the old state.
Just as one in heavy darkness sees nothing,
so indeed the yogin sees not the world which
does not hold his attention. This is the true sign
of Dhyana: as one does not see the world of
objects when the eyes are closed, so even when

YOGA

63

they are open, the world is not seen. He who
knows the Brahman is aware of this worldmovement only in the manner of men being
conscious of some itching on their bodies.
Of him who has known the supreme Reality,
above forms, above change, the very Mantras
with their presiding Deities become the servitors.
Of him who is founded in the sole consciousness
of the Self, every movement is worship, each
utterance is verily a mantra, each gaze is
meditation.* When identification with the body
is gone and the supreme Self is known, wherever
the mind moves there it is samadhi.
When the supreme Self is beheld, cut asunder
is the key-knot, hrdaya-granthi, that rivets all
involvements in the many strands of n a t u r e ;
shorn are all doubts, doubts of higher possibilities or of the veracity of the scriptures or
utterances of the J n a n i n s ; all karma, legacy of
past action, dwindles away. When the masteryogin attains to this pure and supreme State, he
cares not for the status of the gods or of the
mighty Asuras. To him who sees the Allpervading, Peaceful, Blissful, Imperishable,
what can r e m a i n still to be attained or still to be
known? When knowledge and super-knowledge
are attained, when what is to be known is there
alive in the heart and when the state of Peace is
attained, neither yoga nor dharana, concentra* " M a y T h o u be pleased to accept my prattlings as

Images; but for those who know the Self, He is
indeed everywhere*.
He w h o stands equal-minded in censure and
praise, in cold and in warmth, among foes and
among friends, he is the master of yoga, devoid
of either exuberance or depression. The yogi,
knower of the supreme Truth, dwells in the
body like a wayfarer, devoid of desire, evercontent, equal-eyed, master of the senses. He is
the yogi, knower of the high T r u t h , who is
•without volition, without doubts, without taint
of associations or impressions, absorbed ever in
T r u t h of his own Reality. The yogi, knower
of truth, lives like the lame, the blind, the deaf,
the impotent, the ebrious, the dull.
Buoyed up on the Bliss supreme ensuing
from the fivefold worship, he is the master of
yoga, beholding his Self within himself. For
those who know how to derive the essential rasa
of the five constituents of worship, they yield
release; but for those who do not know and yet
resort to them, they are verily means of perdition. He is the real Kula-yogi who in the midst
of these five elements of worship, is constantly
concentrated on the Feet of the Guru, always
free from mental lapses. Freely partaking of
them all, yet fully and ever conscious of the
identity of himself with the Supreme, he lives
contented in that awareness.
Values are totally changed in the path of the
Kula. What is rejected in the ordinary world
is cherished h e r e ; what is valued there is
rejected here. Considerations of men in the

YOGA

67

world do not apply to the Kaula whose goal is
different and path still more different. Neither
injunctions of acceptance nor of rejection, neither
merit nor demerit, neither heaven nor hell
exists for the Kaula In this Path the ignorant
grow wise; the poor grow w e a l t h y ; the decayed
progress; enemies become friendly; the very
kings become attendants; all befriend the Kaula.
Those who t u r n away come to greet, the proud
bow down to him. Obstructors become allies.
Bad qualities t u r n good, what is not kindred
grows k i n d r e d ; what is contrary to the Dharma
becomes Dharma The very death becomes a
helping physician, the home becomes a veritable
heaven. What the Kula yogi wills, that comes
to be.
A Kula Yogi m a y dwell anywhere, disguised
in any form, unknown to anybody. Such yogins,
in diverse guises, intent on the welfare of men,
walk the earth unrecognised by others. They
do not expend their self-knowledge at once. In
the midst of men they live as if intoxicated,
dumb, dull. T h e mode of yogins is not easily
perceivable like the stars and the planets in the
skies when there is the sun or the moon. The
mode of the yogins is not seen like the movement of the birds in the skies or of aquatics in
the water. Adepts in Kaula yoga speak in the
manner of the uncivil, behave as if ignorant;
appear like the lowly. T h e y do so in order
that men m a y ignore them and not flock to
t h e m ; they talk nothing at all. Though realised
in freedom, the yogi will sport like a child;
may conduct himself like a d u l l a r d ; talk like
one intoxicated. Such a yogi lives in a way
that this world of men may laugh, feel disgust,

68

KULARNAVA TANTRA

revile and seeing, pass at a distance leaving h i m
alone He would go about in different guises,
at times like one worthy, at times like one
fallen, at times like a ghost or demon. If the
yogi accepts things of life it is for the good of
the world and not out of desire. Out of compassion for all men, he will sport on the earth.
Like the sun who dries up everything, like
Agni who consumes everything, the yogi takes
all to himself, but is not tainted by any sin.
Like the Wind which touches everything, like
the sky which spreads everywhere, like all who
bathe in the rivers, the yogi is ever pure. As
water of the township gets pure when it reaches
the river, so too things from the lowly become
pure once they reach the hands of the yogi.
To the wise who seek their higher good,
the ways of the adepts in the Kaula Knowledge
are, verily, the honoured. What the masters
of yoga tread that is the supreme Path; where
the sun rises there is the East. Just as where
the elephant walks is formed the path, similarly
where the Kula yogi treads there is the Path.
Who can hope to make straight the winding
course of the river or to arrest its flood? Who
can deter the man in Peace who sports as he
wills?
Even as the charmer is not stung by the
snakes he plays with, the Jnanin playing w i t h
the serpents of senses is not harmed. Away
from misery, contented, devoid of dualities,
free from jealousy, given to Kaula Knowledge,
peaceful, the Kaulas are always devoted to the
Divine. Without insolence, anger, show, desire
and ego, truthful in speech, not enslaved to the
senses, the masters of the Kaula Path are not

YOGA

69

fickle. When the T r u t h of the Kula is lauded,
their hair stands on end, their voice shakes with
emotion and tears of joy drop d o w n ; they are
the best of the Kaulikas. They have the conviction that the Kula Dharma born of Shiva is
superior to all d h a r m a s ; such are best among
the Kaulas. He who knows the truth of the
Kula, who is proficient in the Science of the
Kula, who is engaged in the worship of the
Kula, he alone is the Kaulika and no other.
He becomes pleased on meeting devotees of the
Kula, knowers of Kula, traditions and observances of K u l a ; he is the Kaulika, dear to
Shiva.
By initiation, diksa, shall one be a Kaula,
knower of the three tattvas, the Feet supreme
and the meaning of the basic, mula, Mantra,
devoted to the Deity and the Guru. T h e teacher
of the Kaula Path is difficult to get; he is
obtained only by a happy ripening of previous
merit. The intensive practicant of the Kula
Dharma, howsoever low may be his station in
life, purifies instantly if only he is remembered or lauded or seen or bowed to or conversed
with.
" W h e t h e r he is an all-knower or a fool,
whether he is the best or the lowest, if he be a
knower of the Kula, where he is, there I am with
Thee (Devi). I dwell not in Kailas nor in Meru
nor in Mandara; I dwell w h e r e dwell the
knowers of Kula. Even if such men of the Lord
be far, there must one r e p a i r ; they must be seen
with effort; because there, indeed, I a m . The
Teacher of the Kula must be met even if he be
very far; but not the animal man even if he be
very near. Where the knower of Kula lives that

70

KULARNAVA TANTRA

place is sanctified. By his sight and by h i s
worship thrice seven generations are uplifted.
When they see a Kula-Jnanin in their progeny
the ancestors rejoice saying ' we shall attain to
the supreme state.' Like the tillers for plenteous
rains, the ancestors always look forward for
a Kaulika in their family, either as a son
or a grandson. He indeed is blessed in t h i s
world, freed from sin, w h o m the masters
of Kula approach with pleasure. When t h e
master of the Kaulikas is at hand, yogins and
yoginis flock happily to his dwelling. The very
ancestors w a i t upon t h e m ; therefore are t h e
adepts in the Kula-knowledge to be worshipped
with devotion. If after worshipping Thee,
O Devi, the devotees are not worshipped, the
sinners w h o do so do not qualify for Thy Grace.
When the offerings are placed before Thee, thou
acceptest t h e m by mere sight; I take their sap
from the tongue of the devotee. Worship of T h y
devotees is my w o r s h i p ; therefore he who seeks
my favour shall worship T h y devotees alone.
What is done for the Kaulas is done for the gods;
for the gods are all fond of K u l a s ; so worship
the Kaula. Nowhere am I so pleased as there
where the master of Kula is worshipped well.
The fruit that is obtained by the worship of the
Kaula is not to be had by pilgrimages, tapas,
gifts or observances. Whatever a kaula may
give, donate, sacrifice, however he may do
penance or worship or repeat by w a y of Japa, it
is useless if the Kula Teacher is disregarded.
He who enters the Kuladharma and yet does not
know the w a y of the Kula, his house is verily a
burial ground, he a sinner, cooker of kine.
Gifts made to those other than votaries of

YOGA

71

the Kula are fruitless like water in a broken jar,
seeds sown on rock, ghee poured in ashes What
is given according to one's capacity to the
Kulayogin, w i t h feeling, on special occasions,
that is superbly fruitful. When the Wise in the
Kula are called on special days, worshipped in
devotion w i t h godly reverence w i t h sandal
paste, flower and the five gladdening mudras,
and they are pleased, I am pleased and all the
gods are pleased."
Therefore with all effort, in all conditions,
always be devoted to the Kula Dharma worship
those who a r e knowers of the Kula Whether
you are learned or not learned, as long as you
hold the body, the way laid down for your
station in life shall be worked out for release
from karma; when ignorance is thus destroyed
by prescribed action, you attain by knowledge
to the state of Shiva and in Shiva you get the
release. Therefore resort to the prescribed
action Do actions which are free from blemish,
works that are enjoined for daily performance;
released by that action, aspiring for happiness,
devoted to works, live happily. It is not possible
to give up all activity for one who bears the
b o d y ; therefore abandon the fruit of action and
be a true renouncer. Organs engage themselves
in their functions - understanding this, leave
aside the ego-feeling; actions so done do not
taint. Actions done after attainment of Knowledge do not touch like water a lotus leaf. Of
one settled in that knowledge a l l acts of merit
or demerit dwindle away, they do not taint;
neither do those that are done again. Given to
natural joy that ensues and to the Knowledge of
the Truth, having given up all volitions, the

72

KULARNAVA TANTRA

wise one should forsake all action that binds.
Merely to give up the scheme of prescribed
works (without this knowledge) is conceit of the
ignorant. Just as after attaining fruit the tree
throws a w a y the flower indifferently, the yogin
attaining to the Truth, gives up the paraphernalia of works. Those who are one in their core
with the Brahman are not tainted by any kind of
merit or demerit.

CHAPTER VII

WORSHIP*
Worship, puja, individual and collective,
plays a central part in the life of the Kaula.
There are different rituals for daily worship,
for the fortnightly and the monthly sessions.
Special rituals are prescribed for special occasions like the days of religious festivals, birthdays of one's own, of the Guru, the Parama
Guru etc. All are to be observed to the best of
one's ability, one's resources, the circumstances,
the times, the customs. In the selection,
assemblage and utilisation of the ingredients of
worship, the utmost care is to be exercised.
Much more than the material side of the
worship, the upasaka has to be careful of his
psychological state of mind and soul. Especially
in the worship w i t h the Five M's, it is laid down
that they are to be used as prescribed purely for
the delectation of the Deity; if desire creeps in
then it becomes a sinful act. T h e worshipper
shall bow down to the woman, who is to be
worshipped in certain rituals - m a r k that she
may be of any age from one year onwards for
purposes of worship of the maiden, kumari
puja - as a deity, devata buddhya. The Deity is to
be first invoked in her and then the worship
proceeded with, w i t h a mind free from, impurity,
nirvikarena cetasa. At the best, the worshipper
himself must rise in his consciousness to the
status of a god - devata-bhavam-asthitah.
* Ullasas 10, 11.

74

KULARNAVA TANTRA

The Yantra is an essential part of the Kaula
worship and without a proper Yantra the Deityis not pleased to be present. And where worship
is offered according to the scripture, the Lord
himself w i t h the Devi is present. Millions are
the attendants charged by Him with the protection of the Kula Dharma and of those who adhere
to it. T h e y are ever pleased when they are
remembered and given their due in worship.
Some of them, the major deities, are to be
invoked in the prescribed forms and worshipped.
Before entering the r i t u a l of worship the
initiate shall cleanse himself w i t h purificatory
bath. He shall seat himself in the prescribed
manner and abstain from loose unconnected
talk. He shall not eat before-hand. He shall
not lack in devotion and shall not be tainted
with greed in any form. He shall not offer
worship in the presence of one who is not
qualified to participate in the r i t u a l i.e. the
pasu, the man still in the a n i m a l stage as he is
not sufficiently purified in mind and soul.
It makes a big difference in the Kaula
worship whether the worshipper is an enlightened person in the ways of Knowledge or
he is an ignorant man. T h e wise, says the
Tantra, intoxicated with the spirit of the ritual,
do japa, meditate, praise, prostrate, instruct,
query, delight themselves during the sessions.
But the ignorant wander, roar, laugh, argue,
weep, desire for sex and cavil. Slight, garrulousness, argumentation without logic, indifference, fear, anger, these are to be avoided in
the Circle of Puja. No quarter shall be given to
egotism. All are eligible to respect in the eyes
of the true Kaula. Nobody shall claim superio-

WORSHIP

75

rity over others saying he is the Guru or he is
the elder.
Pay due respect to the recognised Guru
perform his worship on suitable occasions.
Do not take his name except at the time of Japa.
Observe proper secrecy regarding the instruction of the Guru, regarding the Mantra that is
given to you. Receive full instruction in line
with the age-old tradition from the person of
the Guru and do not speak of it to the unqualified. Speak not to the lowly, neither hear from
any such
Pay respect to womankind, as they are all
born of the family of the Divine Mother Punish
them not in however mild a manner, whatever
the transgression. Their excellences, not failings,
are to be stressed.
Guard the core of this Kula Dharma from
the profane, like wealth of gold and corn from
the brigands. Be a Kaula (worshipper of the
Sovereign Shakti) w i t h i n ; appear a Shaiva
(votary of Shiva) without; but among men in
society pass for a Vaishnava (bard of God
Vishnu). Like the water within the shell of a
coconut, protect the dharma of the Kula Scriptures like the Veda and the Sastras are like
common women open to the public gaze; but
not so the Sambhavi Vidya - the Science of the
Kaula - which is like the bride of a high family.
And the main-spring of this Kula Dharma lies
not in elaborate rituals like abhiseka, not in
Mantra, not in ponderous study of learned
treatises, but in a truthful ordering of life.
Proclaim the glory of the Guru but guard the
holy Mantra imparted to you. The Guru is the
saviour. And more. Just as the sins of the

76

KULARNAVA TANTRA

m i n i s t e r s a r e l a i d at t h e d o o r of t h e k i n g , of the
wife at t h e h u s b a n d ' s , so do t h e sins of the
disciple a c c r u e to t h e G u r u . T h e r e f o r e be on
g u a r d a n d c a r r y out h i s b e h e s t s f a i t h f u l l y , lest
y o u r s i n s of o m i s s i o n a n d c o m m i s s i o n recoil
upon the Guru.

CHAPTER VIII

DEVOTION TO GURU *
Therefore worship him, worship his feet,
cherish the sandals which house his feet, the
paduka. Just as the essence of Speech is there
below in the basic centre, muladhara, just as the
lowest in the rung - the sudras and the like - are
the effective instrumentations, similarly in the
Ocean of Kula all knowledge is founded on the
paduka.
Remember and cherish this paduka
which yields infinitely more merit than any
number of observances, gifts, sacrifices, pilgrimages, mantra-japa and rituals of worship. It is
that which, remembered, protects in times
of distress and danger and calamity. Study,
remembrance, knowledge, donations and sacrifices and worship are truly done by him who
ever remembers on the tip of his tongue the
Mantra of this paduka. Look towards the direction in which the lotus feet of the Guru lie and
bow to it every day with devotion. There is no
mantra higher than that of the paduka, no god
higher than the Guru, no initiation than that of
the Sakta and no merit higher than the Kula
worship. At the root of dhyana is the form of
the G u r u ; at the root of puja is the feet of the
Guru; at the root of the mantra is the word of
the Guru and at the root of all liberation is the
grace of the Guru. In this world all holy actions
are rooted in the G u r u ; therefore is the Guru to
* Ullasa 12

78

KULARNAVA TANTRA

be constantly served with devotion for fulfil,
ment. All fear of distress, grief, avarice
delusion, bewilderment, exists only as long as
one does not take refuge in the Guru All
wanderings in samsara fraught with grief and
impurity last as long as one has no devotion to a
holy Guru. The beautiful mantra of the paduka
whose root is in the grace of the Guru, loaded
with the fruit of all fulfilment purifies and leads
to the supreme Truth. As the boon-giving Guru
gives the mantra in contentment and beatitude,
try to please him with devotion, wealth, your
very life. Indeed, it is only when the high Guru
gives himself to the disciple that he becomes
liberated, free from birth. T h e disciple should
wait upon him till he gets pleased, for once he is
pleased, all the sins drop a w a y . These lovers
of the devoted get for their dependents what
they m a y not even hope for. When the Guru is
pleased, even Gods like Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha, sages and yogins, bestow their grace.
Directed by the compassionate Guru who is
pleased with devotion, the disciple attains
liberation from karma and becomes eligible to
both freedom and fulfilment.
Hence shall the disciple do what is pleasing
to the Guru, by his mind, speech, body and
action. When the Guru so pleased says, 'You
are freed,' indeed, one attains to liberation.
From his transcendent station, the Lord in the
form of the Guru frees one from the bonds of the
pasu. Devotion to the Guru is the one main
t r u t h ; without that all learning, all austerity,
family status, observances are useless; they are
only decorations pleasing to the worldly eye.
Whatever one's station is in life, if he be devoted,

DEVOTION TO GURU

79

he is dear to the Lord and as adorable as the
Lord Himself.
The fire of devotion to the Guru burns awayall taint of bad thought. With devotion even a
cooker of kine is laudable and a learned man
without it is an atheist. He who has complete
devotion, steady and constant in the Guru, what
has he to w o r r y about dharma, artha etc.?
Moksha is in the hollow of his palm. For him
who devotedly remembers, " M y Guru is Shiva
Himself who grants liberation and e n j o y m e n t " ,
fulfilment is not far off
All objects fructify in
him who has supreme devotion to the Lord and
as to the Lord so to the Guru. As to Narayana,
to Mahadeva, to one's own mother and father, so
is devotion to be had to one's own Guru. Look
upon the Guru and his wife as your parents, as
the very Narayana and Lakshmi, as Brahma and
Saraswati, as Shiva and Girija. Not by sacrifice,
gifts, askesis, pilgrimage are all siddhis obtained
in the manner they are by devotion to the Guru.
As the steady devotion for the Guru grows, so
grows one's knowledge.
Why the pains of long pilgrimages? Why
the observances that emaciate the body? All the
fruit anticipated from such austerities can be
easily obtained by motiveless service to the
Guru. The Sruti declares that for those who
seek for fulfilment and liberation, who aspire to
attain to Brahma, Vishnu and Isha, devotion to
the Guru is the Path and no other. Like fire
consuming a whole heap of cotton, this devotion
burns away in a moment all inauspicious karma
and great sins. Glory to that faith in the Guru,
giver of all fulfilments, by which even mud,
wood and stone yield fruit without fail. Neither

80

KULARNAVA TANTRA

yoga nor tapas nor ritual of worship a t t a i n ;
here in this Path of Kula, free from Maya, only
bhakti excels. When the entire universe is
looked upon as pervaded by the Guru, what
Mantra can fail to fructify in that field of the
devoted ? To perdition he goes who regards the
Guru as human, the Mantra as mere letters and
the Images as stone. Never look upon the Guru
as a mortal. Should you do so then neither
Mantra nor worship can give you success. Do
not associate the holy Guru with the ordinary
folk either in your remembrance or in talk.
Otherwise all the good that is done turns into
evil. The parents are indeed to be adored with
all effort because they are the cause of your
birth. But the one to be worshipped especially
is the Guru who shows what is Dharma and
what is not.* Indeed, the Guru is the father,
Guru is the Mother, Guru is God Maheshwara
Himself. Even when God Shiva is wroth, the
Guru is the saviour; but when the Guru himself
is angered, there is none to save. By mind, by
speech, by the body, by action, do what is helpful to the G u r u ; to do what is contrary to his
well being is to invite a precipitous fall. Death
follows the forsaking of the Mantra; wretched
poverty follows the forsaking of the G u r u ;
forsaking of both the Guru and the Mantra leads
to the very hell. Bear the body for the sake of the
G u r u ; acquire wealth for the sake of the G u r u ;
exert yourself for the Guru regardless of your
own life. If the Guru speaks harshly take it as
* The parents give only a human birth in this world,
but the Guru ensures a birth in godhead in this world
and the next.

DEVOTION TO GURU

81

a benediction; even a beating from him take as
a gift. Whatever objects of enjoyment there be,
offer them first to the Guru and take to them as
his leavings.
When the Guru is present no tapas is
necessary; neither is fasting nor observances;
neither pilgrimage nor purificatory bath. To
the Guru, you shall not command nor talk in the
singular; with the Guru you shall not transact
any business of purchase and sale or borrow and
lend.
Do not enter into argument with the deniers
of God nor even talk to t h e m ; avoid them from
afar; do not sit in their company at any time.
When the Guru is present, do not proceed to
worship another; that worship will prove
fruitless When you hold the lotus of his feet on
your head, you have no burden to carry. You
have only to act as per his c o m m a n d ; for the
Guru is indeed the command.
What you hear elsewhere regarding Mantras
and Agamas report to him and accept only what
is approved by h i m and reject what is not.
What he speaks from his own knowledge, do not
speak of that secret to others; to talk of it is to
break the understanding. Feel one with the
Guru and not as another; and do good to all as
your own.
Service to the Guru is fourfold: service by
self, service by means, service by honouring,
service by happy feeling
Please the Guru with
your mind dedicated to his service. The fruit
obtained is the same as from great sacrifices like
the Ashwamedha Such service invites the Grace
of the Divine Mother. If service is accompanied
with a happy devotion it brings in its train all

that is the scripture. Intensely devoted to the
Guru, do not commission others for his work if
you yourself can do it even though you may
have any n u m b e r of attendants.
Whether moving, or standing, sleeping or
waking, doing japa or offering oblation, or
worshipping, carry out only the injunction of
the Guru with your inner being dwelling in him.
Do not be proud because of class, learning or
w e a l t h ; be a l w a y s in service of the Guru, ever
in his presence Giving up desire, anger, humble
and devoted, lauding in spirit, stand on the floor
and do his work. Whether engaged in your own
work or in the work for others, knowing the
mind of the Guru, be by his side humble and
cheerful of countenance. Should you do anything in the presence of the Guru what is
normally prohibited, it is extremely blameworthy. Do not, out of disregard, hear with the
face turned a w a y what the Guru says, whether
it is beneficial or otherwise. To speak falsehood
before the Guru is to commit the highest sin. In
the absence of the Guru who is a w a y and in
distress, do not leave h i m ; go wherever he
commands. When he stands below do not yourself stand above, do not walk in his front, do not
sit when he stands up. Cross not the shadow of
the Shakti, the shadow of God and the shadow of
the G u r u ; do not let your own shadow fall on
them. Do not sleep in his presence. Unless
directed by h i m do not speak, do not read, do
not sing, do not eat there; do nothing without
bowing to h i m
Never fail to c a r r y out his
injunction. Without his command do not believe
on other's word Do everything by the command
of the G u r u : do not comment on his spouse.

DEVOTION TO GURU

85

Bow down with devotion, hold the palms together and stand up.
Thereafter, bowing down
move out of his residence on foot. Never sit on
the same seat as the Guru with his colleagues. Do
not be seated in the presence of the Deity and the
Guru. The highest seat shall be given to the Guru
and good seats to the elders; to the younger
give the alloted seats and to others the same as
yours. Whether you are endowed with class,
learning, or wealth, seeing the Guru from afar,
prostrate yourself with joy and circumambulate
around him thrice. Observe due priorities of
the Guru and the Guru's Guru etc in offering
your obeisances. Give due honour to the elders.
In the presence of the great Guru, bow to
your own Guru mentally.
Bow to everything, from the Divine to a
blade of grass, as to the Guru, but do not bow as
to God to the idol made of iron or earth. Three
prostrations to the Guru, one to the elders,
joining of palms to the honoured, to the rest
verbal greetings. Bow to the Gods, the Guru,
the Teachers of the Kula, the old in know ledge,
the rich in tapas, the highly learned, those who
are steadfast in their Dharma. Do not bow to
the hated of women, cursed by the Guru, the
learned heretic, the dunce, the doer of wrong,
the ingrate, the transgressor of the ordained
steps (ashramas) in life. While staying in the
same place, should you eat food without offering
to the Guru, that becomes impure. Staying in
the same place, prostrate before the Guru thrice,
during the three sandhyas. If you are away,
prostrate as prescribed.*
* the occasions and periods varying with the distance.

86

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Do not approach royalty, the Deity and the
Guru empty-handed. Offer in the measure of
your capacity, fruit, flower, cloth and the like.
Regard the Shakti of the Guru, the Guru's
son, his elder brother as the Guru himself. The
knower of the self shall look after the younger
brother of the Guru as his own son. Bow to the
Teacher of the Kula, to the eldest and the
youngest of the Guru, to one who is almost like a
Guru, as to your own Guru. Elder in the sacrifices, elder in order, elder in Kula, the eldest of
the Guru's sons, these are the four elders.
Respect them in that order, in the prescribed
manner.
To the elders like your father, mother and
other worthy relations, express your sentiment
by getting up, prostration and so on But should
you pose to be a teacher yourself, then these
acts become i l l of you.
Attained to the status of the Lord, pati, do
not bow down to any in the grade of the animal,
pasu He who attains to the status of the Guru
by meditation on the Mantra of the Padukat he
is to be esteemed as the Guru.

The Guru, it is declared in unmistakable
terms, is the very Lord Himself. To approach
the Guru, to worship the Guru, is to approach
the Lord, worship the Lord. Why should the
Lord choose to manifest through the Guru, w h y
should He not act directly?
Shiva is really all-pervading, subtle, above
the mind, without features, imperishable, of the
form of ether, eternal, infinite; how can such a
one be worshipped? That is why, out of compassion for his creatures, He takes the form of the
Guru and when so worshipped in devotion, grants
liberation and fulfilment. Shiva has no binding
form, Shiva is not perceivable by the h u m a n eye;
therefore He protects the disciple conforming to
Dharma in the form of the Guru. T h e Guru is
none other than the supreme Shiva enclosed in
human s k i n ; he walks the earth, concealed, for
bestowing grace on the good disciples. Though
formless, Shiva, the store of compassion, takes
form for the protection of the good devotees and

92

KULARNAVA TANTRA

acts in the world as though he were a householder. He conceals his eye on the forehead,
his crescent of moon and two of his hands and
functions in the form of the Guru on the earth.
The Guru is none other than Shiva without His
three eyes, Vishnu without His four arms,
Brahma without His four faces. To h i m who is
loaded with sinful karma, the Guru appears to
be h u m a n ; but to him whose karma is
auspicious, meritful, the Guru appears as Shiva.
The less fortunate do not recognise the Guru,
embodiment of the supreme T r u t h , even when
face to face with him, like the blind before the
arisen sun. Verily, the Guru is none else but
Sadashiva; that is the truth, there is no doubt
about it. Shiva himself is the G u r u ; otherwise
who is it that gives fulfilment and liberation?
There is no difference between God Sadashiva
and the G u r u ; it is sinful to make a distinction.
He is the Guru because taking the form of the
Preceptor, he cuts asunder all the bonds of the
pasu and leads to the supreme status. Store of
compassion, Ishwara, being the fount of all
Grace, takes the form of the Guru and releases
the ' a n i m a l ' by his initiation. Just as vessel,
pitcher, jar (ghata, kalasa, kumbha) all designate
the same thing, similarly Devata, Mantra, Guru
- all designate the same subject. Devata in truth
is the same as Mantra; Mantra in t r u t h is the
same as the Guru. The fruit of the worship of
the Devata, Mantra, Guru is the same. "Taking
the form of Shiva I aceept the worship; assuming
the form of the Guru I sunder the bonds of
birth."
He who makes you know 'I am the knower
of the essence of all philosophy, I am the core ',

Pity, doubt, fear, shame, disgust, family

bound by these bonds one is a pasu. Freed from
the bonds one is S h i v a ; he is the supreme Guru
who removes these bonds.
He is the Guru who knows the seal of yonimudrd, the revelation of conscious-power of the
Mantra, the real form of the Yantra and the
Mantra; who knows the four conditions of the
m i n d : dispersed, moving to and fro, distressed,
passive and gentle; w h o knows the fruit of the
movement of the jiva in the petals of the seven
Lotuses from the Muladhara to the Brahmar a n d h r a ; who has received the knowledge of the
multitude of Tattvas up to Shiva and Guru in
their successive order.
When he shows the Truth, the disciple
instantly becomes T h a t and considers himself
liberated - such is the Guru and no other.
They are to be served as Gurus who give a
spontaneous joy and remove the pleasures of the
senses; the others are imposters to be abandoned.
The Guru is he who w i t h consideration regulates
the disciple afraid of the fear of samsara by
means of observances, fasts, rules etc.
Difficult to obtain is the Guru who pleased,
gifts to you in the fraction of a second, the
wealth of liberation, taking you across the ocean
of Samsara.
Difficult to obtain is the godly Guru who
gives to the disciple his own capacity in a
moment without any ceremony or effort; who

Pranayama,

96

gives instruction in knowledge which instantly
promotes faith, is easy and gives happiness of
the Self.
He is the Guru who goes on giving knowledge with facility, without strenuous practice
and the like, as one moves from island to island.
Difficult to obtain is the Guru whose mere
instruction gives rise to knowledge, even as food
gives instant contentment to the hungry.
Many are the Gurus like lamps in house and

like the sun.
Many are the Gurus who are proficient to the

Many are the Gurus on earth who give what
is other than the Self; but rare is the Guru in
the worlds who brings to light the Atman.
Many are the Gurus w h o know petty
mantras, medicaments; but r a r e is the Guru
who knows the Mantras handed down by the
Nigama, Agama and Sastra.
Many are the Gurus who rob the disciple of
his wealth; but rare is the Guru who removes
the afflictions of the disciple.
Many are they who are given to the discipline and conduct according to varna (class),
asrama (stage) and kula (family); but he who is
devoid of all volition is the Guru r a r e to find.
He is the Guru by whose very contact there
flows the supreme Ananda; the intelligent
man shall choose such a one as the Guru and
no other.
By the mere sight of him whose intelligence
is active only till the advent of experience, one
attains liberation, there is no doubt of it.

Rare is the Guru who has eaten up Doubt
which has engulfed the three worlds with all
that is moving and unmoving.
As in the vicinity of fire the butter gets
melted, so in the proximity of the holy Guru all
sin dissolves
As lighted fire burns up all fuel - d r y and
moist - so the glance of the Guru burns up in a
moment the sin of the disciple.
As a heap of cotton blown up by a great
storm scatters in all the ten directions, so the
heap of sins is driven away by the compassion
of the Guru.
As darkness is destroyed at the very sight of
the lamps, so is ignorance destroyed at the very
sight of the holy Guru.
He indeed is the Guru who is endowed with
all features, knows the way of the Vedas and
Sastras, knows the procedure of all means,
knows the T r u t h . For him who is without the
Truth, all knowledge of worship, Homa,
Ashrama, conduct, askesis, pilgrimages, observances, Mantra and Agama is fruitless. The
steady one comes to know his own self in the
supreme T r u t h that is to be realised in oneself.
If one has no achievement oneself, how can he
help others to achive?
He who knows not the reality of Brahman in
the form of Mind in himself, how can he give
liberation to another?
He who knows the Truth, is the Guru even
though he be void of all features. T h e knower
of T r u t h alone is the liberated and also the
liberator.
The knower of T r u t h makes even the pasu
understand (the Truth). But from one who is
4949 - 7

98

KULARNAVA TANTRA

devoid of knowledge how is it possible to receive
the truth of the Self? Those who are instructed
by the knowers of T r u t h become undoubtedly
knowers of T r u t h themselves. Those who are
instructed by pasus are verily pasus. It is only
one who is ' s t r u c k ' (initiated by subtle impact)
that can ' s t r i k e ' o t h e r s ; one who is n o t ' s t r u c k '
can hardly be the ' s t r i k e r . ' Only the liberated
one can liberate; how indeed can the unliberated
be the liberator?
Only the proficient in knowledge can uplift
the foolish; how indeed can the foolish uplift
the foolish?
Only the boat can ferry the stone across:
surely a stone cannot ferry a stone!
Engrossed in the affairs of the world, one
obtains no fruit whatever either here or there,
getting a Guru w h o knows not the T r u t h .
Three are the Gurus among the Shaivas; five
among the Vaishnavas; hundreds in the Vedas
and Sastras. But in the K.ula there is only one
Guru.
The Gurus are of six kinds *:
* Different traditions have different classifications of
the Gurus. There is for instance one tradition which
speaks of twelve kinds of Gurus:
1. Dhatuvadi Guru who ensures liberation by making
the disciple practice sadhana, observances and so on.
2. Candana Guru who emanates his high consciousness like the sandal tree giving out its fragrance and
imparting it to other trees in its environs. His mere
proximity acts for liberation.
3. Vicara Guru who acts on the intelligence of the
disciple and leads him through subtler and subtler operations of the buddhi.
4. Anugraha Guru who uplifts by sheer grace.

GURU-SHISHYA

99

Preraka, impeller, who impels interest that
leads to initiation; Sucaka, indicator, who
indicates the sadhana in which interest has been
awakened; Vacaka, explainer, who explains the
process and its object; Darsaka, shower, who
shows definitely the working and its aim in
greater detail; Siksaka, teacher, who actually
teaches how to do sadhana; Bodhaka, Illuminator, who lights up in the disciple the l a m p of
knowledge, mental and spiritual. Of these, the
first five are, as it were, the effects of the last as
the Cause. For it is only the understanding
knowledge imparted by the Bodhaka that brings
5. Parasa Guru whoso mere touch, like that of parasa
(philosopher's stone) transmutes the disciple.
6. Kacchapa Guru who redeems the disciple merely
by thinking of him, like the Kacchapa, tortoise, nourishing its young ones by thought alone.
7. Candra Guru whose natural rays melt the being
of the disciple in the manner of the chandrakanta stone
(moon-stone) oozing out at the rays of the moon.
8. Darpana Guru who like a mirror reveals the true
form (of yourself and the universe) when you meet him.
9. Chayanidhi Guru, whose mere shadow confers
divinity on you even as the shadow of the bird Chayanidhi
is said to confer kinghood on whomsoever falls its
shadow.
10. Nadanidhi Guru who like the precious stone of
that name, which transmutes any metal into gold the
moment its sound reaches it, gives Knowledge the moment
the call of the aspirant reaches him.
11. Krauncapaksi
Guru whose mere remembrance
confers spiritual elevation on the disciple like the
remembrance by the Krauncapaksi feeding its young ones
in a far away place.
12. Suryakanta Guru, whose mere glance burns up the
sins of the disciple like the rays of the sun burning cotton
and the like when they fall on it through the sun-crystal.

100

KULARNAVA TANTRA

to fruition all that is contributed by the rest.
Instigation, inauguration, explanation, direction
and teaching would remain barren unless they
are taken up and assimilated in the Knowledge
that is lit.
There may be m a n y Gurus. But only his
feet-sandals are to be worshipped who is competent to perform the Purna-abhiseka (ceremony
of full bathing).
Having once obtained a Guru who is endowed
with features, who cuts asunder all doubt and
gives knowledge excellently, do not resort to
another. But should you have a Guru w h o does
not have the knowledge and always creates
doubt, no blemish attaches to you if you go to
another. Like the bee greedy for honey going
from flower to flower, the disciple eager for
knowledge goes from Guru to Guru.
We may observe here that this freedom to
go from Guru to Guru has its own advantages
and disadvantages. Each Guru has his own w a y
of approach and communication. T h e seeker is
the gainer for meeting many who are advanced
on the Path. His horizon widens, mind becomes
more catholic But he is disciple to nobody and
the responsibility to pool together a l l that he
receives and organise it purposively for his selfadvancement lies squarely on his own shoulders.
On the other hand if one is fortunate to find the
right Guru he takes himself to him in fullness
and if the Guru accepts h i m as his disciple, then
according to all spiritual tradition the Guru
takes charge of his spiritual life. The responsibility rests with the Guru as long as that
relation is allowed to continue.

CHAPTER X

DIKSHA (INITIATION)*
It is laid down by the Lord that there can be
no moksa, liberation, without diksa, initiation;
and initiation cannot be there without a Teacher,
hence it comes down the line of Teachers,
parampara.
Without a Teacher, all philosophy,
traditional knowledge, Mantras are fruitless.
Him alone the gods laud who is the Guru
keeping active what is handed down by tradition, who is well versed in the Mantras and
Agamas and guards the way of the Samaya
(Traditional) Doctrine. Though himself unattached, the Guru, after testing him for some
time, on command of the Lord, shall deliver
(the truth) to his disciple, in order to vest him
with authority. Of h i m who is so invested
with authority, there is verily union with the
Supreme Shiva; at the termination of the bodily
life his is the eternal liberation - this is declared
by the Lord. Therefore should one seek with
all effort to have a Guru of the unbroken Tradition born of the supreme Shiva himself.
After testing the disciple in the prescribed
manner for the fruition of the Shakti and for
happy success, the Guru shall communicate to
h i m the Mantra; otherwise it will be fruitless.
If one gives contrary to this requirement, if
one receives contrary to it, both he who gives
and he who receives shall stand cursed for generations. If, out of delusion, the Guru and the
* Ullasa 14

102

KULARNAVA TANTRA

disciple give and receive the instruction without
prior mutual testing, they suffer condemnation.
So too if the instruction is contrary to the Scripture, both he who gives and he w h o receives
suffer perdition. He who imparts instruction
that is not sanctified is a sinner; his Mantra is
lost like paddy-seed in the sands Knowledge of
the Mantra never holds in the undeserving; that
is w h y one is to proceed after due testing, otherwise it is fruitless
Initiating according to the
tradition, giving its paduka (Mantra), seating the
disciple close to oneself, the Guru shall utter the
Mantra; not otherwise.
The knowledge that is
imparted to the good disciple, excellently
devoted, shall be according to the scripture and
shall be communicated whole i e. without segmenting it. Whatever know ledge is imparted
to the bad and undevoted disciple, it becomes
i m p u r e like the cow's milk mixed w i t h dog's
ghee.
To initiate one who is unfit by reason of
cupidity, fear, greed etc. invites the curse of
the Deity and what is done will be fruitless. In
knowledge and in action, shall the Guru test the
disciple with effort for the period of one year or
half or quarter Bring the high to the low, the
low to the high, in matters concerning life,
money, prostration, commands just and otherwise. He who does not grieve on account of
such delusive cruel doings, words corresponding
to these doings, frequent partialities, indifferences, several and repeated, whether pulled or
beaten, always takes it as the Grace of the Guru.
T h e y who thrill with joy, tremor, horripilation
and change in voice, eyes etc. at the remembrance of the Guru, in his laudation, in his

DIKSHA (INITIATION)

103

audience, in prostration to him, in his service,
in calling him and sending him off - they are fit
to be inducted in the purification for initiation.
T h e disciple also shall test the Guru in
similar signs of joy etc. in japa, stotra, dhyana,
homa, puja and so on. After knowing his capacity for transmission of knowledge perfection
in the science of Mantra, ability to make subtle
impact, one is to become his disciple, not otherwise.
There are those who are competent in the
beginning, those competent in the middle and
those competent in the end, due to the transmission of the Guru's Shakti; these disciples are
called the lowest, the middling and the best
respectively.
Those in w h o m there is devotion at the outset, when they come for initiation but whose
enthusiasm cools down soon, are the adiyogya,
competent in the beginning.
Those who arrive when the time for initiation is at hand and have neither special nor a n y
knowledge, but whose past is done a w a y with
by their devotion, are the madhyayogya, competent in the middle.
Those who have no devotion at the outset,
who have devotion in the middle and whose
devotion is fully grown at the end are the
antayogya, competent at the end and known as the
best jnanins.
Instruction, upadesa, is of three k i n d s : that
of karma, of dharma, of jnana. Of these the
instruction or path of karma proceeds slowly
like the ant which takes long to reach the fruit
at the top of the tree, proceeding slowly and
slowly. The path of dharma is like the pace of

104

KULARNAVA TANTRA

the monkey which strains, jumping from branch
to branch, and reaches the fruit. The path of
jnana is like that of the bird which flies straight
and rests on the fruit quickly.
Initiation, diksa, is of three k i n d s : initiation
by touch, spared, initiation by sight, drksanjna,
initiation by thought, manasa - all these three
are done without ritual, without exertion.
Initiation and instruction by touch is likened
to the slow nourishing of its young by the bird
with the w a r m t h of its wings.
Initiation and instruction by sight is like the
nourishing of its young by the fish through its
seeing alone.
Initiation and instruction by thought (subtle
impingement) is like the nourishing of its young
by the tortoise by only thinking of t h e m .
The disciple receives the Grace according
to the impact of the Shakti, saktipata; where
there is no impact of sakti, there is no fulfilment.
Altogether, diksa, initiation, that gives
liberation is said to be of seven k i n d s : diksa
through r i t u a l ; through letter; through special
emanation (kala); through touch; through
speech; through s i g h t ; through thought.
Diksa is also classified as f o l l o w s : samaya,
when it authorises the disciple to help the Guru
manually in puja etc.; putrika when it enjoins
on him to perform the ritual indicated; sadhika,
when it initiates h i m in the inner sadhana;
vedhaka, when it impinges subtly; purna-acharya
when it vests on one the full competence of a
teacher; nirvana, when it leads to laya through
sadhana.
Eightfold again is diksa through outer ritual

DIKSHA (INITIATION)

105

in which kunda fire-bowl, mandapa, enclosure,
kalasa jar etc., are used; prescribed means are
to be adopted for the purification of the body.
Diksa of letter, varna is threefold depending
on whether the letters are 42 or 50 or 62 Letters
shall be placed on the body of the disciple and
withdrawn in reverse order, joining his consciousness to the supreme Self. After withdrawal, the letters are to be again laid on the
person of the disciple in the order of creation
and as prescribed; so too shall be exercised the
Consciousness. The state of godhood full of
delight is born in the child (of the Guru). This is
the varnamayi diksa which removes all bonds.
Kala diksa is also threefold* to be done as
prescribed. Beginning from the base of the feet
up to the knee, it is nivrtti kala; from the knee
to the navel it is pratistha; from navel to the
neck it is vidya; from the neck to the forehead
it is santi; from there to the head it is
santyatita.
This is the graded spread of kaladiksa.
Following the order of withdrawal, the
knower of the sequence, joins from place to
place up to the head. This is the kala diksa of
38 parts or 50. Knowing from the Guru, following the order of creation and withdrawal in the
placement of the tattvas, one shall center and
impinge on the disciple. Then is born the state
of godhead and the meeting with the yogins and
viras (higher beings). This is the kala diksa
which destroys the bonds of the pashu.
* anavi, sakti, sambhavi, that is to day effectuating
through mantra, though transmission of sakti, through
direct impact of the Guru.

106

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Invoking Lord Siva in the hand, doing japa
as prescribed, the Guru shall touch the person
of the disciple; this is sparSa diksa, tactual
initiation.
Securing the mind in the T r u t h , shall the
Guru utter the body of Mantras which are
expansions of the supreme T r u t h ; that is the
vag-diksa, verbal initiation.
Closing the eyes and meditating upon the
supreme Truth, with a happy mind shall the
Guru gaze well into the disciple; that is drgdiksa, ocular initiation.
When by the mere look or speech or touch
of the Guru, there is an instantaneous Knowledge, that is sambhavi diksa.
Of two kinds is mano-diksa, mental initiation - intense and highly intense, tivra and
tivratara.
Knowing the sixfold Route, adhva,
one shall form in the body of the disciple, the
bhuvana, tattva, kala} varna, pada and mantra from the knee, navel, heart, neck, palate to top
of the head.
The wise shall effect the vedha (subtle
impact) following the method received from
the Guru. In a moment will the disciple in
bonds get freed from them. This is intense,
tivra, initiation yielding liberation.
Merely by remembrance on the part of the
Guru, proficient in the vedha, the disciple has
his sin severed; this is the highly intense,
tivratara diksa. Released from external activity
he falls on the ground instantly; a godly state
arises in him and he comes to know everything.
Whatever is there at that moment of impact, he
experiences it himself, but on waking up he is
unable to speak of that happiness. Struck by

DIKSHA (INITIATION)

107

such impact, one verily is a Shiva, he has no
more birth This is the tivratara diksa that
releases from the bonds of birth, yields the
very state of Shiva.
Of one so struck six are the states described:
joy, tremor, new birth, reeling, sleep, swoon.
These six characteristics are seen at the time of
the impact. Wherever be the person so struck,
he is liberated; there is no doubt of it.
Difficult to get is such a Guru who can
initiate thus by subtle impact; difficult also is
the disciple fit for i t ; it is only by happy
conjunction of merit that he is obtained But
this initiation shall not be given to anybody and
everybody; such is the Command.
Duly worshipping the circle of the Kula with
appropriate ingredients of Kula worship, the
Guru shall show it to the disciple. This is the
kauliki diksa, initiation of the Kaula.
Filling the mouth with the substance for
worship mixed with the five nectarous products
of the cow*, the Guru shall bathe the disciple
with i t ; this is called the gandusa dkisa, mouthful initiation.
Diksa is again twofold depending on whether
it is external, bahya, or internal, antara; the
external is kriya diksa (ritualistic initiation) and
the other, internal, is the vedha diksa (subtle
impact).
Purification is twofold, inner and o u t e r ; the
inner is effected by appropriate ritual, the outer
by diksa. By diksa, the light of liberation, even
the lowest born is freed. Without these two the
Kaulika is not liberated.
* ksiram dadhi tatha oa a j y a m mutram gomayameva ca
Pancagavyam.

108

KULARNAVA TANTRA

The body as such cannot be purified; nor the
karma. It is the inner being that is to be
processed through the diksa of the ageless Shakti
that is Kundali.
Though the ritual be the same, these dlksas
work out different results on the meeting of the
Guru and the worthy disciple.
As the power of poison is killed by Mantra
or by medicine, so does the knower of Mantra
sever in a trice the bonds of the pasu by dlksa
From this extensive bondage diksa alone
liberates, by pointing out the supreme station
and leads to the ancient divine Abode.
Diksa, given according to the prescribed
mode, burns up in a moment all ill-omens and
great sins in their millions.
That by which the pasus (animal men) have
their eyes opened and become Shivas, is the diksa
which liberates from the bonds of the paSus.
That which instantly generates faith and
conviction is diksa; the rest are only pleasing to
the populace.
That diksa without which there is no fulfil
ment even with a hundred upasanas, should be
obtained from a holy Guru for the success of the
Mantra.
As iron struck by mercury becomes gold so
does the soul struck by diksa attain to Shivahood
With all karma burnt out by diksat all bonds
of Maya severed, attaining to the supreme end of
Jnana, seedless*, he becomes Shiva.
Gone is the shudrahood of a shudra the
brahmanhood of a brahmana; there obtains no
distinction of caste where there is the effect of

CHAPTER XI

PURASCHARANA*
Among the various lines of self-elevation
prescribed to the seekers of the Truth, the
Kularnava lauds the Japa as the pre-eminent and
invests it with the sanctity and efficacy of a
yajna, sacrifice, for attaining the fourfold object
of life viz. dharma, Right, artha, Wealth, Kama,
Desire and moksa, liberation. All other means
can be left out and only the means of mantra i.e.
japa of mantra resorted to which is sure to yield
success if carried out without blemish But if it
is allowed to be tarnished with fault then its
fruit is indeed inauspicious. Japa is the happy
giver of enjoyment, salvation, self-fulfilling
wish. Therefore practise the Yoga of Japa and
Dhyana. All blemishes due to transgressions of
rule, from the Jiva up to the Brahma, done knowingly or unknowingly, are wiped away by Japa.
Should you desire fulfilment in this life
ridden heavily with unhappiness, doing Japa of
the Mantra with the five-limbed upasana you
w i l l attain happiness. Daily puja at the three
prescribed hours - in the morning, noon and
evening - japa, tarpana (offering of libation),
homa and feeding the Brahmanas is this fivefold
upasana called purascarana.
If any of these
limbs are lacking, make up for it with appropriate increase of Japa as prescribed. For no
fulfilment is possible if there be want of l i m b ;
hence attempt to set it right by Japa w i t h
devotion.

the sadhana of Mantra Japa. Choose a n y of
these or live where your mind is contented.
Japa is praised when done in the proximity
of the sun or the fire, Guru moon, lamp, water,
cow, a brahmana family or a tree. For purposes
of the Japa, the enclosed space of a house is
good; better is the dwelling of a c o w ; still
better is a temple and the best is in the immediate presence of Shiva.
Free from foreign elements, the wicked, the
wild beasts, free from suspicion and obstruction, dwell in a lonely, holy, cavil free, devout,
your own, righteous, opulent, charming, undisturbed place of tapas where dwell the
devotees. The knower of Mantra shall not stay
where move kings, ministers, officers nobles.
Nor shall he live in sites of ruined temples,
gardens, houses, trees, rivers, tanks, walls and
landslides.
If one does japa or puja without first offering
to the Guru who holds the Light, then he takes
the fruit and all effort shall be in vain
The wise shall reject the seat made of
bamboo, stone, earth, wood, grass s p r o u t ; it
only brings poverty, disease and misery. He
shall have a seat made of cotton wool, cloth,
skin of lion, tiger or deer; it brings good fortune,
knowledge and increase. And seating himself
in an asana - padma, swastika of vira etc. - he
shall perform japa and puja. Otherwise they
w i l l be fruitless.
Pranayama
shall be joined to japa and
dhyana in the prescribed manner - with the
specifically regulated exhalation, recaka, inhalation, puraka, retention, kumbhaka, bringing

the b o d y ' and 'bathing the entire b o d y ' in the
nectar of union of Kundali and Shiva Pranayama
is infinitely potent when combined w i t h japa
and dhyana. Austerities, pilgrimages, sacrifices,
charities, observances are not worth even a
fraction of such Pranayama. All sin, mental,
verbal or physical, is burnt up in only three
Pranayamas
As i m p u r i t y of the mental is
burnt away when it is blown upon, the sins of
the senses are burnt out by the control of prana.
Whatever action is done by one who is purified
by Pranayama, that fructifies, undoubtedly, even
if done effortlessly. He who does this practice
regularly in accordance with the direction in the
Agama, attains the state of godhood and acquires
perfection in Mantra, mantrasiddhi.

who performs japa of the Mantra as prescribed
with nyasa, kavaca and chandas, obstructions
flee like elephants at the sight of the lion. But
if any one foolishly does the Mantra-japa without taking the precaution of nyasa etc. he is
harassed by all obstructions like the infant deer
by the tigers.
While doing the japa one may take the help
of the rosary, rotating it with one's fingers in
the prescribed manner, taking care to conform
to the injunction regarding the use of particular
fingers for particular purposes
Japa is of three kinds Japa done aloud in
the hearing of others is the lowest; japa done in
low tones, lips moving and which others cannot
follow, is the m i d d l e ; japa done mentally without movement of lips is the best If the repetition is too clipped, it causes disease; if too
extended, it causes decay of tapas; and when
letters are pronounced not distinctly but stuck

cunningly lettered, benumbed, reverse-faced, broken,

being cognisant of these defects there is no fulfilment however much he may practise.
There are ten processes for the eradication
of these defects of Mantra: giving birth, giving
life, striking making aware, ceremonial bath,
cleansing of i m p u r i t y , satisfying, libation,
lighting, covering in protection. As weapons
rubbed on the whetstone get sharpened, Mantras
subjected to these processes acquire bloom.
For one who does the mantra-japa the Sastra
lays down what is to be eaten, what is to be
offered, the vegetable, roots, fruit, barley etc.
If any one acquires merit in the w a y of the
Dharma, nourished in body by food and drink
from another, then half the merit belongs to the
donor of the food and half to the doer. Therefore an intelligent person shall, with all effort,
reject another's food during the time of the
performance and of ritual for desired ends.
T h e tongue is burnt by the food of a n o t h e r ;
hands burnt by accepting from a n o t h e r ; the
mind burnt by (thoughts of) women of o t h e r s ;
how then can there be success in the endeavour?
If the mind be in one place, Shiva (passive consciousness) in another, Shakti (active consciousness) in another, and life-breath in still another
place, even a crore of japa is useless. All should
be gathered in one effort If learning is acquired
for the sake of debate, japa is done for the sake of
another, gifts given for the sake of fame, how can
there be fulfilment? If pilgrimage is done for the
sake of wealth, austerities for show, worship of
deity for selfish purpose, how indeed can there
be fulfilment? Fools are they who do nyasa,
puja, japa, homa, w i t h a body that is u n c l e a n ;
they all are fruitless. If the ritual is done by

PURASCHARNA

117

one unclean due to faces, urine and other
leavings, then all japa, worship etc. is rendered
i m p u r e . Him who makes japa with soiled cloth,
soiled hair, bad odour of mouth on his person,
the Deity being disgusted burns up in a moment.
Avoid during japa all laziness, yawning, sleep,
sneeze, spitting, fear, touching of lower limbs,
anger The mantra does not succeed where there
is excessive food, meaningless talk, gossip,
rigidity of rule, attachment to another, fickleness. Do not perform japa with a turban on,
w i t h cloak, naked, hair dishevelled, surrounded
by retinue, unclean upper cloth, or while i m p u r e
or while walking Avoid during Japa inertia,
grief, useless activity, free imagination and
passing of wind. Be calm, be clean, limited in
food, sleeping on ground, devoted, in full
control, free from duality, steady of mind,
silent, self-controlled and do Japa. With
confidence, belief, composure, faith, regularity,
certitude, contentment, enthusiasm, and like
qualities, do Japa.
Success in japa lies in his hands who is
decked with fragrant flowers, ornaments and
clothes. Devoted to the Mantra, with life
dedicated to it, with mind centred upon it,
w h o l l y given to it, following its meaning and
meditating upon it, do Japa of the Mantra.
When tired by japa, take to dhyana; tired in
dhyana take again to japa. Of him who does
both japa and dhyana, the Mantra achieves anon.

The seventeenth and the last Ullasa of the
Kularnava gives interesting derivations of many
of the important t e r m s in the Tantra Sastra
throwing a flood of light on the height of aim
and the exactitude in detail of the wide-visioned
builders of this system. It begins with the Gurumantra, the prayer to the Guru:
" B o w to Thee Oh Lord, to Shiva in the form
of the Guru, who takest on many forms for the
purpose of the manifestation and the fulfilment
of the supreme Knowledge; who art in the form
of Narayana, who art in the form of the supreme
Self, who art the sun dispelling the darkness of
all Ignorance, who art charged with cit, who
knowest all, who a r t the embodiment of compassion, who art the Auspicious. who givest
w h a t is auspicious to all devotees here and
beyond.
I bow to Thee in front, at the sides, at
the back, above and below. As Sat-Chit, ordain
that I m a y ever be T h y servitor.
Guru: gu signifies darkness; ru what restrains it. He who restrains darkness (of ignorance) is the guru.
ga signifies giver of fulfilment; r, severer of
s i n ; u, Vishnu. He who contains all the three in
himself is the supreme guru.
ga signifies wealth of knowledge; r, illumin a t o r ; u, identity with Shiva- He who contains
these in himself is the guru.

w h o are blind to the T r u t h of the Self and of the
