FOREWORD

T

HIS BOOK makes no claim to literary merit. It is
simply a work of research and documentation,
giving evidence and facts which I trust will help the
reader in drawing his own conclusions. In the course of
my researches as an international political investigator
into the causes of social unrest, I have probed the depths
of infamy which now surrounds, not ours only, but also
the next generation, whose right to lead a decent life
should be as good as was ours. As a woman of the world
I have witnessed things the existence of which I did not
suspect and I have realised that, due to my " protected "
position in life, they should never have been expected to
have come to my knowledge. Let me tell every woman,
however much " protected", whether Dairymaid or
Duchess, that the safeguards which she imagines to be
thrown around herself are but a mirage of the past. Her
own and her children's future are at the mercy of those "
forces " the activities of which it has been my business,
for the

last ten years, to follow as one of a group of
investigators.
Today, most of the good people are afraid to be good.
They strive to be broadminded and tolerant ! It is
fashionable to be tolerant — but mostly tolerant of evil
— and this new code has reached the proportions of
demanding intolerance of good. The wall of resistance
to evil has thus been broken down and no longer affords
protection to those who, persecuted by evil doers, stand
in need of it.
Worse still, there are cases wherein virtuous people's
good name is relentlessly " filched from them ", but no
effort will be made by the presumed good people to rally
to their defence. Happy are they if they themselves can
discover the cause of their ruin, materiel or moral, either
partial or total.
In offering this book to the public, I have endeavoured
to expose some of the means and methods used by a
secret world, one might almost say an underworld, to
penetrate, dominate and destroy not only the so-called
upper classes, but also the better portion of all classes.
There are those who feel confident that if they refrain
from joining any society or group and avoid entanglements, no harm can befall them. To such, let me say that
situations can be, and are, created for innocent dupes
every day and wrecked homes are the direct result.
Neither fortune nor a blameless

life led, as it were, in an island of strict virtue in the
midst of a tumultuous sea of evil, spells security.
Irrefutable evidence of a particular example of
underworld tyranny has come into my possession. The
victim's guilt was her reluctance to step from virtue into
the mire of evil which surrounded her. Moreover she
was intolerant of evil and sought to oppose and destroy it.
The case of her persecution at the hands of her foes is
complete. She belonged to what is termed Society as did
also some of the other actors in this bewildering drama.
The world, social, financial, legal and, shall we say also,
the underworld, leaving to this word its generally
accepted literal meaning, knows them. So many Jekylls
and Hydes stalk about unsuspectingly in our midst !
From such an example I have been led to the
conclusion that, among others, three factors can help
one from being completely destroyed by the combined
forces of that" underworld " : a flawless life,
independent means and real friends, all three of which
must be backed by a fearless determination to fight evil
on all points of the Masonic compass.
In these days when apparently vice triumphs and
virtue must be penalized, it may be well for all of us to
fight the undertow by which our children may be
dragged under and must of necessity perish. Vice rings
and secret societies

form but one vortex into which youth is drawn and
destroyed whilst the " good people ", because of their
ignorance, look on helplessly in despair.
It is for their instruction that this book has been
written. Its compilation has taken several years and, had
it not been for the generous efforts of one of my friends,
Mme de Shishmareff, and of several other persons, I
would never have been able to complete the task which I
set out to accomplish.
What must concern us all now is the protection of
decency or, in other words — Equal rights — for such
as are not vice adepts.
This book is not complete. It will never be complete,
but for the present it must remain as a study of the root
conditions which have led to present day subversive
upheavals and the overthrow of the principles of
Christian civilization.

" My final work is a word of warning to American women : Keep
away from the Swamis, the Yogis, the traveling teaching men. You
would need no such bidding if, for an instant, you guessed the truth.
In your good faith, in your eager-minded receptivity of
high-sounding doctrine, in your hunger for colour, romance,
glamour, and dreams come true, you expose yourself, all
unsuspecting, to things that, if you knew them, would kill you dead
with unmerited shame. "
Katherine Mayo in Why I wrote Mother India.

THE MYSTERIES OF FREEMASONRY

CHAPTER
OF

THE

I THE RELIGION

SECRET

Man is a creature of mind and matter. To the realm of mind
belongs metaphysical thought which, whether trained or
untrained, is peculiar to each individual and is subject for its
development or restraint to his will. It is the basis of religion
in the generally accepted sense of this word ; it is purely
spiritual and can reach the height of mysticism. From it issue
creeds or doctrines and the erection of a theological system of
beliefs.
Imparted to other individuals and accepted by them, the
metaphysical thought of a few great minds has become the
basis of religious systems. Upon its teaching was grafted a
Ritual or Law, disciplining the life, mystic, moral, social and
even physical, of its adherents or believers. From the exercise
of such laws, theocracy or the rule of priesthood was evolved.
It is to be found in every religion regardless of the fact that in
some instances like in the Buddhist doctrine of Gautama and
in the teaching of Jesus Christ, nothing is further removed
than ritualism from the metaphysical thought or religious
conception of the founders.
21

22

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

The power of theocrasy or exercise of government rule
over the masses by a hierarchy of priests or adepts rested on
its dual system of teaching, namely : Exote-rism and
Esoterism, the former a code of discipline of the thought and
mode of life of the masses, the latter the hierarchic school
wherein were trained the chosen adepts destined to safeguard
the rules imposed upon the people by the high priests.
Upon a close study of the manifold religious systems, the
corruption of which led to theocratic rule, namely,
Brahminism, the Ancient Egyptian Cult, Mosaism or Judaism,
Christianism and Mahometanism, one finds the accepted
belief of Monotheism as the basis of esoteric or secret belief
or doctrine. Monotheism is here taken in the sense of First
Principle.
Whereas the Egyptian high priesthood of Memphis kept
this theory as the esoteric teaching of the high adepts, Moses,
brought up as one of them, gave it as exoteric or popular belief
to the Israelitic sect to which he belonged, embodying it in a
deity, the terrible Jehovah of the Jews.
Another side of the esoteric teaching was that of occultism,
the development of all human psychic forces which, when
misused, lead to the practice of magic. The esoteric part of all
religions or hermeticism, the teaching and practice of
occultism, led to the development of what might be termed
the religion of the secret, which eventually overshadowed and
helped to dissimulate subversive activities.
It is with this that we are chiefly concerned and will
endeavour, to some degree, to show its baneful influence on
society of all creeds and nations. Let the reader bear in mind
that it is not the object of this work to discuss the place
occupied and the part played by either Metaphysics and
Philosophy on the one

THE RELIGION OF THE SECRET

23

hand, and Science and Ritualism on the other. The limitations
of each and its encroachment upon the territory of the others,
the ensuing conflicts, are matter for the history of fanaticism
throughout the ages. Our aim is to follow the outgrowth of
Esoterism and a few of its multiple ramifications in the realm
of perversion and subversion.

CHAPTER

II

THE MEANING OF OCCULTISM

A summary and some explanation of the principal forms of
occultism must precede the chapters which deal with the
historical side of this subject, and the objections, those of the
credulous as well as those of the sceptics, must be foreseen
and forestalled. Many persons are tempted to deny, arbitrarily
and without examination, statements on matters of which
they have no previous knowledge, but even the possible
criticism of such as these must have received due consideration.
In this age of wireless and aeroplanes, one of the fads of the
modern highbrow is to scoff at such things as sorcerers,
magic and evocations as old wives' tales. Tales of ancient
history ! There are people who refuse to believe in the
existence of the supernatural, perhaps we should say
supernormal, even when confronted with the evidence. Such
are the sceptics who deny everything. Hidebound in their
prejudice, they ignore the fact that magic, White or Black, has
now as many adepts as ever, nor can they distinguish between
the different schools of spiritism.
First, there are the charlatans whose tricks in the line of
Spiritism are generally sooner or later unmasked.
24

THE MEANING OF OCCULTISM

25

Second, there are the Occultists who operate in secrecy and
hide their meetings from all but initiates with the greatest
care.
Many persons are duped by charlatans, so the sceptics
persuade themselves of the absolute non-existence of all
diabolical practices in modern times. They are wrong. For
Occultism flourishes now in Europe, Asia, and America. The
Black Mass is said today in Paris and London, and Satanism
has its faithful followers. On this subject one of the most
eminent writers was Carl Hackse, who, under the pseudonym
of Dr. Bataille, made an extensive study of Occultism and
gave his extremely exaggerated views of it in the book Le
Diablc au XIXe Siecle.
The following pages of this chapter are mostly either
quotations or abridgements from that work :
" According to the teaching of the Christian churches, God
allows demons certain limited powers, but they are not
permitted to open the gates of hell and release a spirit at the
request of one who evokes the dead. The dead, even damned,
will not show themselves if evoked, nor would evocations be
answered by those who had succeeded in attaining the
kingdom of heaven, but devils can and do, says the Church,
substitute themselves for the deceased. They will impersonate
a dead person whose appearance is demanded by invocations.
" It is also admitted that the fallen angels or spirits will
often manifest to people without being called, The theological
hagiographa cite many cases of diabolical apparitions to
saints, apparitions which these saints have been able to repel
and conquer... but what sceptics and agnostic Christians alike
ignore is that besides the drawing room mediums, mediums
for diversion, there are occultists whose vile practices are

26

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

veiled in the profoundest mystery. These men, whose moral
sense is absolutely perverted, believe in Lucifer, but they
believe him to be the equal of God and worship him secretly.
"'
Modern Occultism is on the one hand practical Cabala and
on the other, Indian Yogism, both of which have always had
their adepts more or less openly.
The Cabala is Occult Science itself. It is the secret theology
of the initiates, theology essentially Satanic. In a word the
counter-theology. Our God, the God of the Christians, is the
power of evil in the eyes of the Cabalists ; and for them the
power of good, the real God, is Lucifer.
" The Cabala teaches magic or the art of intercourse with
spirits and supernatural beings.
" One cannot be a convinced Cabalist without soon
becoming a magician and devoting oneself to the practices of
occultism.
" Not that our Cabalists or contemporary magicians practise
all the different branches of occultism. Some of these have
been abandoned and others are only used by charlatans for the
exploitation of superstitious persons, but a great many,
precisely the most criminal and perverse, are observed in the
hidden dens of our modern Luciferians. " 2
Magic has two divisions :
The first is divining magic, subdivided into several
branches of which the principal are :
Astrology
Palmistry
Anthropomancy
Oneirocritics

Aeromancy
Hydromancy
Pyromancy
Cartomancy

1. Bataille, Le Diable au XDC Siecle, vol. I, p. 28.
2. Ibid., p. 29.

THE

MEANING OF OCCULTISM

27

The second is operative magic, also subdivided into
several branches of which the principal are :
Alchemy
Necromancy
Mesmerism
Theurgy
Various miraculous feats
There are moreover some superstitious practices not
specially classed.
Bataille thus defines some of the foregoing :
Astrology. — Divining the future by the stars. The casting
of horoscopes is its most prevalent practice.
Palmistry. — Divining the future by the hand.
Anthropomancy. — This is one of the practices supposed at
present to have fallen into disuse. It is a horrible, savage
abomination and consists in disembowelling a human being
for the purpose of divining the future by inspection of the
entrails.
Mediaeval history accuses Gilles de Retz of perpetrating
this crime on children, whom he lured to his castle for the
purpose. Tacitus says that the Druids, in ancient Britain, used
to consult their Gods by looking into the entrails of their
captives.
Oneirocritics. — Divining the future through interpretation
of dreams.
Aeromancy. — Divination by the study of aerial
phenomena.
Hydromancy. — Divination by the study of liquids or
aquatic phenomena.
Pyromancy. — Divination by fire.
Cartomancy. — Divination by cards.
There is no need to expatiate further on the more or less
grotesque means employed by those who follow these false
sciences. One must be somewhat erratic to imagine that the
future can be foretold by coffee grounds, by the antics of
flames in a grate, by the order

28

OCCULT THEOCRASY

in which shuffled cards will be drawn, or by the odd shapes
assumed by wind-driven clouds ! When events corroborate
predictions made under these conditions, it can be attributed
to the use of the power of clairvoyance, but these fortune
tellers, some of whom have a thorough knowledge of the rules
governing the practices of these absurdities, are the first to
distrust their art.
Such expedients, disdained by the real occultists, are too
unimportant to be worthy of note. It is quite another matter to
expose the Satanists, ignored by the public, whose sects,
bearing different names in different countries, constitute, in
reality, only one, single, secret religion whose fanatics,
imbued with the spirit of evil, will sacrifice themselves
blindly to their cause.
Throughout the universe, all Luciferian and Satanic rites
bear a basic similarity.
Dealing principally with the practices of contemporary
operative magic, it is Bataille's opinion that as regards the
mysterious art of Alchemy, its theory is called Hermetic
Science and has a double objective, namely, the discovery of
the philosopher's stone, a substance capable of transmuting
base metals into gold and drinkable gold, or the Elixir of long
life which is a magic potion endowed with the properties
necessary to prolong human life indefinitely or, at least, to
maintain in old age the faculties of youth. Alchemy as a
science seems now obsolete.
The Alchemists knew the existence of microbes and toxins
long before the medical discoveries of the present age. The
laboratories of Satanic bacteriology have been working, for a
long time, on cultures of bacilli or solutions of their toxic
properties which, even when administered in infinitesimal
doses, mixed with food or drink, disseminate disease and
death where it is

THE MEANING OF OCCULTISM

29

judged necessary by the " Masters " that life is to be destroyed.
In these cases deaths occur from apparently natural causes!
He further says that Magnetic Mesmerism is the occult
medicine of the Cabalists. One must naturally not confuse the
scientists who are at present making researches in hypnotism
and suggestion, in the interest of science, with the emulators
of Cagliostro whose aim is to procure diversions, often
wicked and immoral. Scientific magnetism is still an obscure
question being studied by theologians, physiologists and
criminologists, whereas that of the adepts of magic has
nothing to do with this ; it is a branch of the subterranean
work that is nearing its goal today.
Necromancy is partly divining magic and partly operative
magic. This practice consists in the evocation of the spirits of
the dead. Spiritism and rapping of tables are necromancy, but
if all spiritists are not necessarily Cabalists, all Cabalists are
practicing necromancy. People are far from suspecting the
progress made by necromancy along these lines. Freemasonry
is yearly more and more invaded by the spiritist element to the
extent that, in 1889, an international convention of spiritist
Freemasons attended by about 500 delegates was held at the
Hotel of the Grand Orient of France, rue Cadet, Paris.
This was only a beginning ! 3
Eliphas Levi, a renowned occultist of the 19th century,
writing in Histoire de la Magie, 4 in the following words,
sounds a warning to those who, recklessly, would venture into

always disastrous to those who indulge in them. When one
has once stood on the threshold of the other world one must
die and almost invariably under terrible conditions. First
giddiness, then catalepsy followed by madness. It is true that
the atmosphere is disturbed, the woodwork cracks and doors
tremble and groan in the presence of certain persons, after a
series of intoxicating acts. Weird sounds, sometimes bloody
signs, will appear spontaneously on paper or linen. They are
always the same and are classed by magicians as Diabolical
writings. The very sight of them induces a state of convulsion
or ecstacy in the mediums who believe themselves to be
seeing spirits. Thus Satan, the Spirit of Evil, is transfigured
for them into an angel of light but, before they will manifest,
these so-called spirits require sympathetic excitement
produced by sexual intercourse on the part of their devotees.
Hands must be placed in hands, feet on feet, they must breathe
in each other's faces, these acts often being followed by others
of an obscene character. The initiates, revelling in these forms
of excesses believe themselves to be the elect of God and the
arbiters of destiny. They are the successors of the fakirs of
India. No warning will save them.
" To cure such illnesses, the priests of Greece used to
terrify their patients by concentration and exaggeration of the
evil in one great paroxysm. They made the adept sleep in the
cave of Trophonius. After some preliminary preparations, he
descended to a subterranean cavern in which he was left
without light soon to be prostrated by intoxicating gases. Then
the visionary, still in the throes of ghastly dreams caused by
incipient asphyxia, was rescued, being carried off
prophesying on his tripod. These tests gave their nervous
systems such a shock that the patients

never dared mention evocations of phantoms again.
" Theurgy is the highest degree of occultism. Necromancy
is limited to the summoning of dead souls, but the Theurgists
of the nineteenth century evoke entities qualified by them as
genii, angels of light, exalted spirits, spirits of fire etc. In their
meetings, scattered throughout the world, they worship
Lucifer. The three mysterious letters J... B... M..., that the
common initiates see in the Masonic Temples, are reproduced
in the meeting rooms of the Luciferians, but they no longer
mean Jakin, Bohaz, Mahabone, as in the Lodges, nor Jacques
Bourguignon Molay, as with the Knights Kadosch ; in
Theurgy these three letters mean ; Jesus Bethlemitus
Maledictus. Theurgy is therefore pure Satanism. " 5
" Moreover it is important to note that the Cabalists,
admitted to the mysteries of Theurgy, never mention the word
Satan. They look upon certain dissident adepts who invoke
the devil under the name of Satan as heretics, whose system
they call Goety or Black Magic. They call their own practices
Theurgy or White Magic. "6
Between these two types of Devil worshippers, the
Luciferian occultists and the Satanists, there is a difference
which must not be overlooked.
Luciferians never call their infernal master " Spirit of Evil"
or " Father and Creator of Crime ". Albert Pike even forbade
the use of the word Satan under any circumstances.
There is indeed a distinction between the Satanists and
Luciferians. The Satanists, described by Mr. Huys-mans in
his book, Let Bas, are chiefly persons mentally deranged by
the use and abuse of drugs who, while

THEOCRASY

suffering from a peculiar form of hysteria, accuse the God of
the Christians of having betrayed the cause of humanity. They
are persons who recognize that their God Satan occupies a
position in the supernatural sphere, inferior to that of the
Christian deity. On the other hand the Luciferians or the
initiates of kindred rites, while still labouring under a strange
delusion, act deliberately and glorify Lucifer as the principle
of good. To them he is the equal of the God of the Christians
whom they describe as the principle of evil.
It is necessary to recognize the distinction which exists
between Luciferians and Satanists, for their two cults bear
each other no resemblance, although Lucifer-Satan manifests
indiscriminately to his faithful followers of both
denominations. One must not, however, imagine that the pride
and satisfaction he derives from this adulation acts as an
inducement to making him appear whenever he is called !
Occultists of all schools agree that nothing is more capricious
than the conduct of spirits when evoked !
It is well moreover to remember that Luciferian occultism
is no novelty, nor must one make the mistake of confusing it
with ordinary Freemasonry, the Lodges of which are only
private clubs. 7
Many authors have published books on Freemasonry, some
printing the rituals, some their personal observations on
certain facts, but few of these authors, having themselves
passed into occult masonry, the real masonry of the Cabalistic
degrees which is in touch with all secret societies, Masonic as
well as non-Masonic, have been able to state that Luciferian
Occultism controls Freemasonry.
Though this is indeed the case, neither the President

of the Council of the Order of the Grand Orient of France, the
supreme chief of French Freemasonry, nor the president of the
Supreme Council of Scottish Rites will be received at the
meeting of a simple Luciferian ceremony just on account of
his title and dignity unless, at the same time, he possesses a
diploma of Cabalistic grade which requires another initiation.
On the other hand, the first Oddfellow from Canada, a
member of the Chinese San-ho-hui of China, a Luciferian
Fakir from India, all these can visit at their pleasure all lodges
and inner shrines of ordinary Freemasonry in all countries
because, in each one of the Satanic sects, the directing
authority is exercised by heads who belong to the most exalted
masonic degrees of the different rites, degrees which are for
them of secondary importance. These chiefs, at the request of
their subordinates of the Luciferian societies, deliver to them
freely the diplomas necessary to obtain admittance
everywhere, as well as the sacred words and yearly and half
yearly pass-words of all the masonic rites of the globe. 8
Luciferian Occultism, as has been said before, is therefore
not a novelty, but it bore a different name in the early days of
Christianity. It was called Gnosticism and its founder was
Simon the Magician.
The Gnostics were not ordinary heretics but constituted an
anti-christian sect. To deceive the multitude, they affected
disagreement with certain doctrines of the Apostles, and the
chiefs selected from among the initiates those destined to
receive, in secret council, the Satanic revelation. Gnosticism
is marked with the seal of Lucifer. It is contemporary with the
Apostle Peter and has continued, without interruption, down
to the present day, periodically changing its mask.
8. Bataille, op. cit., p. 36.

34

OCCULT THEOCRASY

The seven founders of Freemasonry were all Gnostics,
Magi of the English Rose Croix, whose names were :
Theophile Desaguliers, named Chaplain of the Prince of
Wales by George II, Anderson, the clergyman, an Oxford
graduate and preacher to the King of England, George Payne,
James King, Calvert, Lumden-Madden, and Elliott.
Gnosticism, as the Mother of Freemasonry, has imposed its
mark in the very centre of the chief symbol of this association.
The most conspicuous emblem which one notices on entering
a masonic temple, the one which figures on the seals, on the
rituals, everywhere in fact, appears in the middle of the
interlaced square and compass, it is the five pointed star
framing the letter G. Different explanations of this letter G are
given to the initiates. In the lower grades, one is taught that it
signifies Geometry. To the brothers frequenting the lodges
admitting women as members, it is revealed that the mystic
letter means Generation, but the revelation is attended with
great secrecy. Finally, t6 those found worthy to penetrate into
the sanctuary of Knights Kadosch, the enigmatic letter
becomes the initial of the doctrine of the perfect initiates
which is Gnosticism. This explanation is no longer an imaginary fabrication. It is Gnosticism which is the real meaning of
the G in the flamboyant star, for, after the grade of Kadosch (a
Hebrew word meaning consecrated) the Freemasons dedicate
themselves to the glorification of Gnosticism (or
anti-christianity) which is defined by Albert Pike as " the soul
and marrow of Freemasonry. " 9

flamboyant star signifies Gnosticism and Generation, the most
sacred words of the ancient Cabala. " See Eliphas Levi, Dogme et
Rituel cle la Haute Magie, vol. II, p. 97.

THE MEANING OF OCCULTISM

Let us add that the ancient mysteries of Gnosticism have
been known and published in the past. There is no difference
between the Gnosticism of the early ages of Christianity and
modern occultism.
The fundamental principle of Gnosticism was the double
divinity (dual principle) and this is exactly the theological
theory of modern occultism. The Gnostics claimed that the
good God was Lucifer and that Christ was the devil, that what
the Christians call vice was for them virtue, and to the
Christian dogma they opposed Gnosticism, a word meaning
human knowledge.
Early Gnosticism had its doctors ; the Basilideans, Ophites
and Valentinians. Basilide of Alexandria, one of them, lived
at the end of the first century. He taught metempsychosis and
the principles underlying present-day Theosophy. His system
resembles that of the spiritists of the nineteenth century who
have invented nothing, for they copy Gnosticism even in its
theory of the transmigration of souls. Basilide affirmed that he
was the reincarnation of Plato. Whoever has penetrated into
assemblies of modern theurgists can attest that one of its
current theories is that of reincarnation.
After Basilide came Montanus who died in 212. Montanus
was a grand master of the art of divination. The Bite of
Mizraim (a Freemasonry said to be Egyptian) copies slavishly,
in its Cabalistic grades, all the phantasmagoria of Montanus.
This Gnostic doctor plunged himself into ecstasies and,
according to history, he had two women, Maximilla and
Priscilla, trained to act as his accomplices. The Gnostics came
in crowds to admire their contortions worthy of epileptics.
They had the sacred illness, 10 and were considered two
saints of

authors) consecrated most kinds of Distempers of the Body,
and Affections of the Mind; erected Temples and Altars to

Satan. In the assemblies of the sect, when they went into
frenzies and prophesied, their oracular sayings were listened
to with veneration by the adepts.
Were they acting a part, were they just mediums or
somnambulists, or were they what the Roman Catholics call "
possessed " ?
This is a hard question to answer.
A modern example of the influence exercised by occult
organizations on the destinies of mankind is to be found in the
history of The Holy Alliance, founded in 1815 by Alexander I,
Emperor of Russia. This was originally a union of monarchs
pledged to support the Christian Church and to stem the rising
tide of radicalism, revolution and subversion.
In L'Histoire de la Magie (p. 467), Eliphas Levi states that
the spiritist sect of " The Rescuers of Louis XVI ", wishing to
penetrate this organization to use it for their own purposes,
succeeded in insinuating one of their illumines into the good
graces of the Czar. This was Madame Bouche, known to the
adepts as Sister Salome. After eighteen months spent at the
Russian Court, during which she had many secret interviews
with the Emperor, she was supplanted by another
medium-somnambulist of the sect, the famous Madame de
Krudner who acquired so great an influence
Fevers. Paleness. Madness, and Death ; to Laughter, Lust, Contumely,
Impudence, and Calumny. Every strange Disorder, as well as Epilepsy, is
the Sacred Disease. Sua cuique Deus sit dira Cupido (Each bold Fancy
grows into a God).
" But it must be remembered this Distemper was called also Morbus
Comitialis ; because if any one fell into it, during the Assembly, it was a
fatal Omen, and they immediately broke up ".
Bishop Lavington, The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists compared,
p. 123.

over the Czar that his ministers became alarmed at the
situation thus created. Levi thus describes the fall of the
favorite ;
" One day, as the emperor was leaving her, she barred his
passage crying ' God reveals to me that your life is in great
danger. An assassin is in the palace. ' The Emperor, alarmed,
caused the palace to be searched and a man, armed with a
dagger, was found. He confessed, when questioned, that he
had been introduced into the palace by Madame de Krudner
herself. '
One wonders if the whole affair was not simply the result
of a clever intrigue calculated to get rid of the prophetess. As
such it was singularly successful for Madame de Krudner was
summarily banished from the Russian Court.
In De la Magonnerie Occulte (pp. 87-88), J. M. Ragon tells
us that " science counts four kinds of Somnambulism : The
natural, the symptomatic, the magnetic and the ecstatic.
" Natural and symptomatic somnambulism are two
essentially different states, one occurring only at night, the
other by day as well as by night. The conduct of the subject is
different under the two conditions.
" Magnetic and ecstatic somnambulism differ from one
another insomuch as the one is commanded (willed) and the
other is not. The first is artificial, the other natural. In the first,
the subject is dependent; in the second, he acts independently.
That is why induced somnambulism cures the natural when
substituted for it.
" A lucid somnambulist bears no more resemblance to a
man asleep than he does to an active man awake ".
When the Gnostics practised magic, they evoked the spirits
of the dead exactly as do the occultists of

today. Dawning Christianity was prolific in miracles so, in
order to fight it, the disciples of Gnosticism had recourse to
diabolical marvels. In this respect, are not contemporaneous
spiritists, with their rapping tables and apparitions, Gnostics
under another name ?
Secret Gnostic meetings lead to depravity, as the adepts
indulge in every kind of turpitude and obscenity, often under
the influence of drugs such as Indian Hemp (Cannabis indica)
or Opium, the medicinal properties of which, when
administered under certain conditions, are provocative of
mediumistic phenomena.
Thus debauched, their moral sense weakened, initiates are
ready to work. They work, they fall, and, as they fall the
Occult power grasps its prey. Their life, henceforth, is subject
to the will of the Hidden Masters who, according to their
secret designs, will lead their slaves to power, or a semblance
of power, or else to their downfall. To use the words of "
Inquire Within " in Light-bearers of Darkness (p. 118) ... "
These masters
— doubtless identical with the terrible power behind the
horrors of Russia's sufferings and World Revolution
— have in reality no interest in soul or astral development,
except as a means of forming passive illuminised tools,
completely controlled in mind and actions. " n
" Inquire Within " further suggests that there is " a group of
flesh-and-blood men, who can form etheric links, from any
distance, with the leaders of these societies and who secretly
work by means of that light which can * slay or make alive ',
intoxicating, blinding, and, if need be, destroying unwary men
and women, using them as instruments or ' Light-bearers ' to
bring to pass this mad and evil scheme of World
11. This refers to Gnostic Secret Societies described in this
book.

Dominion by the God-People —the Cabalistic Jew. " 12
A further explanation of the phenomenon of induced
mediumship is given us by the same author who quotes
the following lines from Eliphas Levi's History of Magic:
" This may take place when, through a series of almost
impossible exercises... our nervous system, having been habituated to all tensions and fatigues, has become a kind of living
galvanic pile, capable of condensing and projecting powerfully
that Light (astral) which intoxicates and destroys.
" Inquire Within " comments further :
" It attempts to show that it leads to mastership and self
control, but on careful consideration it proves to be merely
conscious mediumship inspired by crafty and wilful deception,
giving the adept a false confidence, inducing him to let go his
physical senses and work upon the astral, where, enclosed by
formulae given by these masters themselves, he is completely
at their mercy. "
A recent practical illustration of these methods is the
teaching contained in a book Asia Mysteriosa by Zam
Bhotiva, (published by Dorbon Aine) which suggests ways
and means of communication with the " Hidden Masters ".
It will be recognised by anyone having taken an interest in
the progress of science along certain lines that there is nothing
impossible or even improbable in the suggestion that
telepathy may be exploited by organisations for their own
particular ends.
Forty years ago William Gay Hudson wrote on telepathy as
follows :
If the power exists in man to convey a telepathic
message to his fellow-man, it presupposes the existence of
12. " Inquire Within " op. cit., pp. 116-117.

40

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the power in the percipient to repeat the message to a third
person, and so on indefinitely, until some one receives it who
has the power to elevate the information above the threshold
of his consciousness, and thus convey it to the objective
intelligence of the world. Nor is the element of time
necessarily an adverse factor in the case ; for there is no reason
to suppose that such messages may not be transmitted from
one to another for generations. Thus, the particulars of a
tragedy might be revealed many years after the event, and in
such a way as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to trace
the line through which the intelligence was transmitted. For
the spiritist the easy and ever-ready explanation of such a
phenomenon is to ascribe it to the intervention of spirits of the
dead. But to those who have kept pace with the developments
of modern scientific investigation, and who are able to draw
the legitimate and necessary conclusions from the facts
discovered, the explanation is obvious, without the necessity
of entering the domain of the supernatural. "13
On the subject of Hypnotism and Crime, Hudson, writing
further, reaches however a fatally false conclusion which for
many years remained unchallenged. He states (p. 140) " It is
true that, on ordinary questions, the truth is always uppermost
in the subjective mind. A hypnotic subject will often say,
during the hypnotic sleep, that which he would not say in his
waking moments. Nevertheless, he never betrays a vital
secret... That this is true is presumptively proved by the fact
that in all the years during which the science of hypnotism has
been practised, no one has ever been known to betray the
secrets of any society or order. The attempt has often been
made, but it has never succeeded. "
Hudson attributes this reticence to auto-suggestion
13. Hudson, The Law of Psychic Phenomena, p. 236.

THE MEANING OF OCCULTISM

41

opposing the suggestion of another. This however is not the case, for,
where a member of a secret society or order is concerned, that
member was already hypnotized during initiation and it is not his
will that guards the secret," it is the will of another, the will of the
Lodge.
How many people know that hypnotism is about all there is to
initiation ? Hypnotism and fear. The rest is camouflage.
In the event of this statement being doubted, we quote herewith
from Freemasonry Universal an article which needs no further
comment: 14
" The Stewards prepare the candidate ; the Tyler first, and
afterwards in turn the I. G., Deacons and Junior Wardens should
inspect the candidate to see that everything is strictly correct.
" The preparation symbolises poverty, blindness (or ignorance)
and poverty of spirit, — but it may also signify a purification, i.e.,
that the riches and pleasures which bind one to the material side of
life are discarded and the spirit blinded to their attractions. The
baring of the right arm, left breast, left knee and right heel being
slipshod, are apparently a reference to the awakening of occult
centres in one's being which may only become active when
purification of the whole nature has begun.
" The very specific character of the preparation points to real
knowledge of the occult physiology of the process of initiation on
the part of those who originated the method which has been so
faithfully preserved. Certain Forces are sent through the candidate's
body during the ceremony, especially at the moment when he is
created, received and constituted an Entered Apprentice Freemason.
Certain parts of the Lodge have been very heavily charged with
magnetic force especially in order that the Candidate may absorb as
much as possible of this force. The first object of
14. Freemasonry Universal vol. V, Part 2, Autumn Equinox,
1929, p. 58.

42

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

this curious method of preparation is to expose to this influence
those various parts of the body which are especially used in the
ceremony. In ancient Egypt, there was another reason for these
preparations, for a weak current of physical electricity was sent
through the candidate by means of a rod or sword with which
he was touched at certain points. It is partly on this account
that at this first initiation the candidate is deprived of all metals
since they may very easily interfere with the flow of the
currents. "
All kinds of nice inspiring symbolical interpretations of the
ritual are generally given for the benefit of people who seem to
want them, but it is here evident that the candidate, unknown
to himself or herself, has acted throughout the ceremony of
initiation under the stress of hypnotism. No longer a free agent,
the initiate takes the oath under hypnotic force which, has also
been used to instil into him the feeling of fear. Fear guards the
secret of initiation, fear born under the power of hypnotism to
serve henceforth as the controlling agent of the initiators over
the initiated.
The Right Worshipful Master must be a genuine occultist,
as it is up to him to charge (hypnotise) the candidate, for to
give this in the words of Freemasonry Universal : " The R. W.
M. gives the light, the pure white light of truth and
illumination. " 15
Illumination, alias Kundalini, alias Serpent power, alias
Electro-magnetic force, alias the Sex force, etc. !
Even in our western world any one wishing to study Hatha
Yoga can learn to neutralize the action of gravity and go some
yards up in the air. This stunt, and the assumption of any size
at will, are tricks for which training is essential, and if one
works at it hard enough, one will eventually be able to
mesmerise people for

43

one's own purposes, business, political or other, thus
following the lure of the occult to a sinister end i.e. Black
Magic. 16
We would here observe that the miracles performed by
Jesus Christ bore a distinctive feature, often overlooked,
namely, that in every case altruism was the source of their
inspiration. Thus they were a symbol of charity.
This gives us the esoteric explanation of His silence when
taunted on the cross. " He saved others, himself he cannot
save. " Sooner than use this power for personal advantage He
chose death !
Gnostic miracles, such as that of being buried alive for a
period of time which constitutes the Hindu religious rites of
Samadhi have no ulterior charitable purpose. They are chiefly
performed for the object of creating wonderment, curiosity or
faith in magic, and as such, failing the altruistic motive, are
classifiable under the general term of Black Magic.
As a stimulus to popular faith, they are, however,
sanctioned by most Pagan religions, though where such a
custom prevails, the magical performers themselves are not
privileged to withhold their gains for themselves, as these are
claimed by the Temple.
Having dealt with the preliminaries of the subject, we will
now proceed along the thorny paths of history — not the
history of wars, battles, heroes, but that of the agents of their
being !

III

BRAHMINISM

For a brief study of Brahminism, the religion practised in
India, we can hardly do better than quote from the work of
such recognized authorities as Messrs. Stillson and Hughan. '
In attempting to trace the origin of Brahminism, they make
the following observations :
" After being conquered by the Cuthites under Rama, the
son of Cush, referred to in Genesis x, 2, 7, the Mysteries of
the Deluge were introduced. The worship soon became
divided into two sects. We are not fully apprised when was
first introduced the Brahminic system, composed of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva, constituting the Trimurti... one branch of
which was mild and benevolent, and addressed to Vishnu, the
Preserver, while the other proclaimed the superiority of Siva,
who was called the Destroyer and the representative of terror
and penance, barbarity and blood ; in Egypt, represented by
Typhon.
" These Mysteries, whatever may have been their origin, or
for what purposes they were then instituted, were certainly a
corruption of the original worship of
1. Stillson and Hughan, The History of Freemasonry and Concordant
Orders, see the chapter entitled " Hindoostan ", p. 74 et seq.
44

BRAHMINISM

45

the one Deity. They bore a direct reference to the happiness of
Man in Paradise, where he was first placed ; his subsequent
deviations and transgressions, and the destruction of the race
by the general deluge... The great cavern of Elephanta,
perhaps the most ancient temple in the world made by man, in
which these rites were performed and remaining to the
present day, is an evidence of the magnitude of that system...
" The caverns of Salsette, of which there are three hundred,
all have within them carved and emblematic characters. The
different ranges of apartments are connected by open
galleries, and only by private entrances could the most secret
caverns, which contained the ineffable symbols, be
approached, and so curiously contrived as to give the highest
effect upon the neophytes when in the ceremonial of initiation.
A cubical cisia, used for the periodical sepulture of the
aspirant, was located in the most secret recesses of the cavern.
The consecrated water of absolution was held in a carved
basin in every cavern, and on the surface floated the flowers
of the lotus. The Linga or Phallus appeared everywhere most
conspicuous, and oftentimes in situations too disgusting to be
mentioned...
" Sacrifices to the sun, to the planets, and to household
gods, were made accompanied with ablutions of water,
purifications with dung and urine of the cow. This last was
because the dung was the medium by which the soil was made
fertile and reminded them of the doctrine of ' Corruption and
reproduction ' taught in the worship of Siva. "
An initiation is thus described :
" Amidst all the confusion, a sudden explosion was heard,
which was followed by a dead silence. Flashes of brilliant
light were succeeded by darkness. Phantoms and shadows of
various forms, surrounded by rays of

46

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

light, flitted across the gloom. Some with many hands, arms,
and legs; others without them; sometimes a shapeless trunk,
then a human body with the head of a bird, or beast, or a fish ;
all manner of incongruous forms and bodies were seen, and all
calculated to excite terror in the mind of the postulant.
" A gorgeous appearance, with unnumbered heads, each
having a crown set with resplendent jewels, one of which
excelled the others; his eyes gleamed like flaming torches, but
his neck, his tongues and his body were black ; the skirts of his
garments were yellow, and sparkling jewels hung in all of his
ears ; his arms were extended, and adorned with bracelets, and
his hands bore the holy shell; the radiated weapon, the war
mace, and the sacred lotus. This image represented
Mahadeva2 himself, in his character of the Destroyer. "
Among other learned authorities, writing on these subjects,
is Jacolliot who gives the following description of perverted
Brahminism :
" The study of philosophic truth does not relieve the
Nirvanys and Yogys from the necessity of the tapas-sas, or
bodily mortifications. On the contrary, it would
seem that they carry them to the greatest extremes.................
Everything that affects or consumes the body, everything that
tends to its annihilation, without actually destroying it, is
thought to be meritorious.
" Several centuries previous to the present era, however,
these bodily mortifications had assumed a character of
unusual severity. 3
" To the contemplative dreamers of the earliest ages in
India, who devoted the whole of their time to meditation, and
never engaged in practices involving phy2. Mafia (Sanscrit) = grand.

47

sical suffering oftener than once a week, had succeeded a class
of bigoted fanatics, who placed no limit to their religious
enthusiasm, and inflicted upon themselves the most terrible
tortures. 4
" A spiritual reaction, however, occurred, and those who
had been initiated into the higher degrees took that
opportunity to abandon the practice of the tapas-sas, or
corporal mortification. They sought rather to impress the
imagination of the people by excessive asceticism in
opposition to the laws of nature. A profound humility, an
ardent desire to live unknown by the world, and to have the
divinity as the only witness to the purity of their morals, took
possession of them, and though they continued the practice of
excessive abstemiousness, they did so perhaps more that they
might not seem to be in conflict with the formal teachings of
the sacred scriptures.
" That kind of austerity is the only one now enjoined upon
all classes of initiates.
" The Fakirs appear to have gradually monopolized all the
old modes of inflicting pain, and have carried them to the
greatest extremes. They display the most unbounded
fanaticism in their self-inflicted tortures upon all great public
festivals....
" The Nirvanys live in a constant state of ecstatic
contemplation, depriving themselves of sleep as far as
possible, and taking food only once a week, after sunset.
" They are never visible either in the grounds or inside the
temples, except on the occasion of the grand festival of fire,
which occurs every five years. On that day, they appear at
midnight upon a stand erected in the centre of the sacred
tank. They appear like

spectres, and the surrounding atmosphere is illumined by
them by means of their incantations. They seem to be in the
midst of a column of light rising from earth to heaven.5
" The seven degrees of initiation in the sacerdotal cast of
the Brahmins are : 6
Grihasta—or House-Master.
Pourohita—or Priest of Popular Evocations.
Fakir—Performing.
Sanyassis—or Naked Cenobites, Superior Exorcists.
Nirvanys—Naked Evocators.
Yogy s—Contemplative.
Brahmatma—Supreme Chief.
" Upon reaching the third degree of initiation, the Brahmins
were divided into tens, and a superior Guru, or professor of
the occult sciences, was placed over each decade. He was
revered by his disciples as a god.
" Seventy Brahmins more than seventy years old are chosen
from among the Nirvanys to see that the law of the Lotus, or
the occult science, is never revealed to the vulgar, and that
those who have been initiated into the sacred order are not
contaminated by the admission of any unworthy person. "
(Quoted from the Agrouchada-Parikchai).
" In addition to its attributes as an initiatory tribunal, the
council of the elders also had charge of administering the
pagoda property, from which it made provision for the wants
of its members (of the three classes) who shared everything in
common. It also directed the wanderings of the Fakirs, whose
duty it is to give manifestations of occult power outside.
It also elected the Brahmatma from its own members.

With regard to the rise to power of the Brahmin caste in
India, Mr. Jacolliot writes in Les Fils de Dieu :
" Doubtless, in the midst of this new society discontent and
discord were unavoidable. Happy in the power they had
secured, the chiefs of the Brahmins, however, had to consider
means for preserving and insuring it against a reversal of
popular favour. At this distance, it is impossible for us to
judge the mental influences at work during a period covering
about two thousand years, that is to say, from the day when
the priests united into a kind of corporation to the time when,
enjoying unchallenged authority, they published the Vedhas.
This was a collection of prayers and ancient ceremonies
interspersed with the texts necessary to maintaining their
supremacy under the name oiManou (Sanscrit meaning : wise
law giver), a new code of law which, rejecting all the ancient
customs of equality and dividing the people into castes,
invested the Brahmins with world power and established the
dogma of the Trimourti or Trinity of God, from which
eventually was to spring polytheism and a host of the most
monstrous superstitions.
" This religious revolution occurred about twelve thousand
years before our era, under the Brahmatma Vasichta-Richi.
" The Vedhas and Manou, collected and codified by the
Brahmins were given as coming from Brahma himself, and
anyone doubting the truth of this origin was liable to the
penalty of death. "
As among the Ancient Egyptians the teaching of
monotheism was restricted to the highest initiates alone.
Jacolliot emphasises this when he writes :
" The worship of the one God or Zeus unrevealed, reserved
to the priests, was forbidden to the lower

50

OCCULT THEOCRASY

classes, but three temples dedicated to the three persons-of the
Trimourti, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, opened their doors to the
adoration of the people, all of whom were allowed to select
one of the three personages of the trinity they would prefer
to worship. "
This division in religious worship which eventually led to
the caste system shows the power of theocratic tyranny, the
Brahmins, seeking to justify the method whereby the control
of the masses is vested in the hands of a few, when preaching
in the pagodas, even now say : " See how logical is this system
of division of the people into castes. It was formed in the
likeness of the divinity, Zeus, sovereign master of all things,
but taking no action himself. This is the Brahmin priest
Brahma, the God who creates, who acts, who directs, that is
the aristocrat or the prince ; Vishnu, the God who preserves,
that is the artisan, the merchant, who produces taxes,
preserving and assuring the prosperity of the State by his work
and industry. As for Siva, the terrible God, he keeps the
Soudra (peasant) in a state of humility and obedience
appropriate to his station in life.
" Another very important function appears however to have
been early assigned to him, on which much more stress is laid
in his (Siva) modern worship — that of destroyer — viz., the
character of a generative power, symbolized in the phallic
emblem (Linga) and in the sacred bull (Nandi), the favourite
attendant of the god. This feature being entirely alien from the
nature of the Vedic god, it has been conjectured with some
plausibility, that the Linga-worship was originally prevalent
among the non-Aryan population, and was thence introduced
into the worship of Siva. 7

One of the most curious facts in the Theocratic System
ruling India is that the principle of equality is evidenced only
in the teaching and practice of Occultism. Members of all
castes are admitted on the same footing to learn magic or
fakirism and compose the class known under the name of
Fakirs. This system of equality is similar to the brotherhood
principle and teaching of democracy advocated in
Freemasonry which was so effectively exploited in all the
lodges that fomented the French Revolution.
" As all castes are admitted to the congregation of the
Fakirs, the lowest of the soudras on entering it becomes the
equal of the Brahmins. In spreading the belief that whosoever
consented to enrol among the high initiates of the pagoda, and
to die for the faith, was transported to the abode of Brahma
without accomplishing further migration on earth or having to
pass through hell, the Brahmins provided for an inexhaustible
supply of fakirs. "
" Before entering the category of fakir, those who are
destined to illustrate the ceremonies of the cults by their
tortures and death, the new recruits practise the occult
sciences under the direction of initiated Brahmins in the
innermost recesses of the pagodas. "
While " there are indeed extraordinary phenomena in what
is termed by the Brahmins occult science, there are none
which cannot be explained and which are not in accordance
with the law of nature. "
" To become expert in magic, like the believers in the
philosophic doctrine of the Pitris, the pupil must learn, from a
magician whom the sorcerers call their Guru, the formulas of
evocation, by means of which the malign spirits are brought
into complete subjection.
" Some of these spirits the magician evokes in pre-

52

OCCULT THEOCRASY

ference to others, probably on account of their willingness to
do anything that may be required of them. "
" An intimate connection exists between the doctrine of the
ancient Jewish Cabalists and those of the Hindu votaries of
the Pitris — or spirits — whose scientific book is the
Agrouchada-parikchai. 8
" It would be impossible to enumerate the different drugs,
ingredients and implements that compose the stock-in-trade
of a magician. " 9
The standard Indian book on magic is the Oupnek'hat.
Therein is to be found a detailed description of methods
available for producing catalepsy, somnambulism,
hallucination and ecstasy by strength of will and fatigue of the
nervous system. 10
This is what is known to the modern common-sense mortal
as " Yogi stuff ", and it is mostly based on breathing
exercises.
We will now quote from Mr. Sellon :
" It is a little remarkable that of the host of Divinities,
especially in Bengal, Siva is the God whom they are
especially delighted to honour. As the Destroyer, and one who
revels in cruelty and bloodshed, this terrible deity, who has
not inaptly been compared to the Moloch of Scripture, of all
their Divinities suggests most our idea of the Devil. It may
therefore be concluded that the most exalted notion of
worship among the Hindus is a service of Fear. The Brahmins
say that the other Gods are good and benevolent, and will not
hurt their creatures, but that Siva is powerful and cruel, and
that it is necessary to appease him.

" Although this deity is sometimes represented in the
human form in his images, it is not thus that he is most
frequently adored. The most popular representation of him is
unquestionably the Linga ; a smooth stone rising out of
another stone of finer texture, simulacrum membri virilis, et
pudendum muliebre. This emblem is identical with Siva in his
capacity of 'Lord of all.' n
" It is necessary, however, to observe here that Professor
Wilson, while admitting that ' the Linga is perhaps the most
ancient object of homage adopted in India', adds, '
subsequently to the ritual of the Vedhas, which was chiefly, if
not wholly, addressed to the Elements, and particularly to fire.
How far the worship of the Linga is authorized by the Vedhas
is doubtful, but that it is the main purport of several of the
Puranas there can be no doubt.' 12
" The worship of Siva under the type of the Linga is almost
the only form in which that deity is reverenced. Its prevalence
throughout the whole tract of the Ganges as far as Benares is
sufficiently conspicuous. In Bengal, the Lingam Temples are
commonly erected in a range of six, eight, or twelve on each
side of a Ghaut leading to the river. At Kalma is a circular
group of one hundred and eight temples erected by the Rajah
of Burdwan. These temples, and indeed all those found in
Bengal, consist of a simple chamber of a square form
surmounted by a pyramidal centre ; the area of each is very
small. The Linga of black or white marble, and sometimes of
alabaster slightly tinted and gilt, is placed in the middle. " 13

the Hindus, p. 8.

" Benares is the peculiar seat of this form of worship. The
principal Deity, Siva, there called Viweswarra, is a Linga ;
and most of the chief objects of pilgrimage are similar blocks
of stone. No less than forty-seven Lingas are visited, all of
preeminent sanctity; but there are hundreds of inferior note
still worshipped, and thousands whose fame and fashion have
passed away. It is a singular fact, that upon this adoration of
the procreative and sexual Sacti (or power) seen "throughout
nature, hinges the whole gist of the Hindu faith. 14
" Bacchus or Osiris was represented by an equilateral
triangle, and the sectarian mark of the worshippers of Siva is
this hieroglyphic. The worship of Bacchus was the same as
that which is paid to Siva, it had the same obscenities, the
same cruel bloodthirsty rites, and the same emblem of the
generative power. 15
" Durga, Kali, or Maha Kali as the Sacti, spouse or
energetic will of Siva, the destructive power, bears a
remarkable analogy with the Moloch of Scripture, as well as
with Typhon, Saturn, Dis, Pluto, and other divinities of the
West. 16
" When the attributes of the Supreme Being began to be
viewed in the light of distinct individuals, mankind attached
themselves to the worship of the one or the other exclusively,
and arranged themselves into sects : the worshippers of Siva
introduced the doctrine of the eternity of matter. In order to
reconcile the apparent contradiction of assigning the attribute
of creation to the principle of Destruction, they asserted
that the
14. Ibid., p. 12.

BRAHMINISM

55

dissolution and destruction of bodies was not real with respect
to matter, which was in itself indestructible, although its
modifications were in a constant succession of mutation ; that
the power must necessarily unite in itself the attributes of
creation and apparent destruction ; that this power and matter
are two distinct and co-existent principles in nature ; the one
active, the other passive ; the one male, the other female; and
that creation was the effect of the mysterious union of the two.
" This Union is worshipped under a variety of names :
Bhava, Bhavani, Mahadeva, Mahamaya, etc. Thus the
attribute of creation was usurped from Brahma, by the
followers of Siva, to adorn and characterise their favourite
divinity. "
" This seems to have been a popular worship for a great
length of time, out of which sprang two sects : the one
personified the whole Universe and dispensations of
providence (in the regulation of it) under the name of Prakriti,
and which we from the Latin call nature. This sect retains the
Sacti only, and were the originators of the Sactas sects, or
worshippers of Power. The other sect took for their symbol the
Male emblem (Linga) unconnected with the female Sacti (or
Yoni). There was also a third sect, who adored both male and
female.
" According to Theodoret, Arnobius, and Clemens of
Alexandria, the Yoni of the Hindus was the sole object of
veneration in the mysteries of Eleusis.17
" It is not only the votaries of Siva who adore their God
under the symbolic form of the Linga; the Vaishnavas, or
followers of Vishnu, use the same
17. ibid., p. 23.

56

medium. They also are Lingayetts, one of the essential
characteristics of which is wearing the Type on some part of
their dress or person. 18
" The Vaishnavas are divided into many sects. They
comprise the Ghoculasthas, the Yonijas, the Ramani, and
Radha-balluthis.
" The Ghoculasthas adore Krishna, while the Ramani
worship Rama ; both have again branched into three sects —
one consists of the exclusive worshippers of Krishna, and
these only are deemed true and orthodox Vaishnavas... As
Parameswarra, Krishna is represented of a black or dark blue
colour. Now the Tulasi is the black Ocymum, and all animals
or vegetables of a black or blue colour are sacred to him. His
linga also is always either black or dark blue, and may thus be
distinguished from that of Siva, which is generally white.
" This divinity, as Parameswarra, is Janan'nauth
(Juggernaut), or ' Lord of the Universe ', and it is under the
wheels of his sacred car that so many misguided beings
annually immolated themselves.
" To return, however, to the Vaishnavas. Another of their
sects adore Krishna and his mistress Radha united. These are
the Lingionijas, whose worship is perhaps the most free of all
the Pujas. A third, the Radha-ballubhis, dedicate their
offerings to Radha only. The followers of these last
mentioned sects have adopted the singular practice of
presenting to a naked girl the oblation intended for the
Goddess, constituting her the living impersonation of Radha.
Rut when a female is not to be obtained for this purpose, the
votive offerings are made to an image of the Yoni, or emblem
of the feminine power. These worshippers are called
18. Ibid., p. 40.

Yonijas, in contradistinction to the Lingayats, or adorers of
the Krishna (Vishnu) Linga.
" As the Saivas are all worshippers of Siva and Bowannee
(Pavati) conjointly, so the Vaishnavas also offer up their
prayers to Laksmi-Nayarana. The exclusive adorers of this
Goddess are the Sactas.
" The caste mark of the Saivas and Sactas consists of three
horizontal lines on the forehead with ashes obtained, if
possible, from the hearth on which a consecrated fire is
perpetually maintained. The adoration of the Sacti is quite in
accordance with the spirit of the mythological system of the
Hindus. It has been computed that, of the Hindus in Bengal, at
least three-fourths are Sactas, of the remaining fourth, three
parts are Vaishnavas, and one, Saivas.
" Independently of the homage paid to the principal Deities,
there are a great variety of inferior beings, Dewtas, and
demi-gods of a malevolent character and formidable aspect,
who receive the worship of the multitude. The bride of Siva,
however, in one or other of her many and varied forms, is by
far the most popular goddess in Bengal and along the Ganges.
" The worship of the female generative principle, as
distinct from the Divinity, appears to have originated in the
literal interpretation of the metaphorical language of the
Vedhas, in which Will, or purpose to Create the Universe, is
represented as originating from the Creator and co-existent
with him as his bride, and part of himself. "
" Although the adoration of the Sacti (the personified
energy of the Omnipotent) is authorized by some of the
Puranas, the rites and formulae are more clearly set forth in a
voluminous collection of books called Tantras.
These
writings convey their meaning in the

58

OCCULT THEOCRASY

similitude of dialogue between Uma (or Siva) and Pavati.
" The followers of the Tantras profess to consider them as a
fifth Vedh, and attribute to them equal antiquity
and
superior authority. "
" The Tantras are too numerous to specify them further,
but the curious reader will find them under the heads of
Syama Rahasya, Anandra, Rudra, Yamala, Mandra,
Mahodahi, Sareda, Tilika, and Kalika-Tantras.
" Although any of the goddesses may be objects of the
Sacta worship, and the term Sacti comprehends them all, yet
the homage of the Sactas is almost restricted, in Bengal, to the
consort of Siva. The Varnis, or Vamacharis, worship Devi as
well as all goddesses. Their worship is derived from a portion
of the Tantras.
" According to the immediate object of the worshipper is
the particular form of worship ; but all the forms require the
use of some or all of the five Makaras — Mansa, Matsya,
Madya, Maithuna, and Mudra — that is : flesh, fish, wine,
women, and certain mystical gesticulations with the fingers.
Suitable Muntrus, or incantations, are also indispensable,
according to the end proposed, consisting of various
unmeaning monosyllabic combinations of letters, of great
imaginary efficacy.
" When the object of worship is to acquire an interview
with, and control over, impure spirits, a dead body is
necessary. The adept is also to be alone, at midnight, in a
cemetery or place where bodies are burnt. Seated on the
corpse he is to perform the usual offerings, and if he do so
without fear or disgust, the Dhutas, the Yoginis, and other
male and female demons become his slaves. 19
" In this and many of the observances practised,
19. Bataille, LeDiable au XIXs siecle, for fanciful description
of such rites.

BRAHMINISM

59

solitude is enjoined, but all the principal ceremonies
comprehend the worship of Sacti, or Power, and require, for
that purpose, the presence of a young and beautiful girl, as the
living representative of the goddess. This worship is mostly
celebrated in a mixed society ; the men of which represent
Bhairavas, or Viras, and the women, Bhanravis and Nayikas.
The Sacti is personified by a naked girl, to whom meat and
wine are offered, and then distributed among the assistants.
Here follows the chanting of the Muntrus and sacred texts, and
the performance of the Mudra, or gesticulations with the
fingers. The whole terminates with orgies amongst the
votaries of a very licentious description. This ceremony is
entitled the Sri Chakra or Purna-bisheka, The Ring or full
Initiation. 20
" This method of adoring the Sacti is unquestionably
acknowledged by the texts regarded by the Vanis as
authorities for the impurities practised.
" The members of the sect are sworn to secrecy, and will
not therefore acknowledge any participation in Sacta-Puja.
Some years ago, however, they began to throw off this reserve,
and at the present day they trouble themselves very little to
disguise their initiation into its mysteries, but they do not
divulge in what those mysteries consist.
" The Kauchiluas are another branch of the Sactas sect;
their worship much resembles that of the Caulas. They are,
however, distinguished by one particular rite not practised by
the others, and throw into confusion all the ties of female
relationship ; natural restraints are wholly disregarded, and a
community of "women among the votaries inculcated.
" On the occasions of the performance of divine

worship, the women and girls deposit their " julies ", or
bodices, in a box in charge of the Guru, or priest. At the close
of the rites, the male worshippers take each a " julie " from the
box, and the female to whom it belongs, even were she his
sister, becomes his partner for the evening in these lascivious
orgies.
" In every temple of any importance in India we find a
troupe of Nautch or dancing girls attached.
" These women are generally procured when quite young,
and are early initiated into all the mysteries of their profession.
They are instructed in dancing and vocal and instrumental
music, their chief employment being to chant the sacred
hymns, and perform nautches before the God, on the
recurrence of high festivals. But this is not the only service
required of them, for besides being the acknowledged
mistresses of the officiating priests, it is their duty to
prostitute themselves in the courts of the temple to all comers,
and thus raise funds for the enrichment of the place of worship
to which they belong... A Nautch woman esteems it a peculiar
privilege to become the Radha Dea on such occasions. It is an
office indeed which these adepts are, on every account, better
calculated to fulfil with satisfaction to the sect of Sacteyas,
who require their aid, than a more innocent and
unsophisticated girl.
" The worship of Sacti is the adoration of Power, 21 which
the Hindus typify by the Yoni, or womb, the Argha or vulva,
and by the leaves and flowers of certain plants thought to
resemble it. 22
" In Ananda Tantram, cap. VII, 148, and other passages,
reference is made to Bhagamala. She appears
21. Author's note : Sex power = Kundalini, electro-magnetic
force, astral light, fire.
22. See Lotus-Padma, explanation in chapter on Symbolism.

BRAHMINISM

61

to be the goddess who presides over the pudendum muliebre,
i.e. the deified vulva ; and the Sacti is thus personified.
" Such are some of the peculiar features of the worship of
Power (or Gnosticism), and which, combined with the Linga
Puga (or adoration of the Phallus), constitutes at the present
day one of the most popular dogmas of the Hindus. "
Heckethorn tells us that the Maharajas constitute another
sect of priests and adds : " It appears abundantly from the
works of recognized authority written by Maharajas, and from
existing popular belief in the Vallabhacharya sect, that
Vallabhacharya is believed to have been an incarnation of the
god Krishna, and that the Maharajas, as descendants of
Vallabhacharya, have claimed and received from their
followers the like character of incarnations of that god by
hereditary succession. The ceremonies of the worship paid to
Krishna through these priests are all of the most licentious
character. The love and subserviency due to a Supreme Being
are here materialized and transferred to those who claim to be
the living incarnations of the god. Hence the priests exercise
an unlimited influence over their female votaries, who
consider it a great honour to acquire the temporary regard of
the voluptuous Maharajas, the belief in whose pretensions is
allowed to interfere, almost vitally, with the domestic
relations of husband and wife. " 23
Miss Mayo, in her book Mother India, published in 1927,
gives an interesting description of a temple of Kali. " Kali
Ghat " — place of Kali — is the root-word of the name
Calcutta. " Kali is a Hindu goddess,
23. Heckethorn, Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries, vol.
II, p. 307.

62

wife of the great god Siva, whose attribute is destruction and
whose thirst is for blood and death-sacrifice. "
Kali has thousands of temples in India, great and small.
Heckethorn further explains that " the association of Thugs,
after having existed in India for centuries, was only discovered
in 1810. The names by which the members were known to
each other, and also to others, was Funsiegeer, that is, ' men of
the noose '. The name Thug is said to be derived from thaga, to
deceive, because the Thugs get hold of their victims by luring
them into false security. One common mode of decoying
young men having valuables upon them is to place a young
and handsome woman by the wayside, and apparently in great
grief, who, by some pretended tale of misfortune, draws him
into the jungle, where the gang are lying in ambush, and on his
appearance strangle him. The gang consists of from ten to fifty
members ; and they will follow or accompany the marked-out
victim for days, nor attempt his murder until an opportunity,
offering every chance of success, presents itself. After every
murder they perform a religious ceremony, called Jagmi; and
the division of the spoil is regulated by old-established laws
— the man that threw the handkerchief gets the largest share,
the man that held the hands the next largest proportion, and so
on. In some gangs their property is held in common. Their
crimes are committed in honour of Kali who hates our race,
and to whom the death of man is a pleasing sacrifice. 24
" Kali, or Bhowany, for she is equally well known by both
names, was, according to the Indian legend, born of the
burning eye which Shiva has on his forehead,
24. Heckethorn, op. cit., p. 318, vol. II.

•whence she issued, like the Greek Minerva, out of the skull
of Jupiter, a perfect and full-grown being. She represents the
Evil Spirit, delights in human blood, presides over plague and
pestilence, and directs the storm and hurricane, and ever aims
at destruction. She is represented under the most frightful
effigy the Indian mind could conceive ; her face is azure,
streaked with yellow ; her glance is ferocious ; she wears her
dishevelled and bristly hair displayed like the peacock's tail
and braided with green serpents. Her purple lips seem
streaming with blood ; her tusk-like teeth descend over her
lower lip ; she has eight or ten arms, each hand holding some
murderous weapon, and sometimes a human head dripping
with gore. With one foot she stands on a human corpse. She
has her temples, in which the people sacrifice cocks and
bullocks to her, but her priests are the Thugs, the ' Sons of
Death ', who quench the never-ending thirst of this divine
vampyre. " 25
As regards the sect of Kali's worshippers, Hecke-thorn
gives the following details :
" A newly admitted member takes the appellation of
Sahib-Zada. He commences his infamous career as lughah, or
gravedigger, or as belhal, or explorer of the spots most
convenient for executing a projected assassination, or bhil. In
this condition he remains for several years, until he has given
abundant proof of his ability and good will. He is then raised
to the degree of Bhuttotah, or strangler, which advancement,
however, is preceded by new formalities and ceremonies. On
the day appointed for the ceremony, the candidate is
conducted by his guru into a circle, formed in the
25. Heckethorn, op. cit, vol. II, p. 318 and, for recent
corroboration, see Katherine Mayo, Mother India.

64

OCCULT THEOCRASY

sands and surrounded by mysterious hieroglyphics, where
prayers are offered up to their deity. The ceremony lasts four
days, during which the candidate is allowed no other food but
milk. He occupies himself in practising the immolation of
victims fastened to a cross erected in the ground. On the fifth
day the priest gives him the fatal noose, washed in holy water
and anointed with oil, and after more religious ceremonies, he
is pronounced a perfect bhuttotah. He binds himself by fearful
oaths to maintain the most perfect silence on all that concerns
the society, and to labour without ceasing towards the
destruction of the human race. He is the rex sacrificulus, and
the person he encounters, and Bhowany places in his way, the
victim. Certain persons, however, are excepted from the
attacks of the Thugs. " 26
The political significance of such a sect in any Theoc-rasy
can be easily understood when one realizes what it means to
the rulers of a land to have at their disposal a staff of fanatics
trained to kill anyone on the order of a priest! The utility of
such organizations is obvious in a hierarchy where the rulers
are also priests reigning by "Divine Right".

MAZDEISM
(Zoroastrianism)

While the origin of Mazdeism seems shrouded in mystery,
one may nevertheless recognize its antiquity, probably the
same as that of the Rig-Vedha, for it has been proved by
Eugene Bournouf and Spiegel that certain parts of the Avesta
are as old as the Rig, and the many similarities of this religion
with that of the Vedhas proves that Mazdeism must have had
its origin at the time when the Aryans undertook the conquest
of India, that is to say seventeen to eighteen centuries before
our era.
From Le Mazdeisme, I'avesta of G. de Lafont, we extract
the following facts : l The historic role of Media began with
Ouwakshatara, a name written by the Greeks Kyouxares, the
founder of the Median empire. After defeating the Scythians,
Kyouxares went to Assyria where he laid siege to Nineveh,
after the destruction of which the Assyrian empire came to an
end. (612 B. C.)
Kyouxares left a son Astyage whose daughter Man-dane
married the Persian Cambyses and from their

union sprang the great Cyrus the founder of the Persian
empire.
The Parthian dynasty of the Arsacides, who reigned from
256 B. C. until 226 A. D., marks a fatal period for Mazdeism.
It was only on the accession of Ardeschir Babejan, the
founder of the Sassanide dynasty, that Mazdeism regained its
strength. With Ardeshir, Mazdeism became the state religion
and Shapour II caused all the Avesta texts treating of
philosophy, medicine, cosmogony and astronomy to be
collected.
Under the last Sassanides appeared several heretical sects,
the most celebrated of which were those of Manes and of
Mazdeck. However, in the seventh century, came the Arab
conquest; with Yesdegirt the Persian empire of the
Sassanides disappeared and with it the influence of
Mazdeism.
Towards the tenth century, a few thousand Persians,
faithful to the old cult, went into exile taking with them their
laws and altars. Some of these took refuge in the Kirman in
the Yezd while the others fled to India where they now
constitute the well known sect of the Parsees.
The Zend Avesta, the sacred book of Persia and of the
modern Parsees, contains the teaching of Zoroaster
(Zarathustra), a reformer, said to have lived some 7000 years
before Christ. It was first translated into French by
Hyacinthe-Anquetil Duperron in 1761.
The Chevalier de Ramsay, giving Plutarch as his authority,
says : — " Zoroaster taught that there are two Gods contrary
to each other in their Operations, the one the Author of all the
Good, the other of all the Evil in Nature. The good Principle
he calls Oro-mazes, (Ahura-Mazda) the other the Daemon
Arima-nius (Agra-Mainyus). He says that the one resembles
Light and Truth, the other Darkness and Ignorance.

MAZDEISM

67

There is likewise a middle God between these two named
Mythras, whom the Persians call the Intercessor or Mediator.
Mythras is the Yazata (spirit) of light and the guardian of
justice and truth. "
For the benefit of the reader we compile the following
interesting information from the previously mentioned author,
G. de Lafont :
Pure Zoroastrianism was monotheistic, for in the beginning
Ahura-Mazda was recognized as infinitely more powerful
than Agra-Mainyus, thus dualism, or the potential equality of
these two deities, was actually the development of a later
corruption of the Zoroas-trian teaching.
The Avesta, the bible of Mazdeism, containing the
revelations of Ahura-Mazda to the Prophet Zoroaster, is
composed of two principal parts — the Avesta, containing the
Vendidad, the Yacnca and the Vispered, and the Khorda
Avesta, or little Avesta, itself composed of six parts.
Mazdeism taught the immortality of the soul, a
compensating justice in another world of Heaven or Hell, the
resurrection of the body, the last judgment and the freedom of
the soul to choose between right and wrong as a free agent, as
opposed to the Islamic theory of fatalism.
Oromazes is the Universal Creator of all that is good,
eternal, he created the Good Genii, the spiritual and material
world ; man is his creature, and at the end of time he will
resurrect him to endow him with eternal happiness and will
cause the powers of evil and evil itself to vanish from the
earth. No cult is rendered to Agra-Mainyus (Lucifer) who,
with his Devas (evil spirits) fights Ahura-Mazda (God)
through the ages.
Fire, in the Mazdean religion, was worshipped as

68

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the luminous and pure element, the work of Ahura-Mazda and
for that reason always burns sheltered from defilement. But it
is not material fire that in this case is to be considered as a
Yazata. The Avesta distinguishes several kinds of fire :
1. Berezucavanha, or internal fire of the earth.
2. Vohufryana or fire of the human body and animals.
(Kundalini, Sex-force, Serpent Power).
3. Urvazista or fire of vegetation.
4. Vazista or fire of lightning.
5. Cpenista or fire of Ahura-Mazda, represented by the fire
on the Altar.
The Fravashis (modern Ferouers) are supposed to be the
souls of the dead deified. Their cult also forms the basis of the
Ancestor worship, of the Pitris of India and the Manes of
Latin Countries.
According to Geiger, by " Fravashis " must be understood
the immortal, divine part in man, which unites with a body for
a limited time only. Consequently there are Fravashis of those
who are dead, of those who are living, and of those who are
still unborn. Darmstater further explains that the Fravashis are
the spiritual form of a being, independent of its material life
and anterior to it. According to Mazdean teaching, Oromazes
offered to the Ferouers of men the choice of remaining in the
spiritual world or of descending on earth to incarnate in
human bodies.
At the advent of death, corpses were supposed immediately
to become the prey of the Demon Druge Nacus, the demon of
the impurity of corpses. Thus, it being most essential never to
allow the elements of fire, water and earth to be sullied by
contact with anything unclean, the funeral rites and
ceremonies of the Mazdeans differ from those of other
religions.

MAZDEISM

69

Their ancient customs persist today among the Parsees of
India where the bodies of the dead are carried to " The Towers
of Silence " there to be exposed and devoured by the birds of
prey.
Besides the many other parallels between Mazdeism and
Christianity, the deity of the Mazdeans, their personal God,
Ahura-Mazda, was not a god of vengeance as was the
Jehovah of the Jews. He was the essence of universal love,
charity, justice and activity and the ideal of Mazdean virtue in
early times was similar to that of the Christians of today.

JAINISM

Jainism, which like Buddhism denies the authority of the
Vedhas and is therefore regarded by the Brahmins of India as
heretical, may have been founded by Parsva whose death is
placed at 250 years before that of Vardhamana Mahavira, the
last of the prophets of the Jains and a contemporary of
Buddha.
Vardhamana Mahavira died at the age of 72 at Pava 527 B.
C. He had eleven disciples to whom he preached the law.
Many authorities however believe the Jain Church to be as
old as Brahminism itself.
The following paragraph quoted from Hastings'
Encyclopaedia of Religions and Ethics, article on Jainism,
describes the Jain theory of the Transmigration of Souls as
opposed to the orthodox theory of Reincarnation. It is here
referred to as " a peculiarity of the Jains which had struck all
observers more than any other, viz. their extreme carefulness
not to destroy any living being, a principle which is carried
out to its very last consequences in monastic life, and has
shaped the conduct of the laity in a great measure.

70

OCCULT THEOCRASY

No layman will intentionally kill any living being, not even an
insect, however troublesome : he will remove it carefully
without hurting it. It goes without saying that the Jains are
strict vegetarians. This principle of not hurting any living
being bars them from some professions, e. g. agriculture, and
has thrust them into commerce and especially into its least
elevating branch of money-lending. Most of the money
lending in Western India is in the hands of the Jains, and this
accounts in a great measure both for their unpopularity and for
their wealth. A remarkable institution of the Jains, due to their
tender regard for animal life, is their asylums for old and
diseased animals, the pan-jarapolas, where they are kept and
fed till they die a natural death. "
The reluctance on the part of an orthodox Jain to discourage
vermin on the theory that a louse may actually be his
reincarnated grandmother or a scorpion some other
reincarnated relative is only a logical development of his
religious belief in the transmigration of souls.
The Jains are subdivided today into numerous schools each
following the teachings of a certain master but united in
certain fundamental beliefs.

CONFUCIANISM AND TAOISM

Previous to the Christian era, China, judging from the
available annals, presented the spectacle of a country whose
social life was based almost solely on what might be called
the family cult. The metaphysical tradition, overshadowing
the life of the people, leading to a monotheistic belief in a
Supreme Being, was the knowledge and belief of a few.
Vaguely, the people believed that the Monarch alone held
communication with the Sublime Sovereign or God. The rites
had nothing of a religious character, they were purely social.
Then in 1122 B. C, when the Chinese dynasty of Chang-Yin
was overthrown by the Tcheou, there were introduced in
China numerous innovations, most of them appertaining to
magic and occultism, also brahminic and avestic dogmas and
beliefs. The whole construction of social ideology in China
had undergone a slow but radical change. The ground was
prepared for the pantheistic teaching of the philosopher
Lao-Tse whose doctrine was bitterly fought by Confucius
(551-479) who opposed the dualist theory, and strove to
regenerate the former state of Chinese social life, the cult of
the family and ancestors. Moreover, the whole moral code
of Confucius was contained in a few
71

OCCULT THEOCRASY

words : loyalty and good feeling towards one's
neighbour.
Only in about 65 A. D. was Buddhism introduced in China,
followed in turn by Mazdeism, Manicheism and
Mahomedanism.

EGYPTIAN ESOTERISM

More than any other country, Ancient Egypt was an
illustration of theocratic power. There, priesthood ruled and
adumbrated royalty. Depositories of the Indo-Iran tradition of
Ra, Zarathustra and Manu, the priests of Thebes and
Memphis made of Egypt the fortress of antique esoterism.
Their Sovereign Lord God and Teacher bore the name of
Hermes or Thoth, the Great Initiator. In him were typified the
three great powers of royalty, law-giving or legislative and
high priesthood which made the Greeks, disciples of the
Egyptians, surname him Hermes Trismegistus or thrice great.
To Hermes was credited a large number of books
containing the secrets of Indo-Aryan occult science. Fire was
the first Principle, the basis of all teaching and the law of
Ammon-Ra, the Sun God of Thebes.
Only after the conquest of Egypt by the Hyksos (2000 B. C.)
did the priests spread among the people the cult of Osiris and
Isis and their son Horus. This popular religion served as a
screen which most effectively shielded the Hermetic
mysteries from intrusion and disclosure and safeguarded
ancient and Aryan esoterism which had to fear annihilation
at the hands of
73

74

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the priesthood of the black or Ethiopian race whose esoterism
was based upon a different conception of occult and psychic
knowledge.
A striking example of the rivalry of the two esoteric
schools is given in the Bible when Moses and Aaron,
practising the magic taught them by the Ethiopian Jethro,
failed to confound the Egyptian priests before Pharaoh.
Concealed behind the popular cult of Osiris and Isis was
the soul of Egyptian esoterism which no one could reach,
except after having been deemed worthy to penetrate the most
sacred mysteries of Isis whose statue, with its face veiled,
stood before the door of the temple of occultism.
The trials of initiation which a candidate had to withstand
before he beheld the light of Osiris and understood the "
Vision of Hermes " were long and terrible. They were
interspersed, however, by states of trance induced by special
beverages, during which the initiate had voluptuous visions of
Isis preceded by the five-pointed flamboyant star or the Rose
of Isis.
Two great flowing currents issued from the esoteric
wisdom, jealously safeguarded by the Egyptians, namely:
Mosaism or Judaism, taught by Moses whose God was
Jehovah, and Orpheism taught by Orpheus whose God was
Zeus or Jupiter. The former adapted his beliefs to suit the
mentality of undisciplined, rebellious masses of Israelites in
Egypt, hence a god of Fear and Vengeance ; the latter
legislated for a people whose hellenic genius touched sublime
heights of philosophic wisdom on the one hand, and sought on
the other to carry its irrepressible sense of beauty and
light-heartedness in its pursuit of material pleasures. Hence
the great difference between the two currents which had
derived their initial teaching from the same source.

JUDAISM
The Pharisees

Judaism has been described by Moses Mendelssohn, a
learned Jew, in this way : — " Judaism is not a religion but a
Law religionized. " This definition does away effectively
with the erroneous belief prevalent among the non-Jews that
Judaism is a religion.
In spite of the loud and frequent assertions, made by Jews
and Christian divines alike, contending that the Jews were the
first monotheists, it is a well proven fact that the high initiates
of the Memphis priesthood were monotheists long before the
Jews ever went to Egypt.
Judaism would be best described as a rite or compendium
of rites, for, if one lends belief to the existence of the Jewish
Lawgiver, Moses, one must bear in mind that he first studied
among the high initiates of Egypt, and later, became the pupil
and son-in-law of black Jethro, the Ethiopian magician whom
one might call the Father of Voodooism, name given to the
magic practices and rites performed by the negroes.
The closer one studies the history of the Jews, the clearer it
appears that they are neither a religious entity nor a nation.
The absolute failure of Zionism which
75

76

OCCULT THEOCRASY

was a desperate effort on the part of certain Jewish leaders to
bind all the Jews of the world into a national entity, whose
territory would have been Palestine, proves the futility of
such an effort.
Judaism is not a religion and the Jews are not a nation, but
they are a sect with Judaism as a rite.
The obligations and rules of the rite for the Jewish masses
are contained in the Talmud and Schulchan Aruk, but the
esoteric teachings for the higher initiates are to be found in
the Cabala.
Therein are contained the mysterious rites for evocations,
the indications and keys to practices for conjuration of
supernatural forces, the science of numbers, astrology, etc.
The practical application of the Cabalist knowledge is
manifested in the use made of it, through the ages, by Jews to
gain influence both in the higher spheres of Gentile life and
over the masses. Sovereigns and Popes, both, usually had one
or more Jews as astrologers and advisers, and they frequently
gave Jews control over their very life by employing them as
physicians. Political power was thus gained by Jews in almost
every Gentile country alongside with financial power, since
Jewish court-bankers manipulated state funds and taxes.
Through the ages also, can be followed the spreading
power of the sect, and no more awful example of the
devastating and destructive power of the penetration of a
secret subversive society has ever been witnessed.
With its B'nai B'rith Supreme Council as the directing head,
the sect with its members swarming among all nations has
become the sovereign power ruling in the councils of all
nations and governing their political, economic, religious
and educational policies.
In his book Nicholas II et les Juifs, Netchvolodow

JUDAISM,

THE PHARISEES

77

explains that " the Chaldean science acquired by many of the
Jewish priests, during the captivity of Babylon, gave birth to
the sect of the Pharisees whose name only appears in the Holy
Scriptures and in the writings of the Jewish historians after
the captivity (606 B. C). The works of the celebrated scientist
Munk leave no doubt on the point that the sect appeared
during the period of the captivity.
" From then dates the Cabala or Tradition of the Pharisees.
For a long time their precepts were only transmitted orally but
later they formed the Talmud and received their final form in
the book called the Sepher ha Zohar. " l
The Pharisees were, as it were, a class whose tendency was
to form a kind of intellectual aristocracy among the Jews. At
first, they formed a sort of brotherhood, a haburah, the
members being called haburim or brothers. They were a
subversive element, aiming at the overthrow of the
Sadducean High-priesthood, whose members prided
themselves on their aristocracy of blood and birth, to which
the Pharisees opposed an aristocracy of learning. The war
waged by the latter extends over a long period of time, and
the rivalry was bitter. The Pharisees, who, although they
professed, as one of their chief tenets, the utmost contempt of
the am-haretz or simple people, did not overlook the fact that
they needed their mass support for the attainment of their own
aim, and they enlisted it by opposing the Sadducean strictness
of the Law in many instances, namely, in the observance of
the Sabbath.
The power of the Sadducees fell with the destruction of the
Temple by Titus and thenceforth the Pharisaic element held
supremacy among the Jews.
1. Lt. Gen. A. Netchvolodow, Nicolas II et les Juifs, p. 139.

78

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Quoting an acknowledged authority on Judaism, Mr.
Flavien Brenier, Lt. Gen. Netchvolodow further describes the
policy of the sect as follows : 2
" Before appearing proudly as the expression of Jewish
aspirations, The Tradition of the Pharisees had serious
difficulties to surmount, the chief of which was the revival of
the orthodox faith stimulated in the Jewish people by the
Captivity. To the exiles, bemoaning the fall of the Temple of
Jerusalem and begging Jehovah to end the misfortunes of
their homeland, the revelation that Jehovah was only a
phantom, entailed not only certain defeat, but also their own
exposure to perils the least of which would have been the loss
of all authority over Israel.
" The Pharisees then, judging it wiser to capture the
confidence of their compatriots by taking the lead of the
religious movement, affected a scrupulous observance of the
slightest prescriptions of the law and instituted the practice of
complicated rituals, simultaneously however cultivating the
new doctrine in their secret sanctuaries. These were regular
secret societies, composed during the captivity of a few hundred adepts. At the time of Flavius Josephus which was that of
their greatest prosperity they numbered only some 6,000
members.
" This group of intellectual pantheists was soon to acquire a
directing influence over the Jewish nation. Nothing, moreover,
likely to offend national sentiment ever appeared in their
doctrines. However saturated with pantheistic Chaldeism they
might have been, the Pharisees preserved their ethnic pride
intact. This religion of Man divinised, which they had
absorbed at Babylon, they conceived solely as applying to
the
2. Ibid., p. 139 et seq.

JUDAISM,

79

profit of the Jew, the superior and predestined being. The
promises of universal dominion which the orthodox Jew
found in the Law, the Pharisees did not interpret in the sense
of the reign of the God of Moses over the nations, but in that
of a material domination to be imposed on the universe by the
Jews. The awaited Messiah was no longer the Redeemer of
original Sin, a spiritual victor who would lead the world, it
was a temporal king, bloody with battle, who would make
Israel master of the world and ' drag all peoples under the
wheels of his chariot'. The Pharisees did not ask this
enslavement of the nations of a mystical Jehovah, which they
continued worshipping in public, only as a concession to
popular opinion, for they expected its eventual consummation
to be achieved by the secular patience of Israel and the use of
human means.
" Monstrously different from the ancient law were such
principles as these, but they had nothing one could see, which
might have rendered unpopular those who let them filter, drop
by drop, among the Jews.
" The admirably conceived organization of the Pharisees
did not fail soon to bear fruit.
" One cannot better define its action in the midst of Jewish
society before Jesus Christ, " said Mr. Fla-vien Brenier, " than
in comparing it with that of the Freemasons in modern
society. "
" A carefully restricted membership tightly bound,
imposing on their members the religion of ' the secret', the
Pharisees pursued relentlessly their double aim which was :
—
1. The seizure of political power, by the possession of the
great political offices (the influence of which was tremendous
in the reconstituted Jewish nation) and the conquest of the
Sanhedrin (Jewish parliament).

80

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

" 2. To modify gradually the conceptions of the people in
the direction of their secret doctrine. "
The first of these aims was achieved when Hillel, a
Pharisee of Babylon who claimed Davidic descent, was
elected president of the Sanhedrin. Thus ended the bitter fight
between the Pharisees and the Sad-ducees. Opposed to Hillel
was Shammai, a Sadducee, supporter of the Sadducean High
Priest who was made Chief Judge of the assembly. The
attitude of the two men towards each other is a matter of long
record in the Talmud
Among the most noted Pharisees, after Hillel, are : —
Yochanan ben Zakkai, founder of the school of Yamnai,
Akibah who, with Bar Cochba, fomented the revolt against
the Romans under Hadrian, rebellion ending with the order
for the dispersion of Jews (132 A. D.) Also Simon ben Yohai,
who might be termed the great Magician and Father of the
Cabala, lastly Judah the Prince who compiled the Babylonian
Talmud. Under these chiefs, the Pharisaic power was
definitely established in the Sanhedrin. Those among the Jews
who clung to the Sadducean tradition and refused to
acknowledge the dominion of the Pharisees, remained as
dissidents. Such were the Samaritans and the Karaites who
rejected the Talmud.
The second of the aims and its method of attainment is
exposed in the so-called Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion so
loudly denounced by the descendants of those who devised
The Secret Doctrine in Israel, Israel here meaning the Jews as
a religious community, most of whom remain quite ignorant
of the intricate subversive schemes imputed to them.
The attitude of Jesus Christ to this sect is definitely
expressed in the New Testament (see Luke xi and John viii).

JUDAISM,

Exoteric Judaism, the Jewish religion as practised in the
twentieth century, is based on the Old Testament, and on
equally ancient commentaries on it, preserved for ages as oral
traditions, and known, as above stated, under the general
name of The Talmud. All copies of this book were ordered to
be burned by Philip IV, the Fair, King of France, in 1306, but
the book survived the holocaust.
We know that the Jewish God is not the father of all men
and the ideal of love, justice and mercy, like the Christian
God, or even like Ahura-Mazda or Brahma. On the contrary,
he is the God of vengeance down to the fourth generation, just
and merciful only to his own people, but foe to all other
nations, denying them human rights and commanding their
enslavement that Israel might appropriate their riches and rule
over them.
The following quotations will serve to illustrate this point :
—
" And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before
thee ; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them ; thou
shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them.
" — Deut. vii, 2.
" For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God : the
Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto
himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. "
—Deut. vii, 6.
The Talmud comments upon it : " You are human beings,
but the nations of the world are not human beings but beasts. "
Baba Mecia 114,6.
On the house of the Goy (non-Jew) one looks as on
the fold of cattle. " — Tosefta, Erubin viii.
From The Talmud (a prayer said on the eve of Passover, to
the present day) " We beg Thee, 0 Lord,

82

indict Thy wrath on the nations not believing in Thee, and not
calling on Thy name. Let down Thy wrath on them and inflict
them with Thy wrath. Drive them away in Thy wrath and
crush them into pieces. Take away, O Lord, all bone from
them. In a moment indict all disbelievers. Destroy in a
moment all foes of Thy nation. Draw out with the root,
disperse and ruin unworthy nations. Destroy them ! Destroy
them immediately, in this very moment! " — (Pranajtis ;
Chris-tianus in Talmudas Judeorum, quotations from :
Syna-goga Judaica, p. 212. Minhagin, p. 23. Crach Chaim
480 Hagah).
" When one sees inhabited houses of the ' Goy ' one says, '
The Lord will destroy the house of the proud '. And when one
sees them destroyed he says, ' The Lord God of Vengeance
has revealed himself' — (The Babylonian Talmud, Berachot
58,6.)
" Those who do not own Torah and the prophets must all be
killed. Who has power to kill them, let him kill them openly
with the sword, if not, let him use artifices till they are done
away with. " — (Schul-chan Aruch : Choszen Hamiszpat,
425,50).
The Jewish Sages soon understood that Christ's way of
commenting upon the old Law introduced, instead of hatred
towards foreign nations, brotherly feelings and equality of all
men in the face of God, thus denying the Jews their privileged
position as masters of the world.
At the same time, Christ's reforming the very primitive and
rough moral ideas of the Old Testament, deprived the Jews of
their very convenient-in-the-battle-of-life, unscrupulous,
double morality. Thence the Jewish hatred for the Christian
faith is conspicuous in the following quotations from
Talmudic sources : —

JUDAISM,

" The estates of the Goys are like wilderness, who first settles in
them has a right to them. (Baba Batra, 54 b.)
" The property of the Goys is like a thing without a master. "
(Schulchan Aruch : Choszen Hamiszpat, 156,5).
" If a Jew has struck his spade into the ground of the Goy, he has
become the master of the whole. " (Baba Batra, 55 a.)
In order to enhance the authority of the Old Testament equally
recognized by the Christians, while simultaneously augmenting that
of the Talmud and the Rabbis, its commentators and authors teach :
—
" In the law (the Bible) are things more or less important, but the
words of the Learned in the Scripture are always important.
" It is more wicked to protest the words of the rabbis than of
Torah " (Miszna, Sanhedryn xi, 3.) " Who changes the words of the
rabbis ought to die. " (Erubin, 21, b.)
" The decisions of the Talmud are words of the living God.
Jehovah himself asks the opinion of earthly rabbis when there are
difficult affairs in heaven. " (Rabbi Menachem, Comments for the
Fifth Book.)
" Jehovah himself in heaven studies the Talmud, standing : he has
such respect for that book. " (Tr. Mechilla).
To enhance the dignity of religions dogmas the following
commandments are given :
" That the Jewish nation is the only nation selected by God, while
all the remaining ones are contemptible and hateful.
" That all property of other nations belongs to the Jewish nation,
which consequently is entitled to seize upon it without any scruples.
"
" That an orthodox Jew is not bound to observe principles of
morality towards people of other nations, and on the contrary, he
even ought to act against morality, if it were profitable for himself or
for the interest of Jews in general. "

The Kol Nidre prayer on the Day of Judgment, that acquits
beforehand from the nonfulfilment of all kinds of oaths and
vows, is given here.
" All vows, oaths, promises, engagements, and swearing,

nation, understood the necessity of keeping its contents a
secret and thus legislated :
" To communicate anything to a goy about our religious
relations would be equal to the killing of all the Jews, for if the
goys knew what we teach about them, they would kill us
openly. " (Book ofLibbre David, 37.)
" It is forbidden to disclose the secrets of the Law. He who
would do it would be as guilty as if he destroyed the whole
world " (Jaktu Chadasz, 171,2). The restrictions and
commandments bearing this in view were raised to the dignity
of dogmas of faith. It is not astonishing that in face of such
prohibitions the secrets of the Talmud have been so little
known to other nations, especially to the Western ones, and
till the present day, even the most progressive and citizen-like
Jews think the disclosure of the principles of the Talmud a
proof of the most outrageous intolerance, and an attack on the
Jewish religion.
In order to separate the Jewish nation from all others, and
thus prevent it from mixing with them, and losing their
national peculiarities, a great many precepts of the ritual and
rules for every-day life, prejudices and superstitions, the
remainder of the times of barbarism and obscurity, have been
gathered in the Talmud and consecrated as canons. The
precepts observed by Eastern Jews till the present day deride
even the most simple notions of culture and hygiene. For
instance they enjoin :
" If a Jew be called to explain any part of the rabbinic books,
he only ought to give a false explanation, that he might not, by
behaving differently, become an accomplice in betraying this
information. Who will violate this order shall be put to death.

" A boy-goy after nine years and one day old, and a girl
after three years and one day old, are considered filthy. "
{Pereferkowicz : Talmud t. v., p. 11.)
These principles afford an explanation of the action of
governments in excluding Jews from judicial and military
positions. They also explain that mysterious phenomenon
known as Antisemitism.
In his Manual of Freemasonry Richard Carlile makes the
following observations : 3
" The disposition of the mistaken Jew is to monopolise his
portion of the Sacred Scriptures as a charm or benefit
prepared and presented to his people in their sectarian
character.
" That there was no such nation as the Israelites, is a truth
— found in the consideration that they are not mentioned
beyond the Bible in any records whatever. Egypt knew them
not, Persia knew them not, Hindostan knew them not, Scythia
knew them not, Phoenicia knew them not, Greece knew them
not, as a nation. And in the first general notice that we have of
the Jews, they are introduced to the world as a sect, or a series
of sects, being Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes ; and in that
general notice, beyond that sort of mistaken allegorical
history which Josephus
• Carlile, Manual of Freemasonry, p. 88.

has copied from the books of the Old Testament, and which is
not otherwise corroborated, and no better authority than the
book of the Old Testament, there is no presentation of the
Jews as the descendants of a larger nation of Israelites ; as a
religious or philosophical sect of distinction, mixed up with,
and found in real human history, they are not to be traced
higher than the century before the Christian era. It is satisfactory to be able to show the origin of anything, for such a
knowledge is a common passion and curiosity among
mankind ; and I think the Rev. Robert Taylor has discovered
and developed the origin of the titles of Hebrew, Israelite,
and Jew. 4
" Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew, are Syriac, Phoenician and
Egyptian terms used in the mysterious degrees ; and it would
be as reasonable to argue that the Freemasons are a dispersed
nation, as that the Jews are, or were, a dispersed nation. The
Rev. Mr. Taylor has beautifully explained this in his
discourses. 5
" The scenes and characters of the mysterious drama, as
found in the Eleusinian Orgies of Greece, were : —
Eleusis. — The Advent, or coming-in light —• the birth and
character of the subject of the drama — the title of the whole
play or mystery.
Hierophant. — The Expounder of the Mysteries, the High
Priest, the Pope, the Archbishop.
Hupereet. — The Minister, or Ordinary Priest.
Diaconos. — The Deacon, or Lower Officer.
Diadochos. — The Torch-bearer.

Carlile further states 6 " We are prepared with historical
disproofs of the existence of such a people as Israelites or
Jews as a nation. They were a religious or philosophical sect,
who had been made adepts in the higher Pagan Mysteries : a
sect among nations ; but not a nation among sects. "
Judaism sanctions Gnosticism which is further elaborated
in their books of the Cabala. For further study of this subject
we refer the reader to Chapter XIII.

ORPHEISM AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES

There is no greater or more erudite authority than Fabre
d'Olivet (1768-1825) on Orpheus or Dyonisius l and to such
an eminent source, among many others, must the reader be
referred.
The feats of the white Dorian race of Greece and the
mysticism of its priests of Thrace as well as the centuries-long
rivalry between the solar or male cult and the lunar or female
cult, have provided inexhaustible sources of religious and
literary lore.
The legendary birth of Orpheus adorned with his descent
from Apollo, his flight from Thrace, initiation in the temple of
Memphis and return to his own country as a high adept of the
most profound mysteries, constitute but the first part of his
life.
After his return to Greece, he united the cults of Dyonisius
and Zeus, reformed that of Bacchus and instituted the
Mysteries. To him was allotted the task of reducing the power
of the Bacchantes, priestesses of Hecate, by a magic superior
to theirs, and their vengeance, which caused his death, has
been the theme of many a poet.

One follows the evolution of Greece from Orpheus to
Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato and one searches for the
remnants of Egyptian esoterism in the utmost recesses of the
Delphic temples and in the ceremonies of initiation to the
Eleusinian mysteries. These, having still been practised until
the Emperor Theodosius I, the Great, (379-395) prohibited
them and ordered the destruction of the Eleusinian Temple,
much material is available for their description.
We are indebted to Bishop Lavington, an erudite member
of the Anglican Church, for a graphic description of the
perversion to which they gave rise, but we preface this article
with that author's apology to the reader, which, like the text of
most of this chapter, we quote verbatim from the Bishop's
book The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists compared,
Part III :
" We wallow indeed in the mire, by publishing these things.
But lest any one should fall into the mire of these heretics,
from mere ignorance, I purposely and knowingly defile my
own mouth, and the ears of the auditors, because it is
beneficial. For it is much better to hear absurdity and filthiness
in accusing others, than to fall into them out of ignorance.
Much better to be informed of the mire, than, for want of
information, to fall into it. "
Bishop Lavington then proceeds with the explanation of
the Pagan Mysteries from which we quote : 2 —
" The Gods and Goddesses each had their special mysteries.
Even Cotytto, the Goddess of Turpitude, had her rites and
devotees.
" A high opinion of the Mysteries was very far from being
general, or received by great and good Persons. Those great
Men, Agesilaus and Epaminondas, would

Papists compared, p. 313 etseq.

not submit to an Initiation ............. The Athenians asking
Diogenes to be initiated because such had the Precedency in a
future State ; he replied, ' Ridiculous thing ! that Agesilaus
and Epaminondas must rowl in dirt; and every Scoundrel
initiated, such as Patecion the Thief, be happy in the Elysian
Fields. ' Nor shall we entertain the better Notion of the
Mysteries when we find so wise and good a Man as Socrates
refusing initiation. For which (though perhaps he had stronger)
he gives this Reason : ' If the Mysteries were bad, he should
not be able to conceal the Secret, but must discourage every
one from Initiation; and if good, Humanity would oblige him
to discover it for the public Benefit. '
" Rut whether the Mysteries were good or bad, Authors are
pretty well agreed as to the preparatory Ceremonies, and
manner of Initiation : whereby they were to Represent, and
Act over again, the Actions and passions of the Deities, for
whose Honour the Mysteries were instituted.
" That Initiation might seem a venerable and solemn Thing,
the Devotees were taught to qualify themselves by Prayer to
the Demons, Fastings, Watchings, Confession to the Priest,
and other Lustrations. We read in Plutarch, ' that fasting is to
precede the Mysteries of Ceres, ' and that Confession was
required ; ' Antal-cidas being examined by the Priest, in order
to his initiation, what grievous crimes he had committed,
made Answer, ' If I have been guilty of any such Crime, the
Gods know it already. ' The Confession was a trick of the
Masters of the Ceremonies to get the people under their
Girdle.
" Tertullian says, ' As to the superstition of the Eleusinian
Mysteries, what they conceal is the Shame of them. Therefore
they make the Admission tortuous,

ORPH.EISM AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES

93

take Time in the Initiation, set a Seal on. the Tongue, and
instruct the Epoptae for five Years, to raise a high Opinion of
them by Delay and Expectation. But all the Divinity in the
sacred Domes, the Whole of what they aspire to, what sealeth
the Tongue, is this :
___Simulacrum membri Virilis revelatur. But for a
Cover of their Sacrilege, they pretend these Figures are only a
mystical Representation of venerable Nature. ' " The original
Reason of such figures being exposed to View, and had in
Veneration, in the Mysteries, we learn from others. Clemens
Alexandrinus giveth a full account of this religion of the
Mysteries, too prolix to be transcribed ; — 'Of their wicked
Institution, Cruelty, Stupidity, Madness, making Goddesses
of Harlots, corrupting Mankind : — the Mysteries of Ceres
are nothing but representations of incestuous Deities : — their
ridiculous Exclamations upon Admission were, I have eat out
of the Timbrel, I have drank out of the Cymbal, I have carried
the Chest, I have crept into the secret Chamber. ' In the Chest
Pudendum Bacchi inclusum erat. — Cistam et veretrum nova
Reli-gione colenda tradunt. — It is a shame to mention the
filthy circumstances in the story of Ceres...
" The Pagan Mysteries being of such an immoral Nature,
and Tendency, it might justly be thought strange, were no
Notice taken of them in the Holy Scriptures. And therefore,
though such an Enquiry might carry us into too great a Length,
yet I shall not entirely pass it over. There can be then little
Doubt, but they are pointed out by St. Paul : ' It is a Shame
even to speak of those Things that are done of them in Secret.
' And where Christianity is termed the Mystery of Godliness,
it is set, I am persuaded, in Opposition, not only to the
Mystery of Iniquity that was to work in the Christian World,
but likewise to the

94

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

preceding Mysteries among the Gentiles. Nor is it improbable,
that the Apostle writeth in direct Opposition to the
Appearances, Pretences, and Impostures of those false
Divinities : Without Controversy great is the Mystery of
Godliness...
" In the Old Testament, Deut. xxiii. 17 (not indeed in the
Hebrew, but in the Septuagint) after the Words, ' There shall
be no Whore, — nor Sodomites of the Sons of Israel, ' we find
added Words of this Import, ' There shall not be an Initiator,
nor an Initiated, of the Sons or Daughters of Israel. ' ' Tis
possible this additional Clause may have been inserted by the
Seventy, by Way of Interpretation of the preceding Words.
They knew the Nature of the Mysteries full well; and we are
led to this Meaning by the Impurities forbidden, and by the
Price of the Dog in the next Verse ; the Egyptian God Anubis
being usually figured with a Dog's Head. (Edit. Daniel.
Schol.)
" We may observe also, that Philo the Jew (de Sacriflc.)
expressly ranketh the Prohibition of the Mysteries among the
Laws of Moses. ' The Law, saith he, expressly excludeth the
whole of the Mysteries, their Inchantments and execrable
Scurrilities, from the Holy Ordinances : not permitting those
educated in her Society to celebrate such Heathen Rites; nor,
depending on such mystical Ceremonies, to disregard the
Truth ; and to follow the Works of Night and Darkness,
omitting what deserveth the Light and the Day. Let none
therefore among the Disciples of Moses either initiate, or be
initiated : it being equally wicked either to teach, or to learn
the Mysteries. — ' Tis generally the Case with them, that no
good Person is initiated ; but Thieves, and Pirates, and mad
Gangs of abominable and immodest women; after parting
with their Money to the initiating Priests. "

ORPHEISM AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES

95

Several of the Fathers have taken Notice of the same Passage
in the Septuagint, and explained it in the same manner.
" For further Proof of the Turpitude in the Mysteries of Isis
and Osiris, and that it was so from the Beginning, we need
only consult Diodorus Siculus, Lib. I. ' Isis being
overwhelmed with Grief for the Loss of her Husband Osiris,
took particular Care in deifying him to consecrate his
Pudenda ; which she ordered to be peculiarly honoured and
adored in the Mysteries. And the same holy Institution was
observed with the same Ceremonies, when carried into
Greece by Orpheus : where the common People, partly from
Ignorance, and partly from a Love of the new god (Phallus),
were very fond of being initiated. '
" Much more might be collected (even from initiated
Authors, however, generally shy) concerning the infamous
Origin of the Mysteries, which I pass over.....
" The celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries commenced
in Greece about 1400 years before Christ but ' whenever or
however they were brought into Greece, and transferred to the
Honour of Ceres and Proserpina, they were of the same
Nature, and observed with equally chaste Ceremonies, with
those of Isis... '
" One contrivance for ' giving the Initiated a Sight of the
Divinities, was by means of a Looking-glass, wherein none
could see their own Faces, but had a clear View of the Gods
and Goddesses. ' This we have from Pausanias : and Eusebius
relates the same Thing. - So easily might weak People, and
under the utmost Astonishment, be deluded by Figures
behind a glass, in a proper Habit and Posture ; and especially
by living Persons, personating the Deities in any Manner they
thought fit.
' As a proof of the Indecencies, Sozomen writeth,

96

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

' that Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, egregiously ridiculed
and exposed to public View the shameful Figures belonging
to the Mysteries, the Phallus, etc. which he brought out of the
Pagan Temple. For which the enraged Heathens raised a
Tumult, and massacred a great Number of the Christians. ' —
Even the initiated Pausanias (notwithstanding his usual
Reservedness) sometimes blurts out a little too much, and
intimates something
shameful — :
' as
frequent
assignations ;
— the proneness of the religious Females to venery
— a Mixture of the Obscene and Miraculous ; — the
continuance of the Eleusinian Festival for a week ; on the
third Day whereof all Males, even the Dogs, are excluded ;
but the next Day the Men are admitted among them, when
they pass the Time in sporting, and light Discourse ; — the
Amours of Ceres, of a very strange Kind ; with the Secrecy
enjoined ; — The Obscenities in the Mysteries of Cupid, and
suitable Hymns. '
" A man initiated, and under an Oath of Silence, could not
well have discovered more of the true Nature of the Mysteries,
and the Reason why they ought not to be divulged. We are
assured too, that one Day of the Eleusinian Festival was set
apart for the Rites of Venus and Cupid, and another for those
of Bacchus : both of which were confessedly beyond measure
abominable. Nor will our Opinion be more favourable, when
we remember what Athenceus writes ; ' Apelles, being
extremely desirous of drawing a Venus from the famous
Phryne, could find no Opportunity of seeing her naked,
without going to the Eleusinian and Neptunian Games ; where
she stripped herself in the Sight of all the Men, and went into
the sea to wash herself..'
" I apprehend therefore that no great Stress is to be laid
upon those initiated Authors, who have thought

ORPHEISM AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES

97

themselves obliged to say nothing but what was good of the
Mysteries ; or have talked of the Unity of the Deity, as the
great Secret of them; perhaps to avoid the Shame of being
thought Dupes to a foolery, or inquisitive into something
worse. " 3
On the same subject the Chevalier de Ramsay, reputed
founder of Scottish Rites, writes the following : 4 —
" About the fifteenth Olympiad, six hundred Years before
the Christian aera, the Greeks having lost the traditional
Knowledge of the Orientals, began to lay aside the Doctrine
of the Ancients, and to reason about the Divine Nature from
Prejudices which their Senses and Imagination suggested.
Anaximander lived at that time, and was the first that set
himself to destroy the Belief of a supreme Intelligence, in
order to account for everything from the Action of blind
Matter, which by necessity assumes all Sorts of Forms. He
was followed by Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Strato,
Lucretius, and all the School of the Atomical Philosophers.
" Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and
all the great Men of Greece, opposed this impious Doctrine,
and endeavoured to prove the ancient Theology of the
Orientals. These Philosophers of a superior Genius observed
in Nature, Motion, Thought and Design. And as the Idea of
Matter includes none of these three Properties, they inferred
from thence, that there was another Substance different from
Matter.
" Greece being thus divided into two Sects, they disputed
for a long time, without either Party being

convinced. At length about the 120th Olympiad Pyrrho
formed a third Sect whose great Principle was to doubt
everything, and determine nothing. All the Atomists who had
laboured in vain to find out a Demonstration of their false
Principles, presently struck in with the Pyrrhonian Sect. They
ran wildly into the System of an universal Doubt, and carried
it almost to such an Excess of Frenzy, that they doubted of the
clearest and most sensible Truths. They maintained without
any Allegory, that everything we see is only an Illusion, and
that the whole Series of Life is but a perpetual Dream of
which those of the Night are only so many Images.
" At last Zeno set up a fourth School about the 130th
Olympiad. This Philosopher endeavoured to reconcile the
Disciples of Democritus with those of Plato, by maintaining
that the first Principle was indeed an infinite Wisdom, but his
Essence was only a pure Aether, or a subtile Light, which
diffused itself everywhere, to give Life, Motion,' and Reason
to all Beings.
" In these last Ages the modern Freethinkers have done
nothing but revive the ancient Errors. Jordano Bruno, Vannini
and Spinoza, have vamped up the monstrous System of
Anaximander; and the last of the three has endeavoured to
dazzle weak Minds, by dressing it up in a geometrical Form.
" Some Spinosists, finding that they were every Moment at
a Loss for Evidence in the pretended Demonstrations of their
Master, are fallen into a senseless sort of Scepticism, called
Egomism, where every one fancies himself to be the only
Being that exists.
" Mr. Hobbes and several other Philosophers, without
setting up for Atheists, have ventured to maintain, that
Thought and Extension are Properties of the same Substance.

ORPHEISM AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES

99

" Descartes, F. Malebranche, Leibnitz, Dr. Bentley,
Clarke, and several Philosophers of a Genius equally
Mile and profound, have endeavoured to refute
these Errors, and brought Arguments to support the
ancient Theology. Besides the Proofs which are drawn
from the Effects, they have insisted on others drawn from the
Idea of the first Cause. They shew plainly that the Reasons of
believing, are infinitely stronger than any Arguments there
are for doubting. This is all that can be expected in
metaphysical Discussions.
"The History of former times is like that of our own
Human Understanding takes almost the same Forms in
different Ages, and loses its Way in the same Labyrinths. "

THE DRUIDS

We heard, in 1928, of a " Druid " celebration at Stonehenge.
Shortly afterwards we read of another, an initiation ceremony,
at Penzance where "12 bards of Britain, including Sir Arthur
Quiller-Couch, the author, were initiated by the Archdruid of
Wales into a sect revived after a lapse of 2000 years. " l
Some of us might prefer the lapse to have continued and as
the subject of the Druid Mysteries is here relevant we quote
verbatim the chapter entitled " The Druids " from Mr. Charles
William Heckethorn's interesting book Secret Societies of All
Ages and Countries :
" The secret doctrines of the Druids were much the same as
those of the Gymnosophists and Brahmins of India, the Magi
of Persia, the priests of Egypt, and of all other priests of
antiquity. Like them, they had two sets of religious doctrines,
exoteric and esoteric. Their rites were practised in Britain and
Gaul, though they were brought to a much greater perfection
in the former country, where the Isle of Anglesey was
considered their chief seat. The word Druid is generally
supposed to be derived from < ; " an oak ", which tree was
1. The Daily Telegraph, Sept. 24, 1928.
100

THE

DRUIDS

101

particularly sacred among them, though its etymology may
also be found in the Gaelic word Druidh, ' a wise man ' or '
magician. '
" Their temples, wherein the sacred fire was preserved,
were generally situate on eminences and in dense groves of
oaks, and assumed various forms.
" The adytum or ark of the mysteries was called a cromlech,
and was used as the sacred pastos2, or place of regeneration. It
consisted of three upright stones, as supporters of a broad, flat
stone laid across them on the top, so as to form a small cell.
Kit Cotey's House, in Kent, was such a pastos. Considerable
space, however, was necessary for the machinery of initiation
in its largest and most comprehensive scale. Therefore, the
Coer Sidi, where the mysteries of Druidism were performed,
consisted of a range of buildings, adjoining the temple,
containing apartments of all sizes, cells, vaults, baths, and
long and artfully-contrived passages, with all the apparatus of
terror used on these occasions. Most frequently these places
were subterranean.
" The system of Druidism embraced every religious and
philosophical pursuit then known in these islands. The rites
bore an undoubted reference to astronomical facts. Their
chief deities are reducible to two, — a male and a female, the
great father and mother, Hu and Ceridwen, distinguished by
the same characteristics as belonged to Osiris and Isis,
Bacchus and Ceres, or any other supreme god and goddess
representing the two principles of all being. The grand
periods of initiation were quarterly, and determined by the
course of the sun, and his arrival at the equinoctial and solstitial points. But the time of annual celebration was
2. Pastos — The altar upon which the ritual desecration of
virginity obligatory for initiation into the phallic cult took place.

OCCULT THEOCRASY

May-eve, when fires were kindled on all the cairns and
cromlechs throughout the island, which burned all night to
introduce the sports of May-day, whence all the national
sports formerly or still practised, date their origin. Round
these fires choral dances were performed in honour of the sun,
who, at this season, was figuratively said to rise from his
tomb. The festival was licentious, and continued till the
luminary had attained his meridian height, when priests and
attendants retired to the woods, where the most disgraceful
orgies were perpetrated. But the solemn initiations were
performed at midnight, and contained three degrees, the first
or lowest being the Eubates, the second the Bards, and the
third the Druids. The candidate was first placed in the pastos
bed, or coffin, where his symbolical death represented the
death of Hu, or the sun ; and his restoration in the third degree
symbolized the resurrection of the sun. He had to undergo
trials and tests of courage similar to those practised in the
mysteries of other countries, and which therefore need not be
detailed here.
" The Druids taught the doctrine of one supreme being, a
future state of rewards and punishments, the immortality of
the soul and a metempsychosis... Their doctrines were chiefly
those of Pythagoras.
" Their authority in many cases exceeded that of the
monarch. They were, of course, the sole interpreters of
religion, and consequently superintended all sacrifices; for no
private person was allowed to offer a sacrifice without their
sanction. They possessed the power of excommunication,
which was the most horrible punishment that could be
inflicted next to that of death, and from the effects of which
the highest magistrate was not exempt. The great council of
the realm was not competent to declare war or conclude

THE

DRUIDS

103

peace without their concurrence. They determined all
disputes by a final and unalterable decision, and had the
power of inflicting the punishment of death. And, indeed,
their altars streamed with the blood of human victims.
Holocausts of men, women, and children, enclosed in large
towers of wicker-work, were sometimes sacrificed as a
burnt-offering to their superstitions, which were, at the same
time, intended to enhance the consideration of the priests,
who were an ambitious race delighting in blood. The Druids,
it is said, preferred such as had been guilty of theft, robbery,
or other crimes, as most acceptable to their gods; but when
there was a scarcity of criminals, they made no scruple to
supply their place with innocent persons. These dreadful
sacrifices were offered by the Druids, for the public, on the
eve of a dangerous war, or in the time of any national
calamity ; and also for particular persons of high rank, when
they were afflicted with any dangerous disease.
" The priestesses, clothed in white, and wearing a metal
girdle, foretold the future from the observation of natural
phenomena, but more especially from human sacrifices. For
them was reserved the frightful task of putting to death the
prisoners taken in war, and individuals condemned by the
Druids ; and their auguries were drawn from the manner in
which the blood issued from the many wounds inflicted, and
also from the smoking entrails. Many of these priestesses
maintained a perpetual virginity, others gave themselves up
to the most luxurious excesses.
" As the Romans gained ground in these islands the power
of the Druids gradually declined ; and they were finally
assailed by Suetonius Paulinus, governor of Britain under
Nero, A. D. 61, in their stronghold, the Isle of Anglesey, and
entirely defeated, the conqueror

consuming many of them in the fires which they had kindled
for burning the Roman prisoners they had expected to make
— a very just retaliation upon these sanguinary priests. But
though their dominion was thus destroyed, many of their
religious practices continued much longer; and so late as the
eleventh century, in the reign of Canute, it was necessary to
forbid the people to worship the sun, moon, fires, etc.
Certainly many of the practices of the Druids are still adhered
to in Freemasonry ; and some writers on this order endeavour
to show that it was established soon after the edict of Canute,
and that as thereby the Druidical worship was prohibited in
toto, the strongest oaths were required to bind the initiated to
secrecy. "
There is no mystery as to the existence in Berlin of the "
Druidenorden " today. It is a branch of Freemasonry and its
Sovereign Grand Master, until late, was Dr.
Hubbe-Schleiden.

CHAPTER

X

CHRISTIANITY

To define Christianity, one could hardly do better than use
the words of Frederic W. Farrar, Canon of Westminster and
Chaplain to Queen Victoria, who in 1874 wrote a Life of
Christ. In his preface are the following lines :
" We study the sacred books of all the great religions of the
world ; we see the effect exercised by those religions on the
mind of their votaries ; and in spite of all the truths which even
the worst of them enshrined, we watch the failure of them all
to produce the inestimable blessings which we have ourselves
enjoyed from infancy, which we treasure as dearly as our life,
and which we regard as solely due to the spread and
establishment of the Christian faith. We read the systems and
treatises of ancient philosophy, and in spite of all the great and
noble elements in which they abound, we see their total
incapacity to console, or support, or deliver, or regenerate the
world. Then we see the light of Christianity dawning like a
tender spring day amid the universal and intolerable darkness.
From the first, that new religion allies itself with the world's
utter feeblenesses, and those feeblenesses it shares; yet
without wealth, without learning, without genius,
105

106

OCCULT THEOCRASY

without arms, without anything to dazzle and attract the
religion 'of outcasts and exiles, of fugitives and prisoners —
numbering among its earliest converts not many wise, not
many noble, not many mighty, but such as the gaoler of
Philippi, and the runaway slave of Colossae — with no
blessing apparently upon it save such as cometh from above
— with no light whatever about it save the light that comes
from heaven — it puts to flight kings and their armies ; it
breathes a new life, and a new hope, and a new and unknown
holiness into a guilty and decrepit world. This we see ; and we
see the work grow, and increase, and become more and more
irresistible, and spread ' with the gentleness of a sea that
caresses the shore it covers. ' "
Words fail when attempting to speak of Jesus Christ, the
Founder of Christianity. His birth, life and death are known to
all. His teaching was public and accessible to the humblest.
Long years of learning, awful initiation ceremonies striking
terror in the adept's soul were not required from the followers
of Christ. Himself, the bearer of that Light which He taught
was not to be found in man's earthly nature but was to be
sought from without, He invoked God with humble prayer
and faith, and performed all miracles.
Therein, is Christ's teaching diametrically opposed to that
of the high adepts whose secret doctrine was that man had
divinity in himself and could bring it out by exercise of will,
by concentration of thought and scientific psychic
development. Fear, the predominant feature attendant upon
the gaining of knowledge in all other religious systems, was
foreign to the adherents of Christ who were repeatedly told : '
Fear not'... " Be not afraid '. No bonds, no fetters were
imposed by Him in the shape of ritualism. Love of

CHRISTIANITY

107

God and love of neighbour were the only precepts, Faith and
Charity the only means through which the divine Spirit gave
man transcendental power over moral evil and physical ills.
No purer and simpler doctrine, no greater knowledge of the
communion possible between God and man had ever been
given. Yet, within a very short time after the death of Christ,
Christian ritualism began to appear. A theological system of
dogmas and beliefs was devised, modes of worship
elaborated and a hierarchy arose with all its attendant evils.
However, the Christian faith, under the lash of persecution,
had shown the world the power of Faith and Charity.
And against this power the forces of evil have ever been
unfurled. Blow after blow was dealt to the rising church.
Both its beliefs and practices were attacked by those who
professed other views and worshipped other gods and who
designed all schemes to subvert and pervert Christianity.
Henceforth, as it has ever been with all religions, the history
of Christianity and of Gnosticism will develop side by side,
the perversion and destruction of the former being the aims of
the latter.
The Tree of Christianity gave forth three main branches,
the Catholicism of Rome, Greek Catholicism, and in the XVI
Century, Lutherism. The two former bodies remained
homogeneous but Lutherism gave birth to innumerable sects
all dissenting from the parent church.

MANICHEISM

Manicheism is the religion of the followers of Manes, a
slave who was sold to a widow who freed and adopted him,
thus making him the " son of the widow " a name which after
him passed to all his followers and is still used in Masonic
Lodges.
Of Manicheism, C. W. Olliver, considered an authority on
all masonic matters, writes :
" Manicheism was one of the most important attempts to
found a universal religion and to reconcile the Christian,
Buddhist, and Mazdean with the Greek philosophy. It
presented the same syncretic ideas found later among Moslem
Druzes and among Sikhs. It failed in the first place because
Islam presented a much simpler system in the East, and
because in the West Christianity was already developing, in
the time of Manes, a religion which aimed at reconciling the
Paganism of Italy and Gaul with the ethics of Christ, this
presenting a simpler and more familiar faith. But the one
achievement of Manes was the creation of the Devil which led
to an afterwards unremovable taint throughout religion.
Manes was a notable philosopher and religious teacher born
about the year A. D. 216, and he was crucified and flayed
alive by the Persian
108

Magi under Bahram I in the year A. D. 277. His Persian name
was Shuraik, rendered Cubricus in Latin. " 1
He was the slave of the wife of a certain Terebinth who
was a disciple of Scythianus of the race of the Sarrasins.
Olliver tells us further that : " His Acta Archdei became the
Manichean Bible with sundry added epistles. He taught the
Mazdean dualism of the powers of light and darkness, as
representing good and evil beings, and an asceticism which
aimed at the control of all passions. Manes repudiated
Judaism, and like the Gnostics, regarded Jehovah as an evil
God. The Mani-cheans were more hated and feared by
Catholic Christians than any other sect. They were still in
existence in spite of constant persecution as late as our tenth
century, and their influence was felt from China to Spain and
Gaul. It still lingers in Asia, and among the ' Christians of St.
Thomas ' in Madras it survived till the fifteenth century. St.
Augustine had listened for nine years to Manes, but the
Roman Empire felt the force of this system chiefly in A. D.
280. The Romans knew it themselves in A. D. 330, and
Faustus became its missionary among them. Many clung to
Manicheism till A. D. 440, when Leo the Great found that he
must stamp it out if the Roman creed was not to be extinguished. It was the basis of the Paulican heresy, and of that of
the Albigenses in the South of France which was only
quenched by blood in the thirteenth century.
" The doctrine of Manes can be summed up as follows. He
believed in two gods, or, more exactly, principles, the
principle of good and that of evil. Before the creation of the
world the ' people of darkness ' revolted against the God, and
God, incapable of with1. C. W. Olliver, An Analysis of Magic and Witchcraft, p. 102.

standing the attack, gave to them a portion of His essence.
The people of darkness having within them the principle of
evil by their very nature, and the principle of good which they
had just acquired, were able to constitute the world, where
both these principles are combined, but where the principle of
evil predominates as the natural characteristic of its
originators. Man is a mixture of two natures, the spiritual
being the work of God, the body, and especially sex, the work
of the Devil. " 2
Summers, another authority, further explains that " it must
be clearly borne in mind that these heretical bodies with their
endless ramifications were not merely exponents of erroneous
religious and intellectual beliefs by which they morally
corrupted all who came under their influence, but they were
the avowed enemies of law and order, red-hot anarchists who
would stop at nothing to gain their ends. Terrorism and secret
murder were their most frequent weapons.... The Manichean
system was in truth a simultaneous attack upon the Church
and the State, a desperate but well-planned organization to
destroy the whole fabric of society, to reduce civilization to
chaos. " 3
Manicheism possessed its- dogmas, liturgies, devotees,
and churches.
But again to quote Olliver : " First and foremost amongst
the manifestations of what had become Devil worship we find
the Black Mass or Devil Masses of the Middle Ages, from
which the ceremonial and ritual of Black Magic are derived.
The principle which forms the very essence of the Devil, the
idea of opposition, also underlies the whole ceremonial
and ritual of
2. C. W. Olliver, op. cit, p. 103.
3. M. Summers, History of Witchcraft andDemonology, p. 17.

MANICHEISM

Black Magic and Black Masses. Such ideas as repeating
prayers backwards, reversing the cross, consecrating obscene
or filthy objects, are typical of this sense of opposition or
desecration, which is also a recognised form of mental
disease. The key-word to the whole of the practices of Black
Magic is desecration. "4
Yet another authority not to be overlooked, namely Abbe
Baruel, author of Memoires pour servir a I'his-toire du
Jacobinisms shows the remarkable analogy between the
dogmas and rituals of Freemasonry, Tem-plarism and those of
Manicheism. Grades concur in number and signs are identical.
The mourning for 'Jacques Molay is a ceremony analogous to
that practised by the Manicheans in remembrance of Manes
and known as Bema. The term MacBenac still used in
Masonic lodges was the reminder of the execution of Manes
which all Manichean adepts sought to avenge. The practice of
so called Fraternity or Brotherhood was in Manicheism
extended only to adepts of the sect, just as it is similarly
practised by Freemasons towards one another only.
The question which naturally comes up to one's mind when
one follows closely the links of the Manichean chain is this :
— Is not Freemasonry, such as we see it to-day, the full
development of the idea of Cubricus or Manes the slave, the
apotheosis of Manicheism as achieved by Albert Pike,
Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry ?

WITCHCRAFT

Margaret Alice Murray, writing in The Witch-cult in Western
Europe establishes both the phallic and religious character of the "
craft ", in her remarkable book from which we extract part of the
following valuable information :
The deity worshipped by the witches was in some cases Lucifer,
as the Good God in opposition to Adonay, the Christian God in His
character of the benefactor of humanity, and in other instances
Satan, the same spirit, as the Principle of Evil.
This is evident from the various references to their deity adduced
in the trials of persons accused of this heresy. In both cases however,
the devotees, whether of Lucifer or Satan, were obliged formally to
renounce Christ, the Holy Ghost and the Christian God, before
embracing the Devil faith which was the logical outgrowth of the
Mazdean-Manichean Dualist doctrine of the double divinity. ;
1. " Epiphanius gives an account of a sect of Heretics called
Satanians. ' Satan, say they, is a very great and potent Person, and
author of much Mischief. Why, therefore, should we not chiefly fly
to him, and adore him, honour, and praise trim, that for our flattering
worship he may do us no harm, but
112

WITCHCRAFT

113

The God of the witches seems to have been generally
represented either as the double faced God Janus or the
goat-headed Baphomet, the latter variously modified but
usually bearing between the horns on its head the phallic
emblem of a lighted candle.
Esoterically, this candle symbolized the sex-force or
Kundalini risen to the pineal gland.
Cotton Mather stated that the witches " form themselves
after the manner of Congregational Churches, " and M. A.
Murray gives the following description of their leader :
" The Chief or supreme Head of each district was known to
the recorders as the ' Devil '. Below him in each district, one
or more officers — according to the size of the district —
were appointed by the chief. The officers might be either men
or women; their duties were to arrange for meetings, to send
out notices, to keep the record of work done, to transact the
business of the community, and to present new members.
Evidently these persons also noted any likely convert, and
either themselves entered into negotiations or reported to the
Chief, who then took action as opportunity served. At the
Esbats the officer appears to have taken command in the
absence of the Grand Master ; at the Sabbaths the officers
were merely heads of their own Covens, and were known as
Devils or Spirits, though recognized as greatly inferior to the
Chief. The principal officer acted as clerk at the Sabbath and
entered the witches' report in his book ; if he were a priest or
ordained minister, he often performed part of the religious
service ; but the Devil
Pardon us as being his own servants ? ' Hence they call themselves Satanians. " Bishop Lavington, The Moravians Corn-Pared
and Detected, p. 170.

himself always celebrated the mass or sacrament. "
From Lemoine in La Tradition, published 1892, we learn
that the garter is the distinctive mark of the witch leader, for a
woman shared this honour with the Grand Master as the
Grand Mistress and in some cases occupied the office of
deacon.
Animal masks seem to have been a popular form of
disguise adopted by the witches and wizards attending
meetings, and this custom is probably responsible for many
of the stories of witch lycanthropy.
Among other obscene and phallic witch-rites was the
Black Mass, celebrated by a renegade priest upon the naked
body of the adept for whose benefit it was performed. It
symbolized the perversion of all the rites of the Catholic
church. Black candles instead of white, inverted crosses,
chalices containing the blood of new-born infants sacrificed
for ritual purposes, urine for holy water, all these were part of
the paraphernalia needed, according to historians, to propitiate the Prince of Darkness and his retinue of minor Devils.
Besides evocations, casting of spells and sex-orgies, devil
worship entailed such inanities as desecration of the hosts
stolen from catholic churches and the kissing of the Grand
Master (devil) on the tail or membrum virile.
Only hosts consecrated in Roman Catholic churches could
serve for Black Mass purposes as it was essential, in order to
achieve desecration, that the miracle of transubstantiation
should have taken place. The host had actually to be, not
merely to represent, the body and blood of Christ.
As regards the Black Mass, M. Emile Caillet makes
2. Margaret Alice Murray, The Witch-cult in Western Europe,

WITCHCRAFT

the following astute observation in La Prohibition de
L'Occulte, page 113.
" One may wonder if it was not in order to canalize such an
overflow of sacrilege that the church, in the Middle Ages,
tolerated the ' Feast of Fools ', a last vestige of the saturnalia
of Ancient Greece. Before the altar, upon the
communiontable, writes C. Lenient,3 were spread pell mell,
grilled hogs puddings, sausages, playing cards and dice. For
perfumes, old shoe-leather burned in the incense burners.
Even the text of the divine service... becomes the butt of an
interminable parody..., a confused jumble of jests and
nonsense, of grotesque alleluias and latin buffooneries.... an
indescribable charivari of cat calls, cries and whistles, etc. A
few days afterwards the church, purged of all these impurities,
washed and cleaned, resumed its usual appearance ; God
again became master of His Altar ; the flood of human folly
had passed ! "
In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued a bull against the craft
couched in the following terms :
" It has come to our ears that numbers of both sexes do not
avoid to have intercourse with demons, Incubi and Succubi;
and that by their sorceries, and by their incantations, charms
and conjurations, they suffocate, extinguish, and cause to
perish the births of women, the increase of animals, the corn
of the ground, the grapes of the vineyard and the fruit of the
trees, as well as men, women, flocks, herds, and other various
kinds of animals, vines and apple trees, grass, corn and other
fruits of the earth ; making and procuring that men and
women, flocks and herds and other animals shall suffer and
be tormented both from within and without, so that men beget
not, nor women conceive ;

and they impede the conjugal action of men and women. "
Eliphas Levi, in Histoire de la Magie, (p. 116) gives the
following explanation of the supposed origin of " elementals "
known by spiritists as " dwellers on the threshold. "
He states that; " according to the best authorities, these
spirits (larves) possess an ethereal body formed of the vapour
of blood. That is why they seek blood and why they were
supposed, formerly, to feed on the smoke of sacrifices.
" They are the Incubi and Succubi, the monstrous children
of impure dreams.
" When sufficiently condensed to be visible, they are only a
vapour coloured by the reflection of a picture and, having no
independent life, they imitate the life of him who evokes
them as the shadow does the body.
" They generally manifest around the persons of idiots and
beings devoid of morality whose isolation has led them to
develop irregular habits.
" Owing to the feeble cohesion of the parts of their fantastic
bodies, they fear the open air, fire, and above all, the point of
swords, and as they live only by the life of those who have
created or evoked them, they become the vaporous
appendices of the real body of their parents. So it can happen
that an injury inflicted on them might actually react upon the
parent body, as the unborn child is really wounded or
disfigured by an impression made upon its mother.
" These elementals draw the vital heat from persons in
good health and quickly exhaust those who are weak.
" They are the source of the stories of vampires, stories
only too true and periodically recurrent, as everyone knows.

WITCHCRAFT

117

" That is why one feels a chill of the atmosphere when
approaching mediums who are persons obsessed by these
spirits that never manifest in the presence of anyone able to
unveil the mystery of their monstrous birth. They are children
of an exalted imagination or unbalanced mentality... "
In politics, throughout the ages, witchcraft, as practised by
subversive sects, has played a prominent part.
Illustrations of this are to be found in the case of the North
Berwick Witches who were tried for treason in 1592 when
their Devil or Grand Master, Francis Stewart, Earl of
Bothwell, attempted to supplant James VI as King of
Scotland. The Black Masses held by the infamous Abbe
Guibourg for Madame de Mon-tespan, with the object of
regaining for her the favour of Louis XIV, are famous in
history.
Eliphas Levi, the great initiate, has thus defined the aims of
magic and witchcraft :
" To deceive the peoples for the purpose of exploiting them,
to enslave them and delay their progress, or prevent it even if
possible, such is the crime of black
ii 4

magic.
Proof of the foregoing devil worship and contact with
spirits or devils is found in history, even as late as 1819 when
we read that; " The Devil met Margaret Nin-Gilbert etc... "
Studying the history of the Mopses in 1761 we find its Grand
Masters, Grand Mistresses and Deacons, adorned with the
distinctive " Garter " of the witch, performing the ceremonial
of kissing the Devil's tail as part of the ritual of 18th Century
Masonry. The "Coven" of the Middle Ages is the Masonic '
Lodge " of today, but the " Craft " remains the " Craft ".

THE GNOSTICS
(The Heretics)

Gnosticism, like the Ancient Mysteries, was founded on
Spiritism, their mediums giving instructions purporting to
come from the Gods or Spirits.
In the Christian era, one of the earliest prominent Gnostics
was Simon Magus, a Jew and an adept of the sect of
Dosithians.
This article is composed of certain passages transcribed
verbatim from The Moravians Compared and Detected by
Lavington. (See pages XIII, 59, 105 to 109 and 133).
Among the successive disciples of Simon Magus were —
Basilides, Valentinius, Carpocrates, Marcus, Marcion, Cerdo,
Epiphanes, Montanus, etc., and according to Bishop
Lavington, " these were Heretics, and, that they were Heretics
of the worst Kind that ever defiled and disgraced the Christian
Name, is allowed by all Denominations of Christians.
" Some of these lived in the first Century and even in the
Apostles' Days, but the second Century was most fruitful in
the Production of this Generation of Vipers and we must
receive our Knowledge of their abominable Tenets from the
early Ecclesiastical writers
118

THE

GNOSTICS

119

such as Irenoeus... Epiphanius... Theodoret... and many
others...
" The Spirit among these Heretics went by different Names,
Ogdoas, Sophia, Terra, Jerusalem and Lord in the masculine
Gender : — Is particularly called both Prunicus and Prunica ;
Mother Prunica the bold, and Mother Achamoth : — Their
Mother is a Woman from a Woman. Sometimes their
celestial Beings are neither Male nor Female : sometimes
interchangeably either male or female.
" Such was the Excellency of their Knowledge and
Illumination, who arrogantly styled themselves Gnostics, that
they are superior to Peter or Paul or any of Christ's other
disciples. They only, have drunk up the supreme Knowledge,
are above Principalities and Powers, secure of Salvation : and
for that very Reason are free to debauch Women, or indulge
all manner of Licentiousness — This Knowledge is of itself
perfect Redemption, and sufficient. " — " Simon Magus, who
taught that his Harlot Helena was the Holy Ghost, instituted
certain foul and infamous Mysteries inexpressibly filthy and
had Assemblies equally filthy to celebrate them : These being
the Mysteries of Life, and of the most perfect Knowledge. "
" The Carpocratians... practised all manner of Philtres and
Enchantments : in order, as they speak, to have full Power in
all Things, and to do whatever they please. — Hence they
spend their Time in Luxury and Pleasure and bodily
Enjoyments : nor ever come among us, unless it be to ensnare
unstable Souls, and entice them into their impious Doctrine.
"
" For this end they taught Incontinence to be obligatory, as
a Law : and not only lawful, but necessary to Salvation ; not
only compatible with the Saviour's Religion, but an essential
Part of it : and those were

120

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the best Men, who in the common Opinion were the most
vicious.
" The Carpocratians grew to that Degree of Madness, that
being unable to conceal their Debaucheries, they made
Incontinence to be a Law " — " Prodicus added this to the
Tenets of Carpocrates, that Fornication ought to be open and
public, and the Use of Women common. For which Reason,
in their Feasts, the Candles were extinguished, each lay with
the Women, as Chance appointed; and they called this
Lasciviousness a mystical
Initiation,
a
mystical
Communion. "
" Clemens Alex, gives a long Passage from the Writings of
Epiphanes, contending for a Community of Women, as being
the Law of Heaven; and that Men and Women ought no more
to be confined in their Amours than other Animals. ' For ',
says Epiphanes, ' he hath implanted a strong and vehement
Desire in Man of propagating his Species ; which neither Law,
nor Custom, nor any Thing else, can abolish ; forjt is the
Decree of God. '
" The Ophites, or Cainites, say, that Cain was the Progeny
of a higher Principality than Abel; and they confess that Esau,
Corah, and the Sodomites, and all such, were their Relations :
— That Vulva was the Creator of the Universe ; and that none
could be saved, unless he passed thro' all. So also Carpocrates
taught. — Most of the Gnostics, with wonderful Artifice of
Improbity, taught what is not fit to be named, in the promiscuous Use of Women, and to roll in all manner of filthy
Communication. The Banquet being over, says the Man to the
Woman, Arise, and shew thy Love to a Brother. So they
proceed to Copulation ". — " Some of them, by a most
horrible Abuse of Scripture, apply the Words, Give to every
one that asketh thee, towards enticing the Women. " — "
Take hold, says Isidorus,

of some robust woman, that you be not plucked away from
Grace ; and when you have spent your seminal Fire, you may
pray with a good Conscience. ".
" Both Epiphanius, and Irenoeus before him, say of the
Founder of the Nicolaitans : ' Being ashamed of his own
Remissness, he audaciously pronounced, that no one, who
was not lascivious every Day could be Partaker of eternal life.
' •—" Therefore those Gnostics, after a Debauchery, were
used to boast of their Happiness, as having done a meritorious
Thing : and when they had their Will on a complying Female,
they told her ' she was now a pure Virgin' ; though she was
daily corrupted, and for many Years together. "
" This may be a proper Place to introduce The Confession
of Epiphanius; who in his Youth had fallen into the Gnostic
Heresy ; whence he received what he writes concerning them,
from the professed Teachers' own Mouths : when their
Women, one in particular, used all their Arts to debauch him.
But by the Help of the divine Grace he overcame their
temptations. I was then, says he, reproached by those pestilent
Women, who thus scoffingly talked with each other, ' We
would have saved this Youth, but not being able, we have
suffered him to perish in the Hands of the Principalities. ' For
the most beautiful among them makes herself the bait; and
those whom she enticeth, she is said not to destroy, but to
deliver. Whence the handsomest are used to upbraid those
who are less so ; ' I am an elect Vessel, able to save those
whom I attempt; which you have not Power to do. '
The most beautiful of them were employed to seduce me ;
but God delivered me from their Wickedness ; so that, after
reading their Books, I escaped from among them, and
discovered the several Names of them to the

122

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Bishops of those Parts ; and near eighty of them were sent
into Banishment. "
" The Valentinians, says Irenoeus, being in Love with
certain Women, would, without a Blush, seduce them from
their Husbands, and make them their own Wives. Others of
them, seemingly modest at first, pretended to live with them
as Sisters ; and in Process of Time were discovered, Sister
being found pregnant by Brother. "
" And to aggravate their wickedness, they esteemed
Copulation as a most sacred Mystery, known only to
themselves ; and which the Profane were not allowed to put in
Practice : What was abominable in others being highly
meritorious in themselves. For, saith Irenoeus again, ' They
have this Grace descending to them from the unspeakable and
unnameable Copulation above. For which Reason they ought
always to be meditating on the Mystery of Copulation.' And
thus they persuade silly People, addressing them in Discourse,
' Whoever is in the World and of the World, and mingleth with
a Woman is not of the Truth, nor shall pass into the Truth ;
because he mingleth in Concupiscence. ' Therefore
Continence, say they, is necessary to us natural Men ; but by
no means to themselves, who are spiritual and perfect; among
whom the Seed, small from above, is perfected here. "
Compare Ter-tullian, p. 261.
" To quote Clemens Alexandrinus. ' I will bring in to open
Light your most secret Mysteries : not ashamed to speak what
you are not ashamed to worship " i. e. the secrets of both
Sexes. ' For I may well call them Atheists, who impudently
worship those Parts, which modesty forbids to mention. "

LAMAISM

Lamaism was founded about 407 A. D. by a Bodi-satva
called, it is said, Chomschim, in Chinese Boyan-chi-yin, (the
voice which reflects the world) on the mountain Bouthala
around which was built the sacred city of Lhassa.
Lamaism is not only a religion, it is a theistic government.
In 1206, when Tibet was conquered by Ghengis Khan
(Mongol), Buddhism became the established religion but in
1368 when Tibet fell from the hands of the Mongols into
those of the Chinese, Lamaism, losing its temporal power,
became merely a religion, its spiritual power remaining
however the same and the religion of more than 250 million
men.
The Lamas are Priests of Buddha among the Mongols and
Tibetans, but Lamaism is not orthodox Buddhism.
Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, laid down the
following laws governing the attainment of Nirvana (state of
not being). Their enumeration will serve to show how
Buddhism and Lamaism differ.
According to that great teacher the ten obstacles which
prevent people from attaining the supreme liberation are : —
123

124

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

1. The belief in the " Ego ",
2. Doubt,
3. The belief in the efficacity of rites and ceremonies,
4. Sensual desires,
5. Anger,
6. The wish to live in a world less coarse than our own,
7. The wish to live in a more subtle world than our own,
8. Pride,
9. Agitation,
10. Ignorance.
The few quotations given hereafter from the very
remarkable books of Madame Alexandra David-Neel can
only serve to show students of these subjects the great value
of the books themselves.
Quoting Bhagavad Gita, she writes :
" Orthodox Buddhism denied the existence of a permanent
soul which transmigrated, and considered this theory as the
most pernicious of errors but the great majority of Buddhists
have fallen back into this old belief of the Hindus concerning
the 'jiva ' (self) which periodically changes its old body for a
new one, as we cast off old clothes for new. " 2
The Tibetan clergy comprises a theocratic aristocracy the
members of which are called Lamas, " tulkous ".
" According to popular belief, a tulkou is either the
reincarnation of a saint or dead sage or else the incarnation of
a superhuman being, a god or a demon.
In answer to a question she put to the Dalai-Lama on the
definition of the word " tulkou " Madame David-Neel quotes
him as saying : — "A Bodhisatva is the base from which can
spring numberless magical forms. The force he engenders by
a perfect concentration

110-111.

of thought enables him simultaneously to show a phantom
similar to himself in thousands and thousands of worlds. He
is not only able to create human forms, but every other kind
as well, even to inanimate objects such as houses, enclosures,
forests, roads, bridges, etc. etc. and he can produce
atmospheric phenomena, as well as the elixir of immortality
which quenches all thirst. (This expression, he explained, was
to be taken both in a literal and symbolic sense.)3
" In fact, concluded the Dalai-Lama, his power to create
Magic forms is limitless. "
" The Kandhomas are reincarnated women, fairies, and
may either be married or in holy orders. " 4
The usual method employed for locating the new body
appropriated by an old soul is the following : —
" A child answering to the prescribed conditions is
discovered and a lama diviner is consulted. Should he
pronounce in favour of the candidate the following form of
trial takes place : — Some personal belongings of the
deceased lama are mixed with other similar ones, and the
child must point out the first, thus proving that he recognizes
the things that were his in his former existence. 5
" This system assumed its present form towards the year
1650 when the fifth Grand Lama Lobzang Gyatso, having
become sovereign of Tibet, but wishing to acquire a higher
dignity, proclaimed himself the reincarnation (avatar) of
Tchenrezigs, a dignitary of the Mahayanist Pantheon.
Simultaneously he established his master as Grand Lama of
the monastery of Trachilhumpo, proclaiming him the
reincarnation
3. David-Neel, op. cit., p. 115.
4. Ibid, p. 111.
5. Ibid, p. 118.

126

OCCULT THEOCRASY

of Eupamed, a Mystic Buddha of whom Tchenrezigs was the
spiritual son.
" The example thus given by the lama-king stimulated the
creation of tulkous. Soon all monasteries made a point of
having at their head the incarnation of some celebrated
personage. Thus the Dalai-Lama, the political head of Tibet
today, is said still to be a reincarnation of Tchenrezigs and the
present Trachi Lama one of Eupamed. " 6
The palace of the Dalai-Lamas is the monastery of Gahlden
situated some twenty kilometres from Lhassa. It was founded
by Tsong Khapa in the XV century. Tsong Khapa, the
reformer, forbade marriage and the use of fermented
beverages to the clergy. His followers called Gelougspas are
known as the Yellow Sect and their favourite God is Jigsdjied,
the destroyer (the terrible), another version of the Hindu god
Siva. The Red Sect, the Sakyapas, those distinguished by
their red hats, are their religious opponents.
As regards the Tibetan gods and the ritual pertaining to
their worship Madame David-Neel gives us the following
most illuminating description :
" To the respiratory exercises repeated several times a day
the recluse often joins meditation-contemplation assisted by
Kyilkhors.
" A Kyilkhor, or magic circle, is a kind of diagram drawn
on paper or stuff or engraved on metal, stone or wood...
Deities or lamas are generally represented on them by little
pyramids of paste called ' torma. ' 7
" Kyilkhors are also designed with coloured powder on
boards or on the floor, but only such persons as have
received a special initiation may compose or
6. David-Neel, op. cit., p. 110.
7. Ibid, p. 259.

LAMAISM

127

draw them. Each Kyilkhor, moreover, requires a particular
initiation and that erected by a non-initiate would remain a
dead thing impossible to animate and powerless. An
advanced student, wishing to evoke a Bodhisatva or deity,
seeks to animate the Kyilkhor which has hitherto only served
as a focus for concentration.
" The Hindus endow magical diagrams as well as the
statues of deities with life before worshipping them. The
object of this rite, called prana-pratishtha, is to convey to the
inanimate object, by means of psychic currents, the energy of
the worshipper. The life thus infused into the latter is kept up
by the daily cult which is rendered it, for it lives on the
concentration of thought which has given it birth. Should it
suddenly be deprived of this subtle food, the living soul
within it will perish and die of inanition the object reverting
to its former condition of inert matter. " 8
The Tibetan mystics animate their Kyilkhor by a similar
method, but they do not aim at making it an object of worship
and the material representation of the Kyilkhor is abolished
when, after a certain amount of practice, it becomes purely a
mental image.
A tradition of the Kahgyudpas relates that the founder of
their sect, Marpa, was blamed by his master (guru) Narota for
having paid homage first to the Kyilkhor.
" It is I who constructed the Kyilkhor ", declared Narota. "
Its life and energy were infused in it by me. Without me, those
figures would be only inert objects. The gods that inhabit it
are born of my spirit therefore, it is to me that homage is
primarily due. " 9

" According to Tibetan occultists, these beings, (the gods)
have acquired a kind of real existence due to the innumerable
thoughts which have been concentrated on them 10.
" According to the Tibetans, during the celebration of a rite,
the thoughts of the officiating evocator, concentrated on the
deities who ' exist already ', cause these to become more
powerful and more real for him. By identifying himself with
them the evocator establishes contact with an accumulation of
energy infinitely greater than that which he alone might
generate. "n
Thus we must conclude that the gods of Eastern Magic
correspond to what our occidental scientists call
thought-forms. That these thought-forms can be projected
and reabsorbed into the person of their creator is a theory with
which all students of spiritism and psychic science are
familiar, but that they can detach from their makers and lead
separate existences, empowered for good or evil by the
collective thought-force of their worshippers, is an idea with
which the western world is still unfamiliar.
" Gods, Demons, the whole universe is a mirage, a fantasy
of the brain issuing therefrom and resolvant thereto. " n
" Thus the aim of the teaching is to bring the student to
understand that the world and all its phenomena are but
phantasms born of our own imagination. This in short is the
fundamental teaching of the Mystics of Tibet. " 13

an emaciated Yogi alone in a hut in the middle of the forest.
The master stopped, enquiring how long the ascetic had

the existence of another school of curious rites, presumably a

objectionable in the Oriental occultism, which has filtered
through to the Western world. There we are told that : — "A
certain class of Tibetan occultists teach a method of
semi-physical semi-psychic stimulation, which consists in
such singular practices as that of causing the seminal flow,

THE YEZIDEES (DEVIL WORSHIPPERS)

The sect of the Yezidees was founded by Sheik Adi in the
fifth century.
Mr. W. B. Seabrook's observations on the Yezidees, as
recorded in his book, Adventures in Arabia, form a basis for
the study of the beliefs of this sect.
According to his informant, the Yezidee faith is briefly
this : l
" God created seven spirits ' as a man lighteth one lamp
after another ', and the first of these spirits was Satan, whom
God made supreme ruler of the earth for a period of ten
thousand years. And because Satan was supreme master of
the earth, those who dwelt on it could prosper only by doing
him homage and worshipping him.
" Since the true name was forbidden ", Mechmed Hamdi
told me, " they referred to Shaitan as Melek Taos (Angel
Peacock) and worshipped him in the form of a brass bird ..."
While the name of Shaitan was forbidden ", he said, " so
much so that if a Yezidee hears it spoken, their law
commands him either to kill the man who uttered

it or kill himself — yet we could talk as freely with them
about Melek Taos as we could to a Christian about Jesus. "
A priest of the cult also volunteered the following
information to Mr. Seabrook on the Yezidee divinity.
" Our difference from all other religions is this — that we
know God is so far away that we can have no contact with
Him — and He, on his part, has no knowledge or interest of
any sort concerning human affairs. It is useless to pray to him
or worship Him. He cares nothing about us.
" He has given the entire control of this world for ten
thousand years to the bright spirit Melek Taos, and Him,
therefore, we worship. Moslems and Christians are wrongly
taught that he whom we call Melek Taos is the spirit of evil.
We know that this is not true. He is the spirit of power and the
ruler of this world. At the end of the ten thousand years of his
reign — of which we are now in the third thousand — he will
re-enter paradise as the chief of the Seven Bright Spirits, and
all his true worshippers will enter paradise with him. "
The Grand Priest of the order, the " Mir ", receives
one-seventh part of the harvests of the land. He is the arbiter
of all religious matters and under him rank seven
ecclesiastical orders.
The doctrine of the Yezidees is contained in three sacred
books The Black Book, The Revelation and The Contract with
the Devil; but a knowledge of reading and writing is
restricted to the priests of the first order and is classified by
the sect as a serious sin.

ORTHODOX ISLAM
The Arabian peninsula was the home of nomads and
mountaineers when, in the seventh century, Mahomet arose
as a self styled Prophet and the creator of Islam-ism. The
doctrine of Islam has three dogmas : —
1. Monotheism.
2. Belief in the Prophet, namely Mahomet.
3. The law of retribution.
The sacred book of Islamism, the Koran, was devoid of
mystic teaching. The Figh, for every believer, is the code of
morals and obligations such as fast, prayer, pilgrimage to
Mecca, etc. Mysticism was interjected into Islamism by
Sufism.
Mahomet aimed at the establishment of a religion which,
he declared, was revealed to him during periods of trance
which he frequently underwent. He was determined to
impose this religion on all the Arabs and, through much
bloodshed, he succeeded in stamping out the Koraishites
from whom he took Mecca.
The death of Mahomet was the signal for disruption among
his followers and innumerable divisions both political and
religious, from the history of the Arabs during their periods of
conquest which began immediately after the death of
Mahomet during the Khalifate of Omar (634-644).

UNORTHODOX ISLAM, THE ISHMAELITES, THE
LODGE OF CAIRO

Manicheism was not the only secret association that sprang
from the initiations of the Magi. In the seventh century of our
era we meet with similar societies, possessing an influence
not limited to the regions in which they arose, variations of
one single thought, which aimed at combining the venerable
doctrines of Zoroaster with Christian belief. Of these
societies or sects the following may be mentioned : the
followers of Keyoumerz; the worshippers of Servan, certain
Zoroastrians, so-called " Dualists " ; Gnostics and, lastly, the
followers of Mastek, the most formidable and disastrous of
all, preaching universal equality and liberty, the
irresponsibility of man, and the community of property and
women.
The Arabs having rendered themselves masters of Persia in
the seventh century, the sects of that country set to work to
spread their tenets among Islam in order to undermine it.
This is corroborated by Heckethorn who writes :
" The Persian sects examined the Koran, pointed out its
contradictions, and denied its divine origin. And so
134

UNORTHODOX

ISLAM

135

there arose in Islamism that movement which attacks dogmas,
and destroys faith, and substitutes for blind belief free
enquiry. " 1
In Persia and in Mesopotamia had spread the new
rationalism, the philosophical heresy of the Mutazi-lites
(schismatics) exposed by Hassan al-Basri.
The Jew Abdallah Ibn Saba 2 presented himself as the
prophet of the future Imam, who was to manifest. He meant
to overthrow the caliphate and to uphold the rights of
Mahomet al-Hanafi, the son of Ismael, the descendant of the
prophet by his daughter Fatima, the wife of Ali. Thus was
founded the Shi'a sect.
The Fatmite dynasty (from Fatima, daughter of Mahomet)
was founded in 909 A. D. when Ahmed-Said, the son of a
Jewess who had married the Shi'a chief al-Hussain,3
conquered Egypt and Syria, establishing the centre at Cairo.
Declaring himself to be the long expected Imam, Said, on
coming to power, assumed the name of Obaid Allah el-Mahdi.
4
The Fatmite dynasty lasted from 909 to 1171. Heckethorn
informs us that " The Doial-Doat, or supreme missionary or
judge, shared the power with the prince. 5
" Meetings were held in the Lodge at Cairo, which
contained many books and scientific instruments; science was
the professed object, but the real aim was very different. The
course of instruction was divided into nine degrees... the ninth
degree... as the necessary result of the teaching of all the
former, taught that nothing was to be believed, and that
everything was lawful.

" Egypt, especially, seems as if predestined to be the
birthplace of secret societies, of priests, warriors and fanatics.
It is the region of mysteries... Cairo has succeeded the ancient
Memphis, the doctrine of the Lodge of Wisdom that of the
Academy of Heliopolis... The throne of the descendants of
Fatima was to be surrounded with an army of assassins, a
formidable body-guard; a mysterious militia was to be raised,
that should spread far and wide the fame and terror of the
caliphate of Cairo, and inflict fatal blows on the abhorred rule
of Bagdad. The missionaries spread widely, and in Arabia and
Syria, partisans were won, to whom the designs of the order
were unknown, but who had with fearful solemnity sworn
blind obedience. "
The Fatmites had received from the sect the mission of
destroying, or at least of disrupting Islam. The successor of
Obaid-Allah continued this work, having himself proclaimed
a Shi'a while in reality he was sceptic. It was under the Caliph
Hakim that the Druses came into being.
The Shi'a sects who recognized Mohammed al-Hanafi as
the last living " Imam " were called Ismae-lites or Septimans.
From their midst sprang a secret body, the Khoja, which, in
spite of persecution still exists in Persia and India, where its
exoteric chief is the Anglicised Indian, the Aga Khan, whose
followers are the moneylenders of Islam, a profession
forbidden by Mahomet.
Still another Shi'a sect, the Duodecimans or Ima-nites,
recognize Mohamed al-Muntazar the twelfth Imam.
Under the Fatmite Caliph Hakim, a new religion sprang out
of Ismailism, that of the Druses, so called from its inventor, a
certain Darosi. This religion differs

UNORTHODOX

137

little from Ismailism, except that it introduces the dogma of
the incarnation of God himself on Earth, under the form of
the Caliph Hakim.
When the Fatmite Caliph Mostansir ascended the throne,
he re-established the Ismailian belief : and the Druses, driven
from Egypt, took refuge in Lebanon, where they still exist.

CHAPTER

DRUSES

The Druses, as afore stated, are a gnostic sect among the
Ismaelite Mahommedans. It was founded in the tenth century
during the reign of the Fatimite Caliph al-Hakim
Biambellalu.
The founder is usually recognised as Mohammed al Darazi
or al Druzi (Nouchtegin ben Ismail al Bokhari) born near
Bokhara cir. 960. He adopted the doctrine then preached by
al-Hakim of the successive reincarnations of the divinity
under human form l and wrote a treatise in which he
established the continuous series of divine incarnations
ending with the statement that the last living manifestation
was al-Hakim, the Caliph of Egypt. So pleased was al-Hakim
with the book that he called Mohammed al-Druzi to him, and
gave him great authority in the conduct of affairs. From that
time, al-Hakim who hitherto had been known as Biambellalu
that is " the one governing by the order of God, changed his
name to Biam-Eh meaning " the one governing by his own
right. " He then caused himself to be worshipped as God. The
public reading of Mohammed al-Druzi's book, in one of
Cairo's mosques, •caused popular riots and its author was
obliged to

flee from Egypt. He took refuge in the mountains of Syria and
made many proselytes by allowing his adepts the use of wine,
condoning licentiousness and encouraging the propagation of
ideas tending to the confiscation of property. Later, he
returned to Egypt but was confronted by the power gained by
one of his disciples, Hamza al-Hadi, who had become leader
of the Druses there. In the conflict that ensued, Mohammed al
Druzi took up arms against his rival and adversary and was
killed in 1019.
Hamza, later, went to Syria and Lebanon and preached to
the Druses the doctrine of al-Hakim such as prevailed in
Egypt. Hamza was declared the prophet, the Imam of
al-Hakim who, being the divine incarnation, will yet manifest
himself to the Druses, be their Messiah and give them all
earthly power. The sect is divided into three degrees:
Profanes, Aspirants and Wise.
The Druses, from a political point of view, are divided into
two parts, the Djumblatiehs and the Yezbe-kiehs and
religiously they have their own rites, mysteries, and exoteric
and esoteric doctrines. The high initiates or priests rule the
people and through religious fanaticism have reduced the
Druses to a state of theocrasy with all its attendant law of fear
and numerous restrictions upon which theocratic power can
alone be edified.
In his book on Secret Societies, Heckethorn comments on
the similarity existing between the law of the Druses and that
of the Jews whereby " to a brother, perfect truth and
confidence are due but it is allowable, nay, a duty, to be false
towards men of another creed. "
Subsequently, he draws yet another comparison between
the Druses and the Freemasons and mentions the Masonic
degrees of " The United Druses " and " Commanders of
Lebanon ".

CHAPTER

THE ASSASSINS

The Judeo-Shi'a sect of the Assassins or Hashish-ims was
founded in 1090 by Hassan Sabah, a Persian, who had been
initiated into Ismailism at Cairo, in the household of the
Fatimite Caliph, al-Mostansir. He was known as " The Old
Man " or rather " The Lord of the Mountain ". His influence in
Egypt having excited the envy of many, he was sent into exile.
Caliph al-Mustansir's " vizir was a Jew named Abu Mansur
Sadakah ibn Yussuf ", l under whose protection Hassan
traversed Persia as a missionary, preaching and making
proselytes, and, having seized the fortress of Alamut, on the
borders of Irak and Dilem, which he called the " House of
Fortune ", he there established his rule.
The history of his time is full of his name. Kings in the very
centre of Europe trembled at it; his powerful arm reached
everywhere.
According to Heckethorn, " he reduced the nine degrees
into which the adherents of the Lodge of Cairo were divided
to seven, placing himself at the head, with title of Seydna or
Sidna, whence the Spanish Cid, and the Italian Signore.
The term Assassins is a

corruption of Hashishim, derived from Hashish (Indian hemp)
with which the chief intoxicated his followers when they
entered on some desperate enterprise.2
" To regulate the seven degrees he composed the
Catechism of the Order. The first degree recommended to the
missionary attentively to watch the disposition of the
candidate, before admitting him to the order. The second
impressed it upon him to gain the confidence of the candidate,
by flattering his inclinations and passions ; the third, to
involve him in doubts and difficulties by showing him the
absurdity of the Koran ; the fourth, to exact from him a
solemn oath of fidelity and obedience, with a promise to lay
his doubts before his instructor ; and the fifth, to show him
that the most famous men of Church and State belonged to
the secret order. The sixth, called ' Confirmation ', enjoined
on the instructor to examine the proselyte concerning the
whole preceding course, and firmly to establish him in it. The
seventh finally, called the ' Exposition of the Allegory ', gave
the keys of the sect.
" The followers were divided into two great hosts, '
self-sacrificers ' and ' aspirants '. The first, despising fatigues,
dangers, and tortures, joyfully gave their lives whenever it
pleased the master, who required them either to protect
himself or to carry out his mandates of death. "
According to the legend " the man selected by the lord to
perform the dangerous exploit was first made drunk, and in
this state carried into a beautiful valley where he was, on
waking, surrounded by lovely sylph-like women who made
him believe he was in Elysium ; but ere he wearied or became
satiated with

love and wine, he was once more made drunk, and in this state
carried back to his own home. When his services were
required, he was again sent for by the lord, who told him that
he had once permitted him to enjoy paradise, and if he would
do his bidding he could luxuriate in the same delights for the
rest of his life. The dupe, believing that his master had the
power to do all this, was ready to commit whatever crime was
required of him. "
" Several Christian princes were suspected of conniving at
the deeds of the Assassins. Richard of England is one of them ;
and it has been the loyal task of English writers to free him
from the charge of having instigated the murder of Conrad of
Montferrat... There also existed for a long time a rumour that
Richard had attempted the life of the King of France through
Hassan and his Assassins. The nephew of Barbarossa,
Frederick II, was excommunicated by Innocent II for having
caused the Duke of Bavaria to be slain by the Assassins ; and
Frederick II, in a letter to the King of Bohemia, accuses the
Duke of Austria of having by similar agents attempted his life.
"
The corruption of the Order of The Templars which
brought about its downfall has been imputed by most
historians to this sect which was suppressed in 1256, when
the Mongolians, led by Prince Hulagu, attacked and
overthrew them.

Blanchard, writing of it, says : —
" During the middle ages, the most eminent warriors and
noblemen of Europe entered its ranks. The Knights of the Temple
became the bulwark of the Holy Land against the Saracens. France,
England and other countries formed associations (Priories) of
Templar Knights, each with its own Grand Master and other officers.
Such great wealth was accumulated in the treasuries of the order that
in the year 1185 its annual income represented a sum equal to thirty
millions of dollars. The Templars were bankers and loaned money
on their own terms. But wealth and prosperity naturally led to
licentiousness, neglect of Templar law and in the end destruction.
":
Having embraced Gnosticism while in Palestine, and in touch
with the sect of the Assassins, the Templar order degenerated, and
some of its members, under the influence of that sect, were said to
practice Phallicism or sex-worship and Satanism and to venerate "
The Baphomet ", the idol of the Luci-ferians. The crime of Sodomy
was a rite of Templar initiation.
It is here interesting to note that the Phallus holds the lowest rank
in Brahmin theology for, in countries where the people are virtually
enslaved by superstition, this kind of heresy is useful to the ruling
classes.
Morris thus summarizes the fall of the Templars. " In the year
1307, the Grand Master of the order, Jacques de Molay, was
arrested in Paris with sixty of his knights and imprisoned upon
charges of idolatry and other crimes. Shortly afterward, all the
Knights Templar in France were put in prison in Paris. May 12,
1310, fifty-four of them were burnt alive. March 18, 1314, the
Grand Master, with three of his most

eminent officers, suffered in like manner. The great
possessions of the order were now confiscated and the society
suppressed both by the Pope and the leading monarchs of
Europe. " 2
In England, the Knights Templar were dissolved in the
reign of Edward II, and after the grant of their properties to
the Knights Hospitallers, these in their turn were dissolved
by Henry VIII.
After the death of Molay, the Knights Templar found a
protector in King Dinis II of Portugal who reformed the order
in 1317, under the name Knights of Christ.
A complete bibliography of literature both in print and in
manuscript, dealing with the subject of the Knights Templar

THE ROSICRUCIANS

Speculation has been rife as to the origin of the
Rosicrucians, and the many fables and legends connected
with the subject have but little historical value.
Owing to the great discrepancy between the information
contained in the following article and that given in the more
modern editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, it has been
deemed advisable to reprint the former. (See Enc. Brit., 3r
Edition, Vol. 16, year MDCCXCVII (1797) Edinburgh. Bell
and Macfarquhar.)
" Rosicrucians, a name assumed by a sect or cabal of
hermetical philosophers ; who arose, as it has been said, or at
least became first taken notice of in Germany, in the
beginning of the fourteenth century. They bound themselves
together by a solemn secret, which they all swore inviolably
to preserve : and obliged themselves, at their admission into
the order, to a strict observance of certain established rules.
They pretended to know all sciences, and chiefly medicine :
whereof they published themselves the restorers. They
pretended to be masters of abundance of important secrets,
and, among others, that of the philosopher's stone : all which
they affirmed to have received by tradition from the ancient
Egyptians, Chaldeans, the Magi, and Gymnosophists.
147

They have been distinguished by several names, accommodated to the several branches of their doctrine. Because
they pretend to protect the period of human life, by means of
certain nostrums, and even to restore youth, they were called
Immortals ; as they pretended to know all things, they have
been called Illuminati; and because they have made no
appearance for several years, unless the sect of Illuminated
which lately started up on the continent derives its origin from
them, they have been called the Invisible Brothers. Their
society is frequently signed by the letters F. R. C. which some
among them interpret fratres roris cocti; it being pretended
that the matter of the philosopher's stone is dew concocted,
exalted, etc. Some, who are no friends to free-masonry, make
the present flourishing society of free-masons a branch of
Rosicrucians ; or rather the Rosicrucians themselves, under a
new name or relation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is
certain, there are some free-masons who have all the
characters of Rosicrucians ; but how the aera and original of
masonry, and that of Rosicrucianism here fixed
from
Nadaeus, who has written expressly on
the subject, conflict, we leave others to judge.....................
Notwithstanding the pretended antiquity of the Rosicrucians,
it is probable that the alchemists, Paracel-sists, ' or
fire-philosophers, who spread themselves through almost all
Europe about the close of the 16th century, assumed about
this period the obscure and ambiguous title of Rosicrucian
brethren, which commanded at first some degree of respect,
as it seemed to be borrowed from the arms of Luther, which
were a cross placed upon a rose. But the denomination

evidently appears to be derived from the science of chemistry. It is
not compounded, says Motheim, as many imagine of the two words
rosa and crux, which signify rose and cross, but of the latter of these
words, and the Latin ros, which signifies dew. ... At the head of
these fanatics were Robert Fludd, an English physician, Jacob
Behmen, and Michael Mayer ; but if rumour may be credited, the
present Illuminated have a head of higher rank. The common
principles, which serve as a kind of centre of union to the
Rosicrucian society, are the following : They all maintain that the
dissolution of bodies, by the power of fire, is the only way by which
men can arrive at true wisdom, and come to discern the first
principles of things. They all acknowledge a certain analogy and
harmony between the powers of nature and the doctrines of religion ;
and believe that the Deity governs the kingdom of grace by the
same laws with which he rules the kingdom of nature ; and hence
they are led to use chemical denominations to express the truth of
religion. They all hold that there is a sort of divine energy, or soul,
diffused through the frame of the universe, which some call the
argheus, others the universal spirit, and which others mention under
different appellations. They all talk in the most superstitious
manner of what they call the signatures of things, of the power of
the stars, over all corporeal beings, and their particular influence
upon the human race, of the efficacy of magic, and the various ranks
and orders of demons — These demons they divide into two
orders, sylphs and gnomes. " 2

THEOCRASY

This article having been written in 1747 only hinted at what
the Rose Croix might have been. Subsequent research upon
the organization of the Fraternity, its tenets and its
achievements, shows it to have been a medium for the
propagation of Gnosticism and a centre for political activities.
Before it conquered Freemasonry, which was officially
instituted in 1717, many names were already associated
intimately with this esoteric organization. Among others were
Faustus Socinius, Cesare Cremonini, Michael Maier,
Valentin Andrea, Thomas Vaughan (Philaletes), Charles
Blount, Frede-rich Helvetius, Richard Simon, and Theophilus
Desa-guliers.
It is claimed that Faustus Socinius, named after Faustus,
the Manichee, nephew of Lelius Socinius, whose teacher was
Camillo Renato, was an intimate of Rosicrucianism and the
founder of the Socinians.
Catholics and Protestants alike opposed Faustus Socinius in
his efforts to graft a secret cult on the existing orthodox
religions, and in 1598, the people of Cracovia, revolted by his
doctrines, pillaged his house, burned his books and
manuscripts and almost massacred their author. He had sworn
hatred to the church and busied himself in founding an
association the aims of which were to be subversive to all its
teachings, and two years before his death, he was obliged to

The membership of the Rose Croix was composed of
Alchemists, Astrologers and Spiritists whose quest was the
search for a process for transmuting base metals into gold and
the secret of life. To most of these " generation was the

with the appearance of two books, Fama Fraternitatis and
the Confessio attributed to Valentin Andrea giving the
legend of the travels of Christian Rosenkreutz.
According to Charles T. MacClenachan 33°, Historian,
Grand Lodge State of New York, this same legend had
appeared as the work of Raymond Lulli, who died in 1315.
In this legend, translated into English in 1616 by Robert
Fludd, a symbolic personage called Christian Rosenkreuz,
destined to live 106 years on earth, travelled in the East where
he studied the Cabala and, on his return to his native Germany,
he revealed to three disciples the secret of secrets, the great
secret of theosophy. 4 Finally, he retired to a cave to finish his
days in solitude, dying in 1484 at the age of 106. His disciples
came, enshrouded him and disappeared. His grave was to be
unknown for six times twenty years at the end of which
period it was to become the hearth of the light destined to
illuminate the world at the time appointed by God. In 1604,
chance brought men to this cave. On entering, great was their
surprise to find it resplendent with a bright light. It contained
an altar bearing upon a copper plate the inscription " Living, I
reserved this light for my grave. " One mysterious figure was
accompanied by this epigram " Never vacant ". A second
figure " The Yoke of the Law ". A third figure " The Liberty
of the Gospels ". A fourth " The Glory of the Whole God ".
The hall still contained lamps burning without fuel, mirrors of
various shapes and boks. Upon the wall was written " In six
times twenty years I will be discovered ". The prophecy was
fulfilled, adds the fable, by way of conclusion.

The movement was greatly furthered by the impulse given
it when, after the appearance of the Fama Frater-nitatis and
Confessio, a German Alchemist, Michael Maier, an English
Physician, Robert Fludd and a Pietist, Julius Sperber, wrote
treatises in defence or explanation of the order of the Rose
Croix.
It has repeatedly been stated that Michael Maier, who
frequently visited England, was a friend of Robert Fludd. He
was the author of Themis Aurea and Silentium post Clamores,
both Rosicrucian works. His political influence may be
judged from his career. Physician to Rudolf II, he was created
by him Count of the Palatinate, and acted as adviser to his
sovereign. In 1609, Rudolf II issued an Imperial Charter
granting religious liberty to the Moravians.5
Masonic authorities state that Maier, as a Rosicrucian,
changed his official title to Summus Magister, Sovereign
Master, which is that used by all his successors and borne by
the principal Socinian Rose-Croix documents, dating from
the time of Faustus Socinius to that of Johann Wolff, which
are preserved in the Sovereign Patriarchal Council of
Hamburg. (That is the Supreme Jewish Lodge secretly
affiliated to International Masonry.)
In his book Themis Aurea, written in 1616 and 1617 and
printed in 1618, Maier, the Grand Master, refers to a
resolution passed at a meeting in 1617 in which it was
formally agreed that the Brotherhood of the Rose Croix must
maintain the strictest secrecy for a hundred years. On October
31 1617, the Convention of the Seven at Magdebourg had
indeed agreed to qualify its members during the ensuing one
hundred years

of secrecy as " The Invisibles ". It had renewed its oath to
destroy the church of Jesus Christ and had decreed that, in the
year 1717, it would transform the fraternity into an
association which could carry on a more or less open
propaganda, while adopting such meas-sures of prudence as
might then be deemed expedient by the leaders of the sect.
Finally, the Seven adopted definitely, as being sufficiently
original to appeal to the popular imagination, Valentin
Andrea's curious story of the Rose Croix which had been
secretly print-ted in Venice towards 1613.
Robert Fludd was the author of Tractatus Apologe-ticus
(1617) and Clavis Philosophiae et Alchymiae (1633). He was
greatly helped in the foundation of the Rose Croix order in
England by Francis Bacon, author of Nova Atlantis 6 (1624).
Valentin Andrea to whom, as we have seen, are ascribed
the works Fama and Confessio, as well as Che-mycal
Nuptials, had, in 1640, been appointed preacher to the Duke
of Brunswick Wolfenbuttel, who was soon to make him his
chaplain.
To those who know the important part played by a Duke of
Brunswick during the French Revolution, this entrance of the
Brunswick family into the sect is very interesting. As a
Rosicrucian, Andrea was the teacher of Comenius (Amos
Kominsky), who frequently visited England during his
mysterious political career. Bishop of a Moravian community,
Comenius was the leader of the Moravian Brethren, a sect
pledged to achieve the extermination of the Catholic church
and which, being considered heretical, was also suspected of
practising secret satanism. The Moravians were imbued with
Socinianism, that is the doctrine of Lelius

Socinius which had been spread among them by his. nephew
Faustus Socinius who had found refuge in Moravia when
persecuted by the Church. Their link with Rosicrucianism had
already been established in the person of the pietist, Julius
Sperber, who was also one of their leaders. When Kominsky
was persecuted, he first went to London in 1641 and, early the
next year, went to Sweden where he was granted refuge and
help by the powerful Swedish Minister, Count Axel
Oxenstiern, himself a Rosicrucian adept and protector of
another initiate, Ludwig van Geer from Holland.
The combination of the pursuit of alchemy and
her-meticism with political aims was frequently evidenced
even before the official appearance of Rosicrucianism. The
influence of adepts on the destinies of nations was immense.
To Queen Elizabeth, the advice of John Dee, her alchemist,
was always considered in matters affecting national policy,
and to Dee, his crystal gazer, Edward Kelly, was
indispensable as a medium. 7
Ludwig van Geer, (one of the Seven present at
Magdebourg) had settled in Sweden and had won over the
chancellor, Count Axel Oxenstiern, then the real regent, in
view of the minority of Queen Christina. A great industrialist
of Dutch birth, with a colossal fortune made in the
manufacture of cannon, he had become a Baron, and as owner
of 20 ships of the Swedish fleet, he was an indispensable
man.
Another striking Rosicrucian figure was Thomas Vaughan,
(Eugenius Philaletes) not to be confused with his pupil,
George Starkey, known as Irenius Philaletes.
It is said that it was Thomas Vaughan who, inspired
7. Charlotte Fell Smith, op. cit., p. 182.

by the writings of Nick Stone, conceived the idea of
subverting to the ambition of the sect to which he belonged,
the guild of the Freemasons which, owing to its universal
character, lent itself better than any other to the realization of
his project.
Nick Stone was one of the Seven of the Convention of
Magdebourg. As an architect, belonging to the guild of the
Freemasons, he had helped Inigo Jones, the grand-master of
the English Lodges which, at this period, were nonsectarian.
On the other hand, as a Rosicrucian he had grasped, in the
Luciferian sense, the idea given by Faustus Socinius, and he
had composed, for the nine grades of the fraternity, rituals
which the chiefs declared remarkable. His ritual of the eighth
degree (Magister Templi) was really Satanic.
Thomas Vaughan, struck by these manuscripts wondered
whether it would be possible to extend the teaching of the
Rose Croix to all " accepted masons ", who were then
admitted to the lodges in an honorary capacity ; the
Freemasons received in their guild, under the name of "
accepted masons ", peers and men of letters or professional
men, as well as rich bourgeois, who enhanced the brilliancy
of their meetings and patronized their entertainments. These
honorary members were their protectors and benefactors. 8
Vaughan believed that this element, gifted with certain
intellectual qualities, would lend itself better to the
propagation of the principles of occult Socinian-ism than the
workers of the Fellow Craft, and, having made up his mind
that this was the solution of the problem, he hastened to put it
into practice.
8. This is still customary. Many of the English Guilds of
today such as the Goldsmiths have honorary members who,
for attending their dinners receive a box of chocolates and £3 in
cash.

Some brothers of the Rose Croix were already mingling
with the Freemasons. Among the members of the Warrington
Lodge were Richard Penkett, James Collier, Richard Sankey,
Henry Littler, John Ellam and Hugh Brewer and in London,
the Whartons and their friends had slipped into a lodge as "
accepted masons ".
Thomas Vaughan encouraged them to spread the
principles of Socinius. Finally, at a meeting on the 14th May
1643, he announced that their desultory efforts at restrained
proselytizing should be supplanted by a definite programme
of entering the guild lodges with the object of using them as
instruments to an end.
The account of this meeting of the 14th May 1643, is given
in full in the Memoirs of Philaletes and the whole plan of the
Freemasonry of today is therein revealed.
So blended are truth and fiction in the active career of this
adventurous adept that Vaughan must always remain one of
the most mysterious characters of Rosicrucianism.
" When the plague of 1665 drove the Court from London to
Oxford, Thomas Vaughan went thither with his patron (the
king) and, a little later, took up his residence with the Rector
of Albury, the Rev. Sam. Kem, at whose house, on February
27th of that year, he was killed by an explosion in the course
of chemical experiments. " 9
His work in Masonry however has remained as his
monument. Together with Elias Ashmole, pupil of Rabbi
Solomon Frank and protege of James Pagitt, Thomas
Vaughan worked up the masonic system of the first three
degrees. These degrees, those of Entered Apprentice, Fellow
Craft and Master Mason were

devised for the temptation of the masses, while outside and
above them continued the former secret system of the Rose
Croix, four degrees of which belonging to the Gold Cross
were known as : 1st, Zelator ; 2nd, Theoricus; 3rd, Practicus ;
and 4th, Philosophus; teaching merely the principles of
alchemy, while the degrees of the Rose Croix were : 5th,
Adeptus Minor; 6th, Adeptus Major ; 7th, Ademptus
Exemptus, 8th, Magister Templi and 9th, Magus.
Contemporaneous with the evolution of free thought
against revealed religion broke the revolution against civil
authority plunging England into the throes of civil war,
Oliver Cromwell was successful at the head of the Parliament
troops while Charles I was everywhere betrayed by men on
whom he relied. Henry Blount10 was among the traitors
accruing to Cromwell after the battle of Edgehill; at least the
defeat of the king was his pretext, for treason was everywhere
premeditated. The word of order was given by the Rose Croix,
which had spread rapidly among the Puritans.
The year 1644 ended with the destruction of the Royal
power, and Feb. 9, 1649, the day on which the head of
Charles I fell at Whitehall, consummated its ruin. The Royal
power had in fact been wrecked when the troops of
Parliament were victorious, when the queen was obliged to
take refuge in France, when the Prince Palatine, Robert, had
been defeated, when York had been taken, and when the
Commons had obtained against Laud, the Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of London, Archbishop of Canterbury, the
bill of attainder which declared him guilty of the crime of
treason. Laud had stood for resistance to the Puritans.

The connection of the Cromwell family with that of the
celebrated Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, whose political
ideas, formed in Italy, under the guidance of Machiavelli, had
so greatly affected the trend of English history, is here not
devoid of interest.
In 1767, a document was discovered which revealed the
existence of a society of Freemasons in Italy with about
64,000 members. " n
The document said : — "At last the great mine of the
Freemasons of Naples is discovered, of whom the name, but
not the secret, was known. Two circumstances are alleged by
which the discovery was brought about : — a dying man
revealed all to his confessor, that he should inform the king
thereof ; a knight, who had been kept in great state by the
society, having had his pension withheld, betrayed the Grand
Master of the order to the king. This Grand Master was the
Duke of San Severe The king secretly sent a confidential
officer with three dragoons to the duke's mansion, with orders
to seize him before he had time to speak to any one, and bring
him to the palace. The order was carried out; but a few
minutes after, a fire broke out in the duke's mansion,
destroying his library, the real object being, as is supposed, to
burn all writings having reference to Freemasonry. The fire
was extinguished, and the house guarded by troops. The duke
having been brought before the king, openly declared the
objects, system, seals, government, and possessions of the
order. He was sent back to his palace, and there guarded by
troops, lest he should be killed by his former colleagues.
Freemasons have also been discovered at Florence, and

"have sent thither twenty-four theologians to put a stop to the
disorder. The king acts with the greatest mercy towards all
implicated, to avoid the great dangers that might ensue from a
contrary course. He has also appointed four persons of great
standing to use the best means to destroy so abominable a sect;
and has given notice to all the other sovereigns of Europe of
his discovery, and the abominable maxims of the sect, calling
upon them to assist in its suppression, which it will be folly in
them to refuse to do. For the order does not count its members
by thousands, but by millions, especially among Jews and
Protestants. Their frightful maxims are only known to the
members of the fifth, sixth, and seventh lodges, whilst those
of the first three know nothing, and those of the fourth act
without knowing what they do. They derive their origin from
England, and the founder of the sect was that infamous
Cromwell, first Bishop, and then lover of Anne Boleyn, and
then beheaded for his crimes, called in his day ' the scourge of
rulers. ' He left the order an annual income of £10,000 sterling.
It is divided into seven lodges : the members of the seventh
are called Assessors ; of the sixth, Grand Masters ; of the fifth,
Architects ; of the fourth, Executors (here the secret ends); of
the third, Ruricori (!) ; of the second and first, Novices and
Proselytes. Their infamous idea is based on the allegory of the
temple of Solomon, considered in its first splendour, and then
overthrown by the tyranny of the Assyrians, and finally
restored — thereby to signify the liberty of man after the
creation of the world, the tyranny of the priesthood, kings and
laws, and the re-establishment of that liberty. "
As for Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, there
is no record of his having been an " accepted mason ". He
was however on the best of terms with

Richard Penkett and is supposed by many to have been

not he served the purpose of the sect, destruction of the Royal
and Ecclesiastical Christian Power !
After the death of Charles I, Cromwell appointed an
assembly of lawyers and divines to consider the petition of
Manasseh ben Israel (1604-1657) demanding the abolition of
the legal exclusion of the Jews from England. In December
1655 the legal prohibition was removed. Eleven years after
(1666) occurred the great fire of London.
Does the following letter help to solve the mystery of this
historical disaster ? It was one of many written by the

Thus it came about that all blows dealt to Christianity and

CATHARES, ALBIGENSES, WALDENSES

Manicheism, with its hierarchy and missionary system, had
taken root in Europe and, with its chief seat in Bulgaria, had
thus found its way into Northern Italy and the southern part of
France.
Unquestionably Manicheans in their beliefs and teachings,
the Cathares (purifiers or pure) held the unadulterated
tradition of Manes. Their hierarchy was that established by
their founder. In the 12th century, their supreme chief was in
Bulgaria having under him, bishops, priests, deacons and
simple Perfects. These composed the class of Perfects who
were distinguished from the second degree of Believers.
As to the Albigenses, their name derived from Albi, a town
of Languedoc, covered not one but many sects issued from
Manicheism and Arianism, and counted also many Jews or
judaised Christians. Under this appellation of Albigenses,
historians, whether political or religious, have almost
unanimously included the Cathares.
A revolt against the then existing Church power of the 12th
century is only too comprehensible, when one recollects the
excesses of which popes, bishops and almost all dignitaries
of the Church were guilty. The
163

164

OCCULT THEOCRASY

pioneers of the rebellion had been Peter of Bruys (died 1126)
and the monk Henri (died 1148).
They had openly attacked the vices of the clergy and fallen
victims, the first to his own fanaticism (he was killed by the
mob whose anger he had aroused by pulling down a wooden
cross to be used as burning wood for the purpose of cooking
meat on a Good Friday); the second was imprisoned by a
bishop against whose vices he had raised his voice. Both had
attacked the beliefs and practices of the Church ; like the
Baptists of today they rejected the practice of baptism for
children, and denied the dogmas of transubstantiation and
redemption through Christ.
They gained many adherents and left numerous disciples
whose Manichean opposition to the Church was identical
with that of the Cathares. Upon such grounds fell the
preaching of Peter Waldo who, although he repudiated the
dualist doctrine of the Manicheans, formed a serious
opposition to the Church. He created the sect of the
Waldenses divided in two degrees, Perfect and Believers. The
former made a vow of Poverty and as such took the names of
Poor Brethren, the latter formed the Outer or Third Order.
From the South of France and Northern Italy, persecution
drove the Waldenses to the Central and Northern provinces of
France, thence to England, then from Lombardy into
Germany and Bohemia. John Wickliffe (1324-1384) in
England and John Huss (1369-1415) in Bohemia, were their
foremost representatives and in the latter country they formed
the Bohemian Brethren who later also took the name of
Moravian Brethren or Religious Masons.

THE MORAVIANS

OR THE MORAVIAN BROTHERS OF THE ORDER OF RELIGIOUS
FREEMASONS, OR ORDER OF THE MUSTARD-SEED, OR THE
CHURCH UNITAS FRATRUM, OR THE HERRENHUTER.

Margrave Albert expelled the Jews from the town of Iglau,
in Moravia, on the ground that they had been in league with
the Taborites, the subversive element among the Hussites.
The Taborites were Bohemians.
The Moravian Brothers or Unitas Fratrum, a Gnostic sect,
were founded in 1457 at Kunewald, near Seftenberg, by
Gregory ; the nephew of the Calixtine leader Rokyzana. They
were an offshoot of the Bohemian Brethren said to represent
the religious kernel of the Hussite movement.
At the Synod of Lhota near Reichenau, in 1467, they
constituted themselves into a Church separate from the
Calixtine or National church of Bohemia.
The constitution of the society was revised at a second
Synod held at Lhota under the direction of Luke of Prague,
who may be regarded as their second founder. This
reorganization enabled the society to grow rapidly. In the
early years of the 16th cent, the
165

166

Unitas included nearly 400 congregations in Bohemia and
Moravia, with 150,000 members, and, including Poland,
embraced three provinces — Bohemia, Moravia, where the
Jews are the best educated of the inhabitants, and in a few
small towns form a full half of the population, and Poland.
Each province had its own bishops and synods, but all were
united in one church and governed by the general synod.
The Lutheran movement in Germany awakened lively
interest among the Brethren, and some unsuccessful attempts
were made under the leadership of Agusta to unite with the
Lutheran Church (1528-1546); but when the Calvinist
reformation reached Bohemia, the Brethren found themselves
more in sympathy with it than with the Lutheran. The Jesuit
anti-reformation, instigated by Rudolf and his brothers
Matthias and Ferdinand, found the Brethren a prosperous
church, but the pitiless persecution which followed the
unsuccessful attempt at revolution crushed the whole Protestantism of Bohemia, and in 1627 the Evangelical churches
there had ceased to exist. About the same time, the Polish
branch of the Unity, in which many refugees from Bohemia
and Moravia had found a home, was absorbed in the
Reformed Church of Poland. A few families, however,
especially in Moravia, held religious services in secret,
preserved the traditions of their fathers, and, in spite of the
vigilance of their enemies, maintained some correspondence
with each other. In 1722, some of these left home and property
to seek a place where they could worship in freedom. The first
company, led by Christian David, a mechanic, settled by
invitation from Count Zinzendorf 1 on his

estate at Bertheldsdorf near Zittau, in Saxony. They were
soon joined by others (about 300 coming within seven years),
and built a town which they called Her-renhut. The small
community at first adopted the constitution and teaching of
the old Unitas. The episcopate had been continued, and in
1735, David Nitsch-mann was consecrated first bishop of the
Renewed Moravian Church. The new settlement was not,
however, destined to be simply a revival of the organization
of the Bohemian Brethren. Zinzendorf, who had given them
an asylum, came with his wife, family, and chaplain to live
among the refugees. He was a Lutheran who had accepted
Spener's pietism, and he wished to form a society distinct
from national churches and devoted to good works. After long
negotiations, a union was effected between the Lutheran
element and the adherents of the ancient Unitas Fratrum. The
emigrants at Herrenhut attended the parish church at
Berthelsdorf, and were simply a Christian (Gnostic) society
within the Lutheran Church. (Ecclesiola in ecclesia). This
peculiarity is still to some extent preserved in the German
branch of the church, and the Moravian Brethren's
Congregation within the Evangelical Protestant churches,
which enables them to do evangelistic work without
proselytizing. The society adopted a code of rules in 1727,
and ordained twelve elders to carry on pastoral work. This
was the revival of the Unitas Fratrum as a church.
Besides congregational work, special home missions were
and are carried on in each province. In the German province
there is a peculiar home mission called the
Diaspora,2

which dates from 1829.

" Of what dangerous Consequence the Moravian System is
to Government and Civil Society, appears by their
progressive Multiplicity of Prevarications, Lies, Frauds,
Cheats, and juggling Impostures, (Greatly detrimental to
Princes and States, as well as ruinous to private Persons)
which have so plainly been proved by Mr. Rimius, and others,

have been proved upon the Moravians, both as to Doctrine
and Practice, by divers Instances. And that in Fact they claim
an Independency on Government appears from the ' Letter to
the Regency of Budingen, from the Count (Zinzendorf) and
his Brethren, wherein it is said, in plain Terms, ' That all the
Sovereigns on Earth must consent to the Theocracy in the
Moravian Brotherhood, or have no Brethren in their
Dominions. ' I need not add, that Theocracy signifies an
immediate Government by God, which of Course excludeth
all Civil Authority. "
The Moravian dogma was Spiritism which generally
means Black Magic.
As for their moral code, it can be summarized in the few
following words of Count Zinzendorf in a dialogue with Mr.
Wesley. " We reject all Self Denial, we trample it under Foot.
We Believers do what we please, and no more. "

THE ANABAPTISTS
(Founded 1521)

The Anabaptists were founded in 1521 by Nicolas Storch,
Mark Stubner and Thomas Muncer.
Their Heresies were founded on the following Lutheran
maxim interpreted subversively : A Christian man is master
of everything and is subject to no one. They further claimed
that infant baptism is null, therefore adults only can be
baptized.
" If the Anabaptists ", writes Hoeninghaus, a German
Protestant writer, in La Reforme contre la Reforme, were not
all equally intolerant, they were nevertheless all equally
detested, hated, and persecuted by the Protestants much more
than by the Catholics. "
Queen Elizabeth ordered them to be excluded from
England.
Madden, in Phantasmata, describes their religion in the
following terms :
" We find among them claims to intercourse with God and
angels — to the gift of prophecy — to the power of driving
out evil spirits — to the right of persecuting opponents — to
visions, ecstasies, trances, convulsive seizures attributed to
supernatural influences — and all these evi171

172

OCCULT THEOCRASY

dences of epidemic religious mania in countries which were
Protestant. " 1
At certain periods in its history, this sect wielded great
power and Madden further writes that in Westphalia " for a
length of time, the entire senate was composed of
theomaniacs. As the republic was composed alone of fools
and madmen, it is incredible to what a length they carried
their excesses in Munster : each magistrate proposed for the
rule of government the wild chimeras of his own imagination,
disguised under the imposing name of revelation. It was a sad
spectacle to hear the deliberations of a senate composed
altogether of fanatics : some being inspired in a perfectly
contrary way to that suggested to others : nevertheless, each
one adhering to the dictates of his inspiration, because he
believed that a special revelation had been made to him.
When such things, says Calmeil, take place in a country,
where pseudo-prophets are tolerated who disseminate terror,
and run about the streets without any clothing, when the
multitude set these things down as super-human phenomena ;
when the inspired of both sexes walk about thus in public
places in the midst of their disciples and apostles, the will of
the Supreme Being is supposed to serve as a rule and direction
to all the extravagances that mortals fall into, and it is difficult
to say where will end the excesses of this religious delirium...
The Anabaptists, when they fell into the hands of their
enemies, allowed their fingers, tongue, nose and ears, to be
cut off, nay, even suffered themselves to be drowned by
hundreds in torrents, rather than desist or depart for a moment
from the orders they imagined came from God. " 2

In 1525, Luther headed an alliance of the Princes and
governments to repress these excesses, and they were
defeated at the Battle of Frankenhausen in that year, their
leader Thomas Muncer being seized and beheaded.
In 1536, John of Leyden proclaimed himself King of the
New Jerusalem but his glory was of short duration. He was
taken by " the ungodly " and put to death.
The principal leaders of the sect were John Mathias, John
Bockhold, David George, William Hacket, Kotte-rus,
Kuhlmann and Dabricius.
" The principal offshoots of the Anabaptist fanaticism in
Germany, Holland, and Switzerland, were the Adamites, the
Apostolics, the Taciturn, the Perfect, the Impeccable, the
Liberated Brethren, the Sabbatarians, the Clancularians, the
Manifestarians, the Bewailers, the Rejoicers, the Indifferent,
the Sanguinarians, the Antimariens. " 3

GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND
(Founded 1717)

John Valentin Andrea, the Rosicrucian, having elaborated
a plan to merge all the existing religious Societies into one
organization, published in 1614 a book Universal and
General Reformation of the Whole Wide World, in which he
advocated the foundation of a secret society of all classes,
pledged to work quietly for the benefit of their fellows.
To this period also belongs the legend of Christian
Rosenkreutz (see page 151).
Andrea, however, failed in his endeavours but Jan Amos
Komensky (Comenius) joined actively in his efforts and, as
early as 1628, begged leave to share in this work of which he
presently was given sole charge.
About this time, Comenius wrote his renowned work on
All-wisdom, the Pansophia, which embodied his ideas on the
foundation of humanity's Utopia.
This Moravian school-master, Comenius, while doubtless
an idealist, was also interested in spiritism, prophecies,
revolution, Antichrist, the Millenium and such like whims of
a dangerous fanaticism. He collected the visions of the
Anabaptists, Kotterus and those of Dab-ricius and published
them at Amsterdam. Those visions
174

GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND

175

promised such wonders as the extermination of the Pope, the
House of Austria, Gustavus Adolphus, Gus-tavus, King of
Sweden, Cromwell and others and were of a most disturbing
character. 1
When Anderson undertook the task of uniting the old
traditions of practical Masonry with the more recent
development and broadened ideas of the new world-league,
he incorporated in his book of constitution a reproduction of
the main part of the plans and ideas of Comenius. Their true
meaning was faithfully adhered to, and important and
decisive passages were adopted almost literally.
The transformation of the Lodge was actually carried out
in 1663 when, in the General Assembly of Masons, the
masters of operative masonry, feeling themselves supplanted
and overruled, realized that if they did not wish to forsake
their Lodge they must unite with its new masters and
subordinate themselves to their designs — Henry Jermyn,
Lord St. Albans, was elected and installed Grand Master, Sir
John Denham became his deputy and Sir Christopher Wren
and John Webb, wardens.
The English Grand Lodge, as we know it, was founded on
June 24, 1717, by Anderson, Desaguliers (an expatriated
Frenchman said to have been the head of the Rose Croix),
Calvert, James King, Elliot, Lumden Madden and George
Payne.2 It works only the first three degrees, Apprentice,
Fellow-Craft and Master Mason (Blue Masonry) and
constitutes the nursery for the selection of initiates for the
higher or so called " spurious " masonry. Masons desirous of
rising in the

ranks of the Fraternity are therefore obliged to enter Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rites, (in England Ancient and
Accepted Rites) Grand Orient, Memphis and Mizraim,
Swedenborg or some other International order which works
the higher grades and selects its members from graduates of
the original English system.
English masonry claims to be a purely charitable
institution.
It is Blue Masonry which answers to the lesser mysteries
of the ancients wherein, in reality, nothing but the exoteric
doctrines were revealed, whilst spurious masonry, or all
subsequent degrees (for no one can be initiated into them who
has not passed through the first three degrees) answer to the
greater Mysteries. 3
" According to Anderson's own showing", stater,
Freemasonry Universal, " previous to the formation of Grand
Lodge in 1717 the ceremonies of the Freemasons were purely
Christian, but soon after that important change it was decided
to widen the basis of the Craft so that men of all religious
persuasions could enter her portals and benefit by her
teaching. " 4
On page 303 of The Rosicrucian and Masonic Record can
be found the " Articles of Union ", dated 1813, of the two
Fraternities of Free and Accepted Masons of England ; the "
Society of Free and Accepted Masons " and " The Grand
Lodge of the Society of Freemasons ". At the same time,
Grand Lodge agreed to recognize a fourth degree, that of
Holy Royal Arch.
In these articles it is specified that the representation of a
Lodge in Grand Lodge shall be by its

actual Master, Wardens and one Past master only. Prior to the
revival in 1717, and the reconstruction of Masonry in its
present symbolic form we find in another article in The
Rosicrucian and Masonic Record (page 167) that :
" Very little is known of the proceedings of Masonic bodies,
from the fact that very few written documents were permitted
to be recorded, and of these few, owing to the jealousy or
over-caution of their rulers, many were burnt in London in
1721. "
We can accept the causes given above for the destruction
of these documents with a smile!
On initiation, Masons receive an alias by which name they
are henceforth known in the Lodge.
All Masonry is founded on the usual system of sectarian
help. " Help a Mason " supplants the Christian teaching of "
Help everyone ".
Until the last few years this rule had not assumed a
subversive character. Lately however, it is said that " to get
anywhere in business in the City (London) one must be a
Mason ". This has stimulated Masonic recruiting, implying as
it does a virtual business boycott against non-masons. Each
new recruit weakens the forces of those whose free,
unhampered judgment could serve the cause of real liberty,
democracy, and humanity.
Masonry, English and Continental, has been very useful to
persons with political ambitions and minor mental and moral
capacities.

" The Temple, being emblematic of the human body, the
Master's Lodge is known as the Middle Chamber within
which the most intimate mysteries of Freemasonry are
celebrated. It represents the Uterus wherein is accomplished

" The acacia, the initiatic emblem of the Gauls and
Scandinavians, and the fig tree, the initiatic emblem of the
Syrians and the Orientals, signify that all the mysteries are
derived from one source and rest on one base, that of India.
" The Phallus is used by the Freemasons in the degree of
Master where it is designated by the word Mahabone.
" This fecundation is supposed to take place as follows :
" In the early period of initiation the seed of the unfertilized
grain is dead. The Candidate, bearing within him this inert
seed, is a male as he only wears upon his breast the Compass
emblem of the membrum virile. He is stretched upon a
mattress, or in a coffin or ditch, emblematic of the bed of the
Pastos or the mysteries of generation.11
" Neither the second, nor the first warden can endow him
with life. Alone, the Worshipful Master, wearing upon his
chest the Square, symbol of the genitalia mulieris
representing the female, (the Lodge) can fertilize this seed by
leaning over the Candidate, who, representing the male,
unites with him by the five points of perfection n.
" The seed is fertilized by the Union of the male and the
female, and the Lodge becomes pregnant of the Candidate,
which she brings into the world nine months

later, as Perfect Master, fourth degree, it being established
that nine full months must have passed since the aspirant had
received the degree of Master Mason. " 13
In summing up : — The basis on which are founded the
first three degrees of practical masonry are : —
" That the Apprentice, Bohaz, the personification of Osiris
or of Bacchus, coming to search for Truth in the Lodge, finds
that he is a Male-God and incomplete for the generation of
beings. 14
" That the Companion Jackin, personification of Isis or
Venus, the Female-God, completes the Male-God by
rendering possible the generation of beings. 15
" That the Master Mahabone or MacBenac is the
Hermaphrodite, complete son of Loth and his daughter, son
of the sun and the earth.
" And that because :
1. All originates by Generation, and not by Creation,
which is only the simple induction of Generation.
2. Corruption or destruction follows generation in all its
works.
3. Regeneration restores, under other forms, the effects
of destruction.
" The formula of the three first degrees of Freemasonry is
therefore :
" The Incomplete man, the Profane, by initiation in

Freemasonry, becomes Bohaz and is completed by Jackin in
the Lodge which restores his corrupted divinity in Mahabone
".
The special masonic significance of the Flamboyant Star,
or Seal of Solomon, in Masonry $> is essentially the creative
element.
Man reclining presents a protuberance in the middle.
Woman reclining, on the contrary, presents a cavity in the
middle.
The two enlaced form the Flamboyant Star.
Small wonder that Mackey states that " no eunuch can be
initiated a mason ! " 16
Unfortunately, many corrupt and vicious persons seek
Masonic protection and it is to the interest of all such
aspirants to power thus to encourage vice and corruption
through blackmail, using their votaries in the sect to further
their own private ends. This is the fundamental danger
inherent in all secret societies, whatever their reputation,
where Power is the object.
" A Mason is said to demit from the order when he
withdraws from all connection with it. It relieves the
individual from pecuniary contributions and debars him from
pecuniary relief, but it does not cancel his Masonic
obligations, nor exempt him from that wholesome control
which the order exercises over the moral conduct of its
members. In this respect the Mason is once a Mason and
always a Mason. " 17
' The fact that a Mason not a member of any particular
lodge, but who has been guilty of immoral or unmasonic
conduct, can be tried and punished by

Quoting Brother Moore (from Moore's Magazine, vol. 1, p.

Lodge of Master Masons whether he be a member or
otherwise. This obligation on the part of an individual clearly
implies a power in the lodge to investigate and control his
conduct in all things which concern the interest of the
Institution. "

'HE GOSPEL OF REVOLUTION

Apart from the Rosicrucians already mentioned, we see the
foundation and growth of such societies as :
1. The Strict Observance of the Baron Hund and the notorious
Jew Leucht who had assumed the name of Johnson, and several
other aliases. It recruited its members in the Lodges and went from
occultism into political intrigue, later even formulating a plan of
economic and financial rule.
2. The Martinists, which, founded by a Portuguese Mar-rano
Jew, Martinez Depasqualy, united political intrigues, fomented for
the overthrow of the monarchy, together with magical practices. It
numbered among its members the chief politicians who prepared
the French Revolution. These were Savalette de Lange, William
Law and Mirabeau.
3. The Scottish Rite.
4. The Moravian Brothers.
5. The Alta Vendita.
6. The Egyptian Rites of Cagliostro (Mizraim).
The adepts of all these different rites knew but little beyond the
fact that they had shaken off the yoke of Christian principles which
were replaced by the cult of nature, and in almost all cases
licentiousness. They 'Were but mere puppets manipulated by
unseen men
183

184

OCCULT THEOCRASY

whose sinister aims were the destruction of Christianity and
disruption of States and to whom all the above named orders
or organizations were but so many recruiting grounds. It was
only when each and all had gathered sufficient strength that
the " Invisible Masters " attempted to unite them all under
one supreme sway, namely that of Illuminism at the Convent
of Wilhelms-badin 1782.
Illuminism represented the efforts of the heads of the
powerful Jewish Kahal which has ever striven for the
attainment of political financial, economic and moral world
dominion. The movement had been founded in 1776 by
Adam Weishaupt. Bernard Lazare, himself a Jew, has written
that " There were Jews behind Weishaupt ", and upon a close
study of Illuminism, we find that the destructive forces which
culminated in the French Revolution were of three kinds ;
financial, intellectual and anti-christian.
In the first class, we come upon the names of Jewish
Financiers such as : — Daniel Itzig, Friedlander, Ceerf-beer,
Benjamin and Abraham Goldsmid, Moses Mocatta, Veitel
Heine Ephraim.
In the second category, we find Moses Mendelssohn,
Naphtali Wessely, Moses Hersheim — who are the inspirers
of Lessing — Frederic Nicolai, Weishaupt, Mirabeau, lAbbe
Gregoire, the Duke of Brunswick-WolfenbutteL and
Anacharsis Clootz.
Lastly, the third class is composed mostly of the group
known as the Encyclopedists : dAlembert, Diderot, Rousseau,
Voltaire and of all the Cabalists practising magic and among
whom we find : Martinez Depas-qualy, Leucht, the enigmatic
Count of Saint Germain, Falke and Joseph Balsamo
surnamed Cagliostro.
The objects of this powerful organization of the Bavarian
Illuminati, were :

THE

GOSPEL OF REVOLUTION

185

1. The destruction of Christianity and of all Monarchical
Governments ;
2. The destruction of nations as such in favour of universal
internationalism ;
3. The discouragement of patriotic and loyal effort branded as narrow minded prejudice, incompatible with the tenets
of goodwill to all men and the cry of " Universal Brotherhood
";
4. The abolition of family ties and of marriage by means of
systematic corruption ;
5. The suppression of the rights of inheritance and property.
Moses Mendelssohn, himself the head of the Haskalah,
(Jewish Illuminati) cooperated with the Bavarian Illu-minati
of Weishaupt and with the prominent members of the other
revolutionary secret societies aspiring to political power, but,
in 1784, the Elector of Bavaria made an abortive effort to
stamp out the conspiracy which, being international, was
necessarily impervious to local measures. The poison of
subversion was working in France where on January 21, 1793,
it culminated in the death on the scaffold of Louis XVI, an
event that in masonic jargon is known as " The second cannon shot ". The capture of Rome by Cadorna in 1870 was the
third.
As a further confirmation of concerted masonic action let
us bring yet another illustration :
In the first days of the French Revolution (1848), 300
Freemasons, with their banners flying over brethren of every
rite representing French Freemasonry, marched to the Hotel
de Ville, and there offered their banner to the Provisional
Government of the Republic, proclaiming aloud the part they
had just taken in the glorious Revolution.
M. de Lamartine made them this answer, which was

186

OCCULT THEOCRASY

received with enthusiasm by the Freemasonry Lodges: " It is
from the depths of your lodges that the ideas have emanated,
first in the dark, then in the twilight, and now in the full light
of day, which have laid the foundations of the Revolutions of
1789, 1830, and 1849. " 1
Fourteen days later, a new deputation of the " Grand Orient
", adorned with their Masonic scarfs and jewels, repaired to
the Hotel de Ville. They were received by A. Cremieux 2, and
Gamier Pages, attended by pages, who also wore their
Masonic emblems. The Representative of the Grand Master
spoke thus : — " French Freemasonry cannot contain her
universal burst of sympathy with the great social and national
movement which has just been effected. The Freemasons hail
with joy the triumph of their principles, and boast of being
able to say that the whole country has received through you a
Masonic consecration. Forty thousand Freemasons in 500
lodges, forming but one heart and one soul, assure you here of
their support happily to lead to the end the work of
regeneration so gloriously begun ". Brother Cremieux, a
Jewish brother, member of the Provisional Government,
replied : " Citizens and brothers of the Grand Orient, the
Provisional Government accepts with pleasure your useful
and complete adhesion. The Republic exists in Freemasonry.
If the Republic do as the Freemasons have done, it will
become the glowing pledge of union with all men, in all parts
of the globe, and on all sides of our triangle. "3

GOSPEL OF REVOLUTION

If the wielding of power and their national political
economic and financial strength over the peoples by a few
hidden hands can result in such calamitous upheavals as the
French Revolution, the World War of 1914 and the Russian
Revolution of 1917, were it not wise to apply the lesson of
experience to ascertain whether the supposed harmless
Masonry of today does not again serve as a screen or curtain
behind which thrive secret societies no less subversive,
revolutionary and demoralising than those which we have
just so briefly sketched ?
We know that most of them such as the Martinists, the
Illuminatis, the Scottish Rite and the Egyptian Lodges of
Memphis and Mizraim still exist today, so, on what grounds
can we base our assumption of a change of their revolutionary
and anti-christian principles? In the face of late events,
namely, the Peace Conference, the creation of the League of
Nations, the amalgamation of international resources, the
confiscatory inheritance taxes, the development of
international finance, the proposed establishment of an
international non-christian cult, have we the right to refrain
from lifting the veil of Masonry behind which subversive
movements are so conveniently hidden?

It is necessary to give a brief review of the history of Ancient and

Scottish of Perfection or of Heredom, in twenty-five degrees,
worked in the eighteenth century in Europe by Masons devoting
themselves to occultism. The following statement with
188

THE

PREPARATION

189

regard to the introduction of this rite in America is made in a
report by Albert Pike :
" We can soon learn how it was that the Council degrees
came, about 1766, from France, and not from Prussia. In
1761, the Lodges and Councils of the superior degrees being
extended throughout Europe, Frederic II (Frederic the Great),
King of Prussia, as Grand Commander of the, Order of
Princes of the Royal Secret, or 32 degrees, was by general
consent acknowledged and recognized as Sovereign and
Supreme Head of the Scotch Rite. " 1
" On the 25th Oct. 1762, the Grand Masonic Constitutions
were finally ratified in Berlin and proclaimed for the
government of all Masonic bodies working in the Scotch Rite
over the two hemispheres; and in the same year they were
transmitted to the Jew, Stephen Morin, who had been
appointed, at the request of Lacorne, in August, 1761,
Inspector General for the New World by the Grand
Consistory of Princes of the Royal Secret, convened at Paris,
under the presidency of Chaillon de Joinville, representative
of Frederic (the Great) and Substitute General of the Order. 2
It will be remembered that the 33rd degree was not then
created; and under Frederic the Great, there was no rank
higher than the 32nd degree nor anybody superior to a
Consistory. " 3

Morin went to Santo Domingo where he was joined by Moses M.
Hays and Henry Andrew Francken. The latter founded a branch of
the rite in Jamaica, while to the former was entrusted the task of
founding lodges in North America. The Jew Hays established a
Sublime Lodge of Perfection in Boston, of which he constituted
himself Grand Master and charged one of his co-reli-gionscs, and
brother Mason, Isaac Dacosta, who, in 1758 had founded the St.
Andrew Lodge in Boston, with the mission of introducing Masonry
into South Carolina.
Though on August 27, in 1766, Bro. Morin's patent was revoked
by the Grand Body in Paris for " propagating strange and monstrous
doctrines " exercising bad faith etc., etc. 4, and given to Bro. Martin,
Morin continued constituting chapters and councils and, with
Sovereign Grand Inspector General, The 33rd and ultimate
degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. It is not known
when or where this grade originated. The theory which ascribes it to
the King of Prussia has long since been discarded by intelligent
Masons. The number of Inspectors in a kingdom or republic must
not exceed nine. These, organized in a body, constitute the Supreme
Council, which claims jurisdiction over all the Ineffable and
Sublime degrees. The presiding officer is styled Sovereign Grand
Commander.

of fifty-nine years before the war, (American Civil War) to hide
treason. But slavery then ruled the country, and this 33rd Charleston
degree ruled the lodge. And the Southern lodge-rooms worked up
the most unjustifiable and infamous war on record. The Southern
people "were dragooned into it, by leaders secretly sworn to obey
Masonic leaders, or have their throats cut. "

Dacosta, in 1783, seventeen years after his patent had been
annulled, he erected in Charleston " The Grand Lodge of
Perfection ".
Dacosta was its Grand Master. Joseph M. Meyers was his
eventual successor, and " when the Grand Council of Princes
of Jerusalem was established in Charleston, February 20,
1788, he, as one of the Deputy-Inspectors who established it,
deposited in the archives certified copies of the degree of
Royal and Select Masters from guidance and government of
that new body. " 5
The two Masonic powers of Boston and Charleston
created numerous lodges and inner shrines in the United
States and gave themselves the title of Mother Lodges of the
United States.
In view of the historical fact that the American War of
Independence broke out in 1773, it is interesting to find that
the Lodge of Perfection, at Albany (New-York), was directed
as early as 1770 to transmit reports to Berlin. 6 This indeed
becomes significant when considered with the circumstances
surrounding the " Boston Tea Party ", which are so ably
described in The History of Freemasonry and Concordant
Orders by Stillson and Hughan, that we take the liberty of
here transcribing some lines from this remarkable
publication : 7
" Grand Master (Joseph) Warren was appointed on March
3, 1772, by the Grand Master of Scotland, Grand Master of

leading Masons made it the headquarters of the Revolution.
On November 30, 1773, the Lodge of St. Andrew's (that
founded by Dacosta and of which Warren was a member) was
closed without the transaction of any business, in
consequence of the fewness of the brethren present, the
consignees of tea having broken up the brethren's nerve. On
the 16th of December following, it is said the line of march
was taken from the lodge-room to destroy the tea on the then
arriving ships.
" On April 8, 1776, the Grand Lodge was convened for the
performance of a sad and solemn duty, that of attending the
funeral of Grand Master Warren, who was killed at Bunker
Hill. "
In 1738, Pope Clement XII had excommunicated the
Freemasons.
We extract the following instructive points from Adriano
Lemmi by Margiotta : 8
" Sovereign Princes of Jerusalem was the title born by the
deputies of the Grand Master when they received missions to
found lodges and visit regions where they had high
jurisdiction. The name was that of a function and not a degree
of initiation and there was one deputy only for each region.
On May 15, 1781, at a convention of Deputy Inspectors
convoked by Hays and Meyers at Philadelphia, Moses Cohen
was named deputy inspector of Jamaica, as Francken,
originally appointed by Stephen Morin to found lodges there,
had neglected his mandate. Soon another Jewish Freemason
came to Jamaica. This was Hyman Isaac Long who derived
his powers from Morin, through Francken, Hays, Spitzer
8. Margiotta, op. cit, p. 86 et seq.
Isaac Long was the son of Isaac Long, a Dutch writer, one
of the foremost Moravian brethren, and closely connected with

and Moses Cohen, and who was to play a great role in the
sect.
" The convention of Philadelphia had decided that, in the
future, there might be several Sovereign Princes of Jerusalem
per region. By virtue of this decision, Moses Cohen conferred
this title on Isaac Long who, finding his sphere of action too
restricted at Jamaica soon went to Charleston. He was an
active man who had formed great plans. Not only did he
create other Lodges, but he brought other rites (such as that of
Royal Arch) under the obedience of the Mother Lodge at
Charleston. The Mother Lodge at Boston however did not
prosper.
" Nevertheless, when one thinks of the immense territory
of the United States, one understands that the Lodges, at the
start, could only be very few and far between, so masonry
vegetated for a long time in North America. In 1795, Isaac
Long went to Europe, leaving Colonel John Mitchell the
direction of the Mother Lodge of Charleston.
" When he returned to the United States, six years later, he
brought the plan of his great idea, which was the creation of a
rite of 33 degrees destined to become universal. With Colonel
John Mitchell, Doctor Frederic Dalcho, Abraham Alexander,
Isaac Auld and Emanuel de la Motta, all Sovereign Princes of
Jerusalem, he constituted this rite, taking twenty-five degrees
of the system of Heredom, six Templar grades in which were
merged four degrees borrowed from the German Illu-minism9
of Adam Weishaupt, and two grades called grades of
administration, the last of which supplanted the function of
Deputy Inspector (Sovereign Prince of Jerusalem) and took
the title of Sovereign Grand Inspector General 33rd and last
degree. This was his

crowning achievement. Isaac Long gave the institution the
name of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites, and the first
great constitutions were signed at Charleston, on May 31st
1801. "
It was Isaac Long who created de Grasse and his
father-in-law, de la Hogue, Deputy Grand Inspectors
General.
" In order to insure great popularity for the rite, he linked it
directly with the Templars by a mysterious legend. The high
grades of other rites had already thought of pretending to
avenge the Templars, condemned in the Middle Ages by the
Papacy and the Monarchy. In the ceremonial of certain
initiations, a pretext was thus contrived for swearing hatred
and death to royalty and the church.
But Isaac Long had found better than that.
According to the tradition, the Knights Templar, convicted
of secret conspiracy and maleficent occultism, had taken
refuge in Scotland where they succeeded in eluding their
pursuers. It was said that they had succeeded in buying the
head of the Grand Master Jacques Bourgignon de Molay from
the executioner, after it had been severed from the body and
that they had contrived to place in safety the monstrous idol
called Baphomet which they worshipped in their secret
assemblies.
When Long arrived in Charleston in 1801, he brought with
him this Baphomet which he claimed to have recovered as
well as a skull which he declared to be that of the Grand
Master Molay. They were signal relics, holy things! Long
affirmed that he had been assured by the Good God in person
that victory over the Church was contingent on these precious
relics, and that the Templar Baphomet was the Palladium
which would lead Freemasonry to victory ".

THE

195

To this other authors have added that this skull is known as
the relic of Saint Jacques and is placed upon a high pedestal
in the Hall of the Supreme Council of Scottish Rites, in the
temple at Charleston, where annually, on the 11th of March,
it talks and vomits flames.
Its conversational propensities were however not revealed
until Gallatin Mackey, who claimed to be the reincarnation of
Jacques de Molay, developed the proclivity for going into an
annual trance on the 11th of March. This trance lasted about
one hour, during which the skull conversed volubly about
itself and all sorts of other things."
Pursuing the subject further, Margiotta states that:
" The Mother Lodge of Boston had ceased functioning for
some years but that of Charleston, reconstituted according to
the new Scottish System in 33 degrees, became the root of the
tree which was to spread its branches over the entire world.
The Superior Lodge of the Grand Sovereign Inspectors
General, in each country, was to be called the Supreme
Council, and it is from the Supreme Council of Charleston
that all the others were to emanate. It is thus the first Supreme
Council of the Globe.
" Such is the history of the origin of this rite which attracted
Mazzini's attention for, during the years which preceded the
taking of Rome by the army of Piedmont, he could see that
the previsions of Isaac Long had been realized. So it was in
Pike, the successor of Long, himself the Sovereign
Commander Grand Master, that the great revolutionary
conspirator sought an ally in his work the object of which was
the total destruction of the church. " 10

The following address, n issued from Paris by Giuseppe
Mazzini12 to his friends in Italy, October 1846, fully sets forth the
deep laid plans by which Freemasonry sought to engage all classes.
" In great countries, it is by the people we must go to
regeneration ; in yours, by the princes. We must absolutely make
them of our side. It is easy. The Pope will march in reform through
principle and of necessity ; the King of Piedmont through the idea of
the crown of Italy; the Grand Duke of Tuscany through inclination
and irritation ; the King of Naples through force ; and the little
princes will have to think of other things besides reform. The people
yet in servitude can only sing its wants. Profit by the least
concession to assemble the masses, were it only to testify
gratitude.... Fetes, songs, assemblies, numerous relations
established among men of all opinions, suffice to make ideas gush
out, to give the people a feeling of its strength and render it
exacting... Italy is still what France was before the Revolution ; she
wants, then, Mirabeau, Lafayette, and others. A great lord may be
held back by his material interests, but he may be taken by vanity.
Leave him the chief place whilst he will go with you. There are few
who would go to the end.
" The essential thing is, that the goal of the great revolution be
unknown to them ; let us never permit them to see more than the
first step. In Italy, the clergy are rich in money and the faith of the
people. You must

make their influence of use.
" Learned discussions are neither necessary nor opportune.
There are regenerative words which contain all that need be
often repeated to the people. Liberty, rights of man, progress,
equality, fraternity, are what the people will understand
above all when opposed to the words, despotism, privileges,
tyranny, etc., etc.
" Nearly two thousand years ago, a great philosopher,
called Christ, preached the fraternity which the world yet
seeks. Accept, then, all the help offered you. Whoever will
make one step towards you must be yours till he quits you. A
king gives a more liberal law ; applaud him, and ask for the
one that must follow. A minister shows intention of progress ;
give him out as a model. A lord affects to pout at his
privileges ; put yourself under his direction if he will stop,
you will have time to let him go : he will remain isolated, and
without strength against you, and you will have a thousand
ways to make unpopular all who oppose your projects. All
personal discontent, all deceptions, all bruised ambition, may
serve the cause of progress by giving them a. new direction.
The army is the greatest enemy to the progress of socialism.
It must be paralysed by the education of the people. Clerical
power is personified in the Jesuits. The odium of that name is

Do not fear to see them split: the more the better. All go to the
same end by different ways. The secret will be often violated ;
so much the better ; the secret is necessary to give security to
the members, but a certain transparency is needed to inspire
fire to the stationary.

That Freemasonry has not always enjoyed immunity the
following quotation will serve to show.
" In the year 1735, the States General of Holland
proscribed the secret Masonic League, and the French
government imitated the example in 1735. In 1757, in
Scotland, the Synod of Stirling adopted a resolution debarring
all adhering Freemasons from the ordinances of religion.
" The Great Council of Berne proscribed Freemasonry in
1748, Bavaria followed in 1799, and its total suppression took
place in 1845, The Regency of Milan and the Governor of
Venice acted in a similar manner by it in 1814. John VI, King
of Portugal, prohibited Freemasonry in the strictest manner in
1816, and renewed it in 1824. In 1820 several lodges were
closed in Prussia for political intrigues ; and in the same year
Alexander I banished the order from the whole Russian
Empire. A similar occurrence took place four years later in
Modena and Spain... Yet today, some men boast of belonging
to a secret society, the members of which were declared, by
an Act of George III, felons, and liable to transportation for
life ! " 13
Speaking of Masons, in 1876, Richard Carlile wrote : " Let
them not wait to be disbanded by the Legislature, as a useless
and mischievous association : but let them anticipate the spirit
of a coming age... The deluge of mystery has not only
overwhelmed Babylon but Egypt, Greece, Rome, and will, if
we do not light up the spirit of revelation in time, most
assuredly overthrow this British nation. It is even now in
danger, from the dissension of its internal mysteries, of
becoming an easy prey to some more barbarously mysterious
power. Thus fell Babylon, Egypt, Jerusalem, Greece,

"Rome, and why not Britain, if Britain retain those seeds of

bands. " 14
This warning however passed unheeded. During the time
that has elapsed between the publication of Car-lile's book
and the present day, we see England honeycombed with
societies, subversive of law, order and morals.
Numerous are the homes which have become resorts where,
today, the shameful orgies of Medmenham are enacted anew.
They are the secret haunts of social cliques and associations,
and behind such screens as art, antiques and dressmaking
thrive, as though they were highly protected, the white slave
traffic, the dope traffic and gambling which serve as a

GENERAL PEPE AND THE " ONE
BIG UNION "

At the present moment, when we are surfeited with the
words unions and mergers, to say nothing of cartels, a new
interest is awakened by the perusal of Thomas Frost's book on
Secret Societies, from which we extract the following :
" Two results of great importance in the progress of the
European revolution proceeded from the events that occurred
at Naples in 1820-21. One was the reorganization of the
Carbonari, consequent upon the publicity given to the system
when it had brought about the revolution, and the secrecy in
which it had hitherto been enveloped was no longer deemed
necessary ; the other was the extension of the system beyond
the Alps. When the Neapolitan revolution had been effected,
the Carbonari emerged from their mystery, published their
constitution and statutes, and ceased to conceal their patents
and their cards of membership. In the Papal States, in
Lombardy, and in Piedmont, the veil of secrecy was
maintained for a little time longer, partly through the
adoption by the Carbonari in those portions of the peninsula
of symbols and pass-words different from those of the
Neapolitan lodges, partly by the for200

201

mation of the various societies of the Adelphi, the Guelphs,
the Brother Protectors, and the Italian Fede-rati, which were
similar, and yet not the same, though all holding the same
principles, and having a common object. But after the
collapse of the Piedmontese revolution, so much doubt and
fear existed among the leaders as to the extent to which the
secrets of the system were known that they were all effaced,
and consigned to oblivion. The scattered directors of the
movement drew together the broken threads of the
conspiracy as soon as they were able, but with a new
nomenclature and a new symbolism. 1
" The dispersion of the Carbonaro leaders had, at the same
time, the effect of extending the system in France, where it
had been introduced towards the end of 1820 and creating
centres of revolutionary agitation in the foreign cities in
which they temporarily located themselves.
General Pepe proceeded to Barcelona when the
counter-revolution was imminent at Naples, and his life was
no longer safe there ; and to the same city went several of the
Piedmontese revolutionists when their country was
Austrianized after the same lawless fashion.
Scalvini and Ugoni took refuge at Geneva ; others of the
proscribed proceeded to London. This dispersion, and the
progress which Carbonarism was making in France,
suggested to General Pepe the idea of an international secret
society, which should combine for a common purpose the
advanced political reformers of all the European States.
Shortly after his arrival at Madrid, to which city he
proceeded from Barcelona, he propounded to two or
1. Thomas Frost, Secret Societies of the European Revolution,

three ultra-Liberal deputies the plan of this society, the object
of which, he says,
' was to enable the members to correspond and by these
means preclude the possibility of a renewal of that want of
union which had been experienced amongst the most noted
patriots of Spain and Portugal, Naples and Piedmont. Several
deputies of the Cortes were inclined to regard such an
association as extremely beneficial to the public cause, more
especially in their own peninsula, where a great want of
concord existed between the Portuguese and the Spaniards.
The society was accordingly founded; several members of the
Cortes formed part of it, as well as General Ballesteros,
Councillor of State. I still preserve the regulations of this
society, the great object of which was to open a communication
between the most enlightened patriots of the different cities in
Europe. It was decided that I should exert myself to give it
extension in Lisbon, London and Paris ; and that, in the event
of my success, other members should proceed to propagate it
over Italy and Germany. '
" Having organized in Madrid the first circle of the
Constitutional Society of European Patriots, Pepe proceeded
to Lisbon, where he was even more successful in his efforts
than in the Spanish capital. Two of the Ministers, and several
Councillors of State and members of the Cortes signified their
adhesion, and, before Pepe left, a flourishing circle was
formed, under the direction of Almeida-Moraes, the president
of the Cortes. From Lisbon the general proceeded by sea to
London, where, as he says, he soon found that 'a secret society
in England among men of mind is a thing quite out of the
order of probability '. He mentioned the society to a few, but
met with no encouragement. The Duke of Sussex and Sir
Robert "Wilson read the statutes and regulations of the
society, but only as a matter of curiosity. "

GENERAL PEPE AND THE

"

ONE BIG UNION '

203

This curiosity is doubtless responsible for the creation of
what was later known as The International Committee of
London. The particular Duke of Sussex, here referred to was
Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England from
1813-1843, and this interview with the Italian revolutionary
is of great significance showing as it does the effort, at this
date, to subvert English Freemasonry to the aims of The
International. According to the system which worked out
later, English Freemasonry retained, to all appearances, its
original autonomy.
But to proceed with the statement of Frost :
" Pepe next opened a correspondence with Lafayette, who
hailed the proposed international organization of the secret
societies as ' a Holy Alliance opposed to that of despotism, '
and at once associated himself with it. He, with Manuel and
Argenson, the triumvirate that was supposed to have directed
the Associated Patriots of 1816, were earnestly engaged at
that time in the reorganisation of the Carbonari of France,
upon a new system, which promised more perfect
impenetrability ; and Buonarotti was similarly engaged at
Geneva, with a view to renewed operations in Italy. "
" It has been doubted whether Lafayette, Manuel2, and
Argenson3, with others who were supposed to be the leaders
of the Carbonari in France, were actually the chiefs of the
society; and, with regard to Manuel at least, the point is not
susceptible of positive demonstration. There are, in all
countries, men of superior station who, when a collision
between the people and the Government is impending, are
aware of what is going on, and hold themselves prepared to
step to the front when the movement has advanced to a

at which they can do so with advantage to the cause and safety
to themselves ; but who take care not to commit themselves to
it prematurely, or to allow any trace to exist of their
connexion with it. This has been thought by some to have
been the real position of the individuals whom others have
asserted to have been the actual leaders of the Carbonari, as
they had previously been held to be of the Associated Patriots ;
but though there is no absolute proof that they were the Grand
Elect there can be very little, if any, moral doubt upon the
point. "
The Author of Secret Societies of the European Revolution
writes the foregoing paragraph but fails to explain it.
Who and what are the men he refers to ?
Such indeed are the political principles adopted by the
leaders of Freemasonry. Therein lies its power. As soon as
any political movement becomes inevitable, as soon as public
pressure on an existing government becomes too strong, this
sect, in the name of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, takes the
secret leadership of the opposing faction. Through the new
government which becomes the subservient tool of its
capricious master, who, at any moment, may suppress its
fledgling, by creating and backing a new opposition, it holds,
not the balance of power but all the power.
Thus : Those who rule Freemasonry today, rule the world.
And Frost further adds :
"In 1831, the French Government had not only proclaimed
a policy of non-intervention, but had expressly declared that
France would not permit intervention on the part of any other
Power in the affairs of any nation in Europe. Lafayette was
deceived by these professions, and assured Misley (the agent
of the Masonic Revolutionary Committee) that the Italians
had nothing to fear. "

GENERAL PEPE AND THE " ONE BIG UNION "

205

In that year Masonry made an attempt to cast off the
Austrian yoke in Italy by using France as its base of
operations. Owing however to French non-cooperation the
revolution failed.
" A few days afterwards, Misley and Linati arrived at
Marseilles and chartered a vessel, aboard which they put a
couple of cannon and twelve hundred muskets. They were
joined by General Pepe, Count Grilenzoni, the advocate
Mantovani, Dr. Franceschini, and Lieutenant Mori; but, at the
last moment, the Prefect received a telegraphic order from
Paris to prevent their embarkation and lay an embargo on the
vessel. General Pepe evaded the vigilance of the police,
however, and contrived to reach Hyeres, where he heard of
the entrance of the Austrians into Bologna, and thereupon
abandoned his intention of giving the aid of his reputation and
experience to the revolutionary cause. "
In connexion with the agitation provoked in Piedmont,
during the reign of Charles Albert, by Mazzini's " Young
Italy " movement in 1848, the veteran General Pepe again
comes into prominence. On March 29, 1848, he arrived at
Naples, and was sent for by King Ferdinand who invited him
" to form a Ministry, of which he should have the Presidency,
with the Ministries of War and Marine. " Every difficulty
however was thrown in the way of Pepe's projected military
operations, " the Naval Department insisting that the fleet
could not convey troops, the King interposing various delays
and the Pope refusing permission for more than one battalion
or squadron to pass daily. Seventeen thousand troops at last
started, but with orders not to cross the Po until the King
commanded the passage ! "4

There was much marching and countermarching but the

The tangled history of the " Young Italy " movement in its
early stages is well explained by Thomas Frost in Secret
Societies of the European Revolution, and anyone particularly
interested in that phase of political history would do well to
refer to this book. Due allowance must however be made for
certain omissions and inaccurate deductions on the part of the
author who, in 1876, could not have access to information
which is now available to anyone seeking it.

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the organization of a supreme rite, introduced into
Freemasonry, to lend a satanic character to the vague divinity
more or less well known by the name of " The Great
Architect of the Universe ".
During the last years preceding the capture of Rome,
Mazzini had established relations with the Masonic chief of
Scottish Rites, Albert Pike, President of the Supreme Council
of Charleston, United States.
Pike was a great student of the Cabala and the occult.
Mazzini had understood that Freemasonry was a powerful
lever with which to revolutionize the world, but he saw it
divided into numerous rites, often rivals, and even hostile to
one another. Aspiring to Italian Unity as a means of breaking
the temporal power of the Holy See, he dreamt of a union of
masonry throughout the world to destroy the church itself as a
spiritual power.
He addressed himself to Pike in preference to another
Grand Orient or Supreme Council chief because of the many
international ramifications of Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rites, as Pike, its recognised chief, had succeeded in gaining
considerable influence over all the Supreme National
Councils of this rite which had hitherto been of a purely
dogmatic and liturgic character.
Mazzini, who was very practical, said that it would be
inadvisable to favour one rite only to the exclusion of all the
others. In a letter to Albert Pike, dated Jan. 22, 1870, he writes.
" We must allow all the federations to continue just as they
are, with their systems, their central authorities and their
divers modes of correspondence between high grades of the
same rite, organized as they are at present, but we must create
a supreme rite, which will remain unknown, to which

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

we will call those Masons of high degree whom we shall
select. With regard to their brothers in masonry, these men
must be pledged to the strictest secrecy. Through this
supreme rite, we will govern all Freemasonry which will
become the one international centre, the more powerful
because its direction will be unknown. "
Thus at the time when Mazzini formed the scheme of
unifying Freemasonry by creating one central universal
direction reserved to a small number of high masons chosen
with the greatest care, he selected Albert Pike as an ally.
Pike was born in Boston on Dec. 29, 1809.
His parents, in modest circumstances, succeeded in giving
him a course at Harvard College. He then went to join his
family at Newbury port. There, for a while, he taught in a
primary school till he moved to Fair-haven where he
continued his career of pedagogue.
In 1833 he went to Little Rock.
From 1830 to 1840, Masonry in the United States had
fallen into disrepute and almost ceased to exist. After the
torture and death of William Morgan in 1826, many lodges
faded into oblivion to resuscitate only after the storm of
public censure had abated.
During the Civil War, Pike served as brigadier-general in
the Confederate army. The Confederate government named
him Indian Commissioner and charged him with the conduct
of negotiations with the most powerful savage tribes, to raise
an army of their warriors. To facilitate his organization of this
army he was made Governor of Indian Territory, and once
these hordes were united, they were placed under his command. What followed can be easily understood as his troops
were composed of Chickasaws, Comanches,
Creeks, Cherokees, Miamis, Osages, Kansas and
Choc-aws, with all of whom he personally was on the best

of terms. Among them, he was known as " the faithful
pale-face friend and protector ". It was no longer war — it
was an orgy of murder and atrocities so terrible that the
foreign powers interfered. Representations made by England,
threatening intervention in the name of humanity, finally
compelled Jefferson Davis to disband his auxiliary Indian
troops.
Mrs. Liliana Pike Room gives us the following chronological history of her father's early Masonic career. She says
that he became an Oddfellow, some time in the forties, and in
1850 entered the Masonic Fraternity. After that he gradually
ceased to be active as an Oddfellow. Soon becoming
prominent in Masonry he advanced rapidly to the highest
honours. His Masonic record is as follows :
" He was initiated in Western Star Lodge at Little Rock,
Arkansas, in 1850.
" Raised to the degree of Worshipful Master, in Western
Star Lodge No. 1, Little Rock, Arkansas, in July 1850.
" He became Charter Member of Magnolia Lodge, No. 60,
Little Rock, Arkansas, and was Worshipful Master ad vitam
of that lodge in 1853.
' Exalted in Union Chapter No. 2 R. A. M. Little Rock,
Arkansas, in 1850.
" Greeted as Royal and Select Master at Washington, D. C,
1852.
" Created Knight Templar 1858 Washington
Com-mandary No. 1. K. T. in Washington.
" Elected Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of
Arkansas, in 1853.
" In 1856, met Brother Theodor S. Parvin of Connecticut
and received degrees of A. A. (Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rite) from 4° to 32° inclusive, on March 20th, 1853.

The secretary of the Supreme Council at Charleston, at this
time, and its ruling power was Pike's great friend, Gallatin
Mackey.
On the other hand, Margiotta gives the following
particulars :
" Towards this epoch, Pike and Mackey received the visit
of Longfellow. This Longfellow was a Scottish Rites Mason
who, in 1837, had taken up his residence in the United States,
becoming the intimate friend and private secretary of Moses
Holbrook, then Sovereign Commander of the Supreme
Council of Charleston. The intimacy between Longfellow
and Holbrook became quickly serious as both had thoroughly
studied the occult sciences and enjoyed discussing the
mysteries of the Cabala.
' When Longfellow asked his Grand Master's permission
to join the order of the Oddfellows for the purpose of
studying its organization, his request was granted.1
" Oddfellow is the name adopted by the members of a
society founded in London towards 1788. Their meeting

places were called Lodges, as in Masonry, and many were
dissolved under the suspicion that their character was
subversive, though the visible aims of the fraternity were
simply mutual help and diversion. But the society, changing
its location and its name, continued a precarious existence till,
in 1809, several members founded a new lodge at Manchester.
Then some of them separated in 1813 and formed the
independent Order of Oddfellows (I. 0. 0. F.) the members of
the general council of which were all to reside at Manchester.
The order was introduced in America, in 1819, by the
blacksmith (Thomas) Wildey, who founded Washington
Lodge No. 1, at Baltimore. This town became the
headquarters of the American and Canadian Oddfellows and,
thanks to the energy of Wildey, the order made great headway
and spread with rapidity.
" Longfellow and Holbrook, while exchanging views on
the Cabala, had formed the project of creating a Satanic rite in
which the adepts would be instructed in Black Magic, but
Holbrook, the Grand Master of the Supreme Council of
Charleston, who had already composed a suitable ritual and
sacrilegious mass called Adonaicide Mass, died, retarding the
fulfilment of the project. " He was succeeded by John Honour,
after whose death the dream of the Jew, Moses Holbrook, to
subvert Masonry, was fulfilled by Albert Pike on a gigantic
scale.
" Longfellow left Charleston after the death of his patron
and, in 1854, went to Hamilton, Canada. There, with the
authorisation of Wildey, he submitted the rituals of Holbrook
to this flourishing society and it was decided to graft a second
and separate class of adepts, practising secret Satanism, on to
the original body. But Wildey, becoming suddenly jealous,
refused the use of his premises. "

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

"Undiscouraged by obstacles placed in his way by Wildey,
Longfellow returned to Charleston in 1857, where he had
interviews with Pike and Mackey to whom he revealed his
plan. The innovation of Longfellow was declared to be
marvellous, but Pike, who had himself already thought of
introducing Lucife-' danism into the inner shrines of Scottish
Rites Freemasonry, would not take a definite stand, so
Longfellow addressed himself directly to the Grand Master
John Honour. He seemed indifferent to the subject on the
grounds that one could not introduce Satanism into the
Supreme Council of Scottish Rites without the knowledge of
his lieutenant-commander, Charles Furman, who was
opposed to changes of this kind. Finally Longfellow obtained
from Wildey the authorisation secretly to use the Order of the
Oddfellows for the initiations of the second class, which was
to form an absolutely secret rite and to have its centre at
Hamilton. The adepts of the second class Oddfellows,
practising Satanism, then took the name of
Re-Theurgist-Opti-1 mates 2 (used by the Palladists also) and
Longfellow became the Grand Priest of the ' New Evocative

office of Grand Master had become an elective position
which was now destined to be filled by the particular member
of the Fraternity selected by the conspirators. Among these
was Gallatin Mackey, a Luciferian, who proposed Albert Pike,
another Luciferian, for the post of Grand Master of the
Supreme Council of Charleston to which he was duly elected
on January 6th 1859, his candidacy being unopposed.
Margiotta adds :
" Once Grand Master, Pike reestablished the supremacy of
his Supreme Council and succeeded gradually in becoming
an important Masonic personage and the real chief of Scottish
Rites ".
In 1806, a jeweller, Joseph Cerneau, founded a rival rite in
New York composed of the same 33 degrees of initiation as
the order of which he himself was chief. This rite, which was
later worked by F. Foulhouze, an American, excited the ire of
the Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry who waged
a ceaseless warfare of excommunication against it.
From letters scattered through different masonic archives,
it is evident that Mazzini formed his great project after 1866.
The grand patriarch of the sect in Europe, Lord Palmerston,
had died. Convinced that the power he had wielded was
purely the result of personal influence with the different
chiefs and that, not being based on an efficient organization it
was unlikely to endure, Mazzini set himself to study the
problem of the international organization of Freemasonry,
and in 1870 reached an agreement with Pike for the creation
of the Supreme Rite.
The Franco-Prussian war, which, enabled the King of
Piedmont, already called King of Italy, to take Rome,
favoured the abolition of the temporal power of the Pope, and
at this time the constitution of central high

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

215

masonry was decreed and signed between Albert Pike and
Giuseppe Mazzini. The act of creation is dated Sept. 20, 1870,
the day upon which the army of invasion, commanded by the
Freemason, General Cadorna, entered the Eternal City.
The two founders divided their powers according to the
following plan. To Pike was given dogmatic authority and
the title of Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry,
while Mazzini held the executive authority with the title of
Sovereign Chief of Political Action. Mazzini evinced great
deference towards the views of the Patriarch of Charleston
and begged him to draw up the statutes of the grades of the
Supreme Secret Rite which would thus be the liturgic bonds
of the members of centralized high masonry.
Albert Pike, in honour of his Templar Baphomet, which
was in the keeping of his first and historic Supreme Council,
named the order the New and Reformed Palla-dian Rite or
New and Reformed Palladium. 3
" It was agreed ", continues Margiotta, " that the existence
of this rite would be kept strictly secret and that no mention of
it would ever be made in the assemblies of the Lodges and
Inner Shrines of other rites, even when by accident, the
meeting might happen to be composed exclusively of
brothers having the perfect initiation, for the secret of the new
institution was only to be divulged with the greatest
caution to a

Order of the Palladium' was founded in 1730 and soon
afterwards introduced in Charleston where it remained inactive
until 1886, It blossomed anew under the name of ' Reformed
Palladium ' and gave a new impulse to the traditions of High
Masonry. Stevens adds that the Palladium is little known as
the number of its members is strictly limited and the deepest
secrecy surrounds all its deliberations.

chosen few belonging to the ordinary high grades. * " To
recruit adepts, they planned to use some members of the other
rites, but in the beginning they meant to rely principally on
those among the initiates of Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rites who were already addicted to occultism.
" Everyone knows that in masonry from the degree of
Master, a mason may, without being a member of a lodge,
assist at sessions as a visitor, at Lodges not belonging to his
own rite or even to his own national federation, provided he is
a regular active mason and presents himself at a lodge
working at a degree equal to, or below the highest degree of
which he is possessed. Thus a Rose Croix (18th degree
Scottish Rites), travelling in any country, may, if he frequents
assiduously his lodge and chapter, present himself at any
lodge of a degree equal, to or inferior to his own and assist at
a seance, but he cannot enter an areopagus of Knights
Kadosch (30th degree), even one of his own rite. A 33rd
would be well received everywhere, in any country, in any
rite the existence of which is acknowledged. Thus it was
particularly the initiates of the thirty-third degree Scottish
Rites, who, owing to their extensive international
ramifications, were privileged to recruit adepts for Palladism.
That is why the supreme rite created its Triangles (the name
given to Palladian Lodges) by degrees, but these were
established on a firm base, the lowliest of its initiates being
brothers long tested in ordinary masonry.
" One will better understand these precautions knowing
that Palladism is essentially a Luciferian rite. Its religion is
Manichean neo-gnosticism, teaching that the divinity is dual
and that Lucifer is the equal

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

217

of Adonay, with Lucifer, the God of Light and Goodness
struggling for humanity against Adonay the God of Darkness
and Evil. In stating this principle of the secret cult of the
triangles, Albert Pike had only specified and unveiled the
dogmas of the high grades of all other masonries, for in no
matter what rite, the Great Architect of the Universe is not the
God worshipped by the Christians.
" For other reasons these precautions were still necessary,
in order to render possible the exercise of a supreme central
directing power, reaching all the rites through the personal
influence of the Elects and Perfect Initiates, these being
invested with privileges, and giving the impulse, which
emanated from the source of the highest universal authority.
If Brothers, not fully initiated, had suspected the existence of
this supreme organization, it is evident that, in the ordinary
Lodges there would always have been a tendency to resist the
motions of such privileged persons.
" To insure the creation and good working of this
formidable machine of Palladism, Mazzini had reserved for
himself the office of Chief of Political Action nor had he
hesitated in bowing to the will of the Patriarch of Charleston
who, by his preponderance in Scottish Rites, could easily
penetrate all countries of the globe with "Ihe new institution.
That is the reason for Mazzini giving supremacy to the
dogmatic over the political authority in
International
Freemasonry.
' The Holy See of the Dogma for the whole masonic world
was set up at Charleston, the sacred city of the Palladium.
Pike, the Sovereign Pontiff of Lucifer, was the president of
the Supreme Dogmatic Directory, composed of ten brothers
of the highest grades who formed his Supreme Grand College
of Emeritus Masons. The Sovereign Executive Directory of
High Masonry was

218

established at Rome under Mazzini himself who, knowing the
rivalry between the different Supreme Councils in Italy,
seldom appeared at the official meetings of the Grand Orient
of Rome, and, so as not to awaken suspicion in the minds of
ordinary high grade Italian Masons in whom he had not
confided the secret of the new institution, pretended to be
occupied with socialism only ".
Rut was this interest, plan or pretence ?
In the following paragraph on the International in World
Revolution by N. Webster, page 179, we find a link, if not the
link, between Mazzini and Karl Marx. Mazzini and his
International Masons are already preparing the subversion of
the Socialist Labour movement.
" At the meeting in St. Martin's Hall, on September 28,
1864, when the ' International' was definitely founded, Marx
played no part at all. ' I was present', he wrote Engels, ' only as
a dumb personage on the platform'. Rut he was named
nevertheless a member of the sub-committee, the other
members being Mazzini's secretary— a Polish Jew named
Wolff — Le Lubez, a French Freemason, Cremer, the
secretary of the English Masons' Union, and Weston, the
Owenite. At the first meeting of this committee, Wolff placed
before it the statutes of Mazzini's Working-men's Association,
proposing them as the basis of the new association; Le Lubez
suggested amendments described by Marx as ' perfectly
childish '. ' I was firmly resolved ', he wrote, 'not to leave a
single line if possible of all their balderdash'. In a few weeks
he had succeeded in establishing his authority. ' My
propositions were all accepted by the commission.' "
As to whether Marx thus manoeuvred himself into a
dominant position in the movement, or Mazzini's

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

219

agents manoeuvred Marx into this position to suit their own
ends, is left to our imagination, but the fact of someone, not
an outstanding personality, being elected or nominated on a
committee for no particular reason, generally means, to
anyone versed in the technique of political tricks, that the
nomination or election was something arranged " behind the
scenes ".
On page 46 in La Theologie Politique de Mazzini et
I'lnternationale, Bakounine, the celebrated Russian anarchist,
refutes certain statements said to have been current in London
about himself at the time, in the following terms :
"But in 1864, while on my way through London, he (Karl
Marx) came to see me, and assured me that he (Mazzini) had
never taken any part direct or indirect in these calumnies
against me which he himself had considered most infamous. I
had to believe. "
It is a fact that for a certain length of time Mazzini and
Marx were closely associated.
An eminent Mason, the atheist leader of the Italian
Socialists, Alberto Mario, husband of Miss Jessie White, an
ardent Mazzinian and the authoress of a history of her hero —
Delia vita di Giuseppe Mazzini — was moreover a tool of
Pike whom he generally consulted on all important matters.
Thus, in order to divert the attention of the imperfect initiates,
Mazzini organized a congress of working men in Rome, in
October 1871. A close examination of the work of this
congress shows however that it was only pretence for nothing
practical was attempted or accomplished. On the other hand,
he busied himself with grouping all the political elements of
the sect in which occult manoeuvre his agent, Adriano
Lemmi, helped him more than anyone else.
" When Pike sent him a copy of his Luciferian rituals,
Mazzini was full of an enthusiastic praise for his col-

220

OCCULT THEOCRASY

league's work which he expressed in his articles in La Roma
del Popolo. The public however failed to understand the
sentiment that inspired him to proclaim the existence of a
divinity and denounce materialism and atheism. One was
puzzled to find this man a mystic. He showed himself
extremely religious yet he declared himself the sworn enemy
of the Church ! " 5
Pike's literary achievements were numerous. These were,
Ariel, Morals and Dogma, The Sacred Hymns, The Sephar H.
Debarim, Book of the Word6, Legenda Magistralia, Ritual of
the New and Reformed Palladium (4 grades out of 5) The
Booh of Revelations, The Supreme Verb, The Ritual of Elect
Magus, and The Booh of Apadno, which latter contains the
prophecies concerning the reign of the Anti-Christ from the
Satanic point of view.
The theological dogma of Albert Pike is explained in the '
Instructions ' issued by him, on July 14, 1889, to the 23
Supreme Councils of the world and have been recorded by A.
C. De La Rive in La Femme et I'Enfant dans la
Franc-Magonnerie Universelle (page 588) from which book
we translate and quote as follows :
" That which we must say to the crowd is — We worship a
God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition.
" To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this,
that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st and
30th degrees — The Masonic religion should be, by all of us
initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the
Luciferian doctrine.
" If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay (The God
5. Margiotta, op. cit, p. 100.
6. Rosen, Magonnerie pratique, vol. I, p. 434.

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

22 1

of the Christians) whose deeds prove his cruelty, perfidy, and
hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would
Adonay and his priests, calumniate
him?
" Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also
God. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade,
no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the
absolute can only exist as two Gods : darkness being
necessary to light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is
necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive.
" In analogical and universal dynamics one can only lean
on that which will resist. Thus the universe is balanced by two
forces which maintain its equilibrium : the force of attraction
and that of repulsion. These two forces exist in physics,
philosophy and religion. And the scientific reality of the
divine dualism is demonstrated by the phenomena of polarity
and by the universal law of sympathies and antipathies. That
is why the intelligent disciples of Zoroaster, as well as, after
them, the Gnostics, the Manicheans and the Templars have
admitted, as the only logical metaphysical conception, the
system of the two divine principles fighting eternally, and one
cannot believe the one inferior in power to the other.
" Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy ; and the true
and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the
equal of Adonay ; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good,
is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of
Darkness and Evil. "
One must not lose sight of the fact that Pike occupied
simultaneously the positions of Grand Master of the Central
Directory of Washington, that of Grand Commander of the
Supreme Council of Charleston and that of Sovereign Pontiff
of Universal Freemasonry.

222

OCCULT THEOCRASY

In 1880, a charter was granted himbythe Royal Order of
Scotland for the foundation of Lodges in America appointing
him Provincial Grand Master of the order of H. R. M. He was
indeed a great organizer.
Margiotta further writes:
" The two secret chiefs, Pike and Mazzini, finally
completed the organization of high masonry, establishing
four Grand Central Directories for the world, functioning
thenceforth to gather information for the benefit of their
political policy and dogmatic propaganda. These were, The
Grand Central Directories for North America at Washington,
for South America at Montevideo, for Europe at Naples, and
for Asia and Oceania at Calcutta. Later, a central
Sub-Directory for Africa was founded at Port Louis, Island of
Mauritius, and after the death of Mazzini, the supreme chief
constituted a Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory
at Berlin which ranked in the hierarchy after the Sovereign
Executive Directories and before the four Great Central
Directories. "
Gallatin Mackey, the confidant of Albert Pike, died in
Charleston on June 20, 1881. He was the author of many
works on masonry, namely The Lexicon of Freemasonry,
published in New York in 1845, The History of Freemasonry
in South Carolina, The Manual of the Lodge, The Masonic
Ritualist, The Symbolism of Freemasonry and The
Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, the authorship of which is
generally now attributed to Albert George Mackey.
According to the fundamental constitution of the
Palladium, the nomination of the Chief of Political Action,
the President of the Sovereign Executive Directory, was not
an elective office. Its incumbent was an appointee of the
Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry.

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

When Mazzini felt himself to be dying, he designated
Adriano Lemmi as his successor. He died on March 11 1872,
at Pisa, and Albert Pike, deferring to his wishes, named
Adriano Lemmi as his successor.
Pike was not only an organizer and a politician, he was
also, in his religious capacity, as Cabalist and spiritist, a
mystic on whose personality the following anecdote sheds a
flood of light.
" Speaking before the Supreme Council of Charles-ion, on
October 20, 1884, he gave an account of his recent travels
through the United States and some incidental experiences.
One of these, he described as follows : — 'At Saint Louis, we
operated the grand rites, and through Sister Ingersoll, who is
a first class medium, received astonishing revelations during
a solemn Palladian session at which I presided, assisted by
Brother Friedman and Sister Warhnburn. Without putting
Sister Ingersoll to sleep, we saturated her with the spirit of
Ariel himself, but Ariel took possession of her with 329 more
spirits of fire and the seance from then on was marvellous.
Sister Ingersoll, lifted into space, floated over the assembly
and her garments were suddenly devoured by a flame which
enfolded, without burning her. We saw her thus in a state of
nudity for over ten minutes. Flitting above our heads, as
though borne by an invisible cloud, or upheld by beneficent
spirits, she answered all questions put to her. We thus soon
had the latest news of our very illustrious brother Adriano
Lemmi. Then, Astaroth, in person, revealed himself, flying
beside our medium and holding her hand. He breathed upon
her and her clothes, returning from nowhere, clothed her
again. Finally Astaroth vanished and our sister fell gently on
to a chair where, with her head thrown back she gave up Ariel
and the 329 spirits who had accompanied him.

224

We counted 330 exhalations in all at the end of this most
successful experiment. " 7
A number of books of this period refer to what must have
been a wireless telephone in the possession of the heads of the
Masonic organization. A translation of the detailed
description of this instrument, given in Ba-taille's book, is
quoted herewith as being of interest in these days when magic
sometimes becomes experimental science. At the date on
which this description was first printed (1894) wireless was
unknown.
" In his house, Gallatin Mackey once showed me that
Arcula Mystica (the Mystic Box), of which there are only
seven examples in existence, at Charleston, Borne, Berlin,
Washington, Monte Video, Naples and Calcutta. 8
" The exterior of this small box resembles a liqueurs
receptacle. A spring catch opens simultaneously its two doors
and lid. Inside, in the middle, stands a telephone mouthpiece
in silver, which, at first sight, one would take for a very small
trumpet or hunting horn. At the left is a little rope made of
twisted silver threads, one end of which is attached to the
machine while the other extremity ends in a, kind of little bell
which one holds to one's ear to hear the voice of the person
with whom one is speaking, just like the telephone of today.
At the right is a toad, -in silver, with its mouth open. Placed
around the opening of the mouth-piece, stand seven statuettes
in gold, each on a small separate silver pedestal representing
symbolically the seven cardinal virtues of the Palladian
Ladder.
" Each of these seven statuettes designates one of the
Directories. The statuette Ignis (sacred fire) divine endeavour,
stands for the Supreme Dogmatic Direc7. Bataille, Le Diable au XIX* siecle, p. 360 et seq.

tory of Charleston ; Ratio (Reason, triumphant over
superstition), the Sovereign Executive Directory of Rome ;
Labor (Labour) the Sovereign Administrative Directory of
Berlin ; Ubertas (fecundity), Caritas (Masonic Charity),
Emancipatio (the emancipation of humanity shedding the
yoke of all despotisms) and Felicitas (Happiness derived
from virtuous practices) representing the four Grand Central
Directories of Washington, Naples, Monte Video and
Calcutta.
" 'When the Supreme Dogmatical chief wishes to
communicate, for example, with the head of political action,
he presses his finger on the Statuette Ignis and on the
Statuette Ratio : these sink into their sockets and at the same
instant, a strong whistling is heard in Rome, in the office
where Lemmi keeps his Arcula Mystica ; Lemmi opens his
box and sees the statuette of Ignis sunk, while tiny, harmless
flames issue from the throat of the silver toad. Then he knows
that the Sovereign Pontiff of Charleston wishes to speak to
him. He presses down the statuette of Ratio in his box and
from then on, the conversation between the two chiefs
proceeds, each one speaking directly into the mouthpiece
described above, while at the same time holding to his ear the
small silver bell.
" At the end of the conversation, each chief replaces the
golden statuettes by pulling them up by the head.
" Every Sovereign Grand Master of a Directory travels
with his Arcula Mystica. This box is personally confided to
him. That of the Administrative Directory of Berlin is kept by
the Sovereign Finance Delegate... who is
actually
Bleichroeder (1893).
" It is evidently necessary to detach the memory of Albert
Pike from the great number of exaggerated legends which
cling to his name, but with a man of

OCCULT THEOCRASY

this type one never knows just what to think. His. reputation
as an Occultist had overstepped the doors of the lodges and
inner shrines. Everyone knew from hearsay that he gave
himself up to Luciferian practices. "
Owing to the discredit cast upon Bataille's writings, we
now quote in corroboration of the existence of such rites as
described above from the well known theo-1 sophist Mrs.
Alice A. Bailey's book, Initiation Human and Solar,
(published 1922 by the Lucifer Publishing Co., New York),
which has never been challenged : —
Such quotations touch upon the following subjects :
Description of the Deity.
Description of Initiation and fire.
Description, of Sex and fire.
Description of the Seven Rays.

called in the Bible ' The Ancient of Days ', and in the Hindu
Scriptures the First Kumara, He, Sanat Kumara it is, Who

over the Lodge of Masters, and holds in His hands the reins of
government in all the three departments. Called in some
Scriptures ' the Great Sacrifice ', He has chosen to watch over
the evolution of men and devas until all have been occultly '
saved '. He it is Who, four times a year, meets in conference
with all the Chohans and Masters, and authorises what shall
be done to further the ends of evolution.. " 9
Call it Lucifer, Satan or the Devil, it is always the same old
manifestation revamped now as Sanat Kumara and, while he
may indeed seem to be a very good god,

his presence alone is our only concern at the moment.
2. As to initiation, — " The Hierophant utters the
word, and the force is literally thrown into the initiate's
bodies and centres, passing down through the centres
on the mental plane, via the astral centres, to the centres
on etheric levels, which finally absorb it. This is the stu
pendous moment for the initiate, and brings to him a
realisation of the literal absolute truth of the phrase
that ' God is a consuming fire '. He knows past all
gainsaying that fiery energy and electric force constitute
the sum-total of all that is. He is literally bathed in the
fires of purification ; he sees fire on all sides, pouring out
through the Rod (of initiation) circulating around the
Triangle, and passing through the bodies of the two spon
soring adepts. For a brief second, the entire Lodge of
Masters and initiates, standing in their ceremonial places
without the Triangle, are hidden from view by a wall of
fire. The initiate sees no one, save the Hierophant, and
is aware of nothing but a fiery blaze of pure, blue-white
flame, which burns, but destroys not, which intensifies
the activity of every atom in his body without disinte
grating, and which purifies his entire nature. The fire
tries his work, of what sort it is, and he passes through
the Flame. 10
" At the fifth initiation the great secret which concerns the
fire or spirit aspect is revealed to the wondering and amazed
Master, and He realises in a sense incomprehensible to man
the fact that all is fire and fire is all. " n

" This means, literally, the control by the initiate of the sex
impulse, as usually understood, and the transference of the
fire which now normally vitalises the generative organs to the
throat centre, thus leading to creation upon the mental plane
through the agency of mind... "

Groups of Egos are formed :
1. According to their ray.
2. According to their sub-ray.
3. According to their rate of vibration.
They are also grouped for purposes of classification :
1. As Egos, according to the egoic ray.
2. As personalities, according to the subray which is
governing the personality. 13
" All are graded and charted. The Masters have Their Halls
of Records, with a system of tabulation incomprehensible to
us owing to its magnitude and its necessary intricacies
wherein these charts are kept. They are under the care of a
Chohan of a Ray, each Ray having its own collection of
charts... These Halls of Records are mostly on the lowest
levels of the mental plane and the highest of the astral, as they
can be there most fully utilised and are most easily accessible.
"
" While the ray business may be an excellent scientific,
though little known, method of keeping in touch with the
adepts it has one very serious disadvantage, namely, that
whoever is attuned to a ray is, in case of revenge or evil intent
on the part of a superior, (shall we say scientist ?) vulnerable
on this ray! "
One is almost astonished at the frankness displayed by
Mrs. Bailey in her revelations concerning the secrets of
Initiation, when one remembers the tragic fate of

William Morgan, the secret condemnation, kidnapping and
sequestration, torture and final assassination of this New
York Journalist who had published for the profane public the
principal masonic rituals of the period. Carlile, in his Manual
of Freemasonry, gives the following particulars : — " My
exposure of Freemasonry, in 1825, led to its exposure in the
United States of America; and a Mason there, of the name of
William Morgan, having announced his intention of assisting
in the work of exposure, was kidnapped, under pretended
forms and warrants of law, by his brother Masons, removed
from the State of New York to the borders of Canada, near
the falls of Niagara, and there most barbarously murdered.
This happened in 1826. The States have been for many years
much excited upon the subject; a regular warfare has arisen
between Masons and anti-Masons. Societies of anti-Masons
have been formed, newspapers and magazines started, and
many pamphlets and volumes, with much correspondence,
published ; so that before the slavery question was passed
amongst them, all parties had merged themselves into
Masons and anti-Masons. Several persons were punished for
the abduction of Morgan : but the murderers were sheltered
by Masonic Lodges, and rescued from justice. "
" The story of the murder of William Morgan for the crime
of violating Masonic secrecy has long been a well known
historical fact ; but in August, 1875, the full particulars were
brought to light by the publication of two letters from the
Venerable Thurlow Weed. The facts were as follows : 14
" In the year 1826, Morgan, who had passed through all the
degrees of Masonry and held a very high posi14. Gargano, Irish and English Freemasons, p. 73.

230

tion in the Order, conceived the idea of publishing a book
disclosing all the secrets of the sect. What his motive may
have been is only conjectural. Mr. Weed was living at that
time in the town of Rochester, New York, and Morgan
requested him to publish the projected book. Mr. Weed
declined, and Morgan went to the adjoining town of Batavia,
where he arranged with another person for the publication.
" He had written a portion of the book, and was engaged in
completing it when he was arrested on a false charge of
larceny, on the 10th Sept., and conveyed to the jail of Ontario
county. The sheriff and officers of this prison were Masons.
His house was searched, and his manuscripts were seized and
destroyed.
"On the evening of the 12th Sept, he was discharged by the
interference of some of the conspirators, and, as he passed out
of the door of the jail, was seized by them, taken a short
distance, and then forcibly put into a carriage. He was carried,
in the course of that night, on to the ridge-road about two
miles beyond the village of Rochester. During the next day,
he was taken to Lewiston, a distance of seventy or eighty
miles, and from thence to Fort Niagara, at the mouth of the
Niagara river. His benevolent captors had decided on
bringing him here in the hope that their brother Masons of
Canada would aid them in disposing of him. His murder was
not then contemplated ; but it was hoped that the Canadian
Masons would take charge of him and send him to end his
days among the Indian tribes, in the north-west of Canada.
Placing their prisoner in Fort Niagara, his captors crossed the
river into Canada to attend a meeting of a lodge there ; but the
Canadian Masons, after much deliberation, refused to
become parties to the business. The American Masons
returned to Fort Niagara, and in a few days

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

afterwards a large number of men, high in the order,
assembled a short distance off to open an Encampment of
Knight Templars, the additional power of the ' sealed
obligation ' being necessary for such a case. At night they
dined together, and, after dinner, the chaplain gave a
sentiment so significant that all thoughts were turned towards
Fort Niagara. The ' sentiment' was, in fact, ' death to all
traitors' and immediately afterwards one of the company,
Colonel King, arose from the table and called four of the
others to accompany him. These were Whitney, a
stonemason ; Chubbuch, a farmer; Garside, a butcher; and
Howard, a bookbinder. ' They were all' says Mr. Weed, ' men
of correct habits and good character, and all, I doubt not, were
moved by an enthusiastic but most misguided sense of duty '.
King told them that he had an order from the Grand Master,
the execution of which required their assistance, and they
replied that they would obey it. The five murderers were then
driven in a carriage to the fort where Morgan was confined. It
was just midnight. They told the doomed man that his friends
had completed their arrangements for his removal to Canada,
where his life would be safe. He consented to go with them,
and they walked to the wharf where a boat was waiting for
them ; they embarked and rowed away into the darkness.
When the boat reached the point where Niagara River
empties itself into Lake Ontario, the murderers threw off all
pretence, and with some horrible mummeries ordered Morgan to prepare for death. They wound a rope around him,
attaching to each end of it a heavy weight, and threw him
overboard. He sank like a stone, and the murderers returned
to tell their comrades that the traitor had met a traitor's doom.
One of the murderers, Whitney, told all these particulars to
Mr. Weed

232

a few months afterwards, but it is only now, when all the
criminals are dead, that he makes the fact public. The body of
Morgan was found a year afterwards, identified by his wife
and friends, and buried ; and although the Masons tried to
dispute the identification, their efforts were futile. None of
the murderers was ever brought to justice. " 15
So much for the oath of secrecy and brotherhood I
Nowadays, greater precautions are observed in getting rid
of the enemies of the sect. Some little study and the
cooperation of a few culpable doctors, its auxiliaries and
affiliates, enable the terrible sect to dispose easily of their
enemies. The victim of their vengeance, swallowing some
disease germ, meets a fate that none can prove to have been
artificially contrived. This is the secret of secrets, denied
again and again ! And yet the charge remains ! For plague,
cholera and all epidemics can be let loose on the world at a
word from the Hidden Masters !
But to return to the organization of Freemasonry.
It is necessary here to say that in many instances, where a
masculine lodge has a feminine annex, its existence is
frequently completely ignored by the majority of the brothers.
No mutual visiting is allowed among the female members of
the lower masonic degrees, for a sister may enter lodges other
than her own, only after she has herself attained the fifth
degree. As well
15. Blanchard, Scottish Rite Masonry Illustrated, p. 33. " In
his address before his Council in 1878, Albert Pike said :
' I am often asked why we do not publish our old transactions,
to which I am compelled to reply, that we have none to publish.
We have no records of the transactions at Charleston from 1801
to 1860. What records we had were destroyed... during the war.
(American Civil War.)' "

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

as masculine General Inspectors on permanent missions, in
direct communication with Charleston, there are General
Inspectresses, high grade women masons belonging to
ordinary Masonry who, while not necessarily affiliated to
palladism, serve the purpose of its leaders, their good offices
being much appreciated when they furnish useful information
to headquarters. These women are privileged to enter the
lodges and inner shrines of masonry only, but are not
admitted to Palla-1 dian triangles. As for men belonging to an
adoptive lodge where brothers and sisters work together they
must have at least attained the 32nd (Prince of the Royal
Secret) or a corresponding grade in another rote before they
can enter an Areopagus of Sublime Ecos-1 saise.
As regards the position of women in Masonry, we think
that this cannot be better explained than in the words of
Albert Pike himself. In La Femme et I'Enfant dans la
Franc-Magonnerie Universelle page 578, A. C. De La Rive
states that on July 14, 1889, Albert Pike, Sovereign Pontiff of
Universal Freemasonry, addressed to the 23 Supreme
Confederated Councils of the world the following
instructions, which we quote herewith in part.
" To the science of Faust, the real Mason will join the
impassibility of Job. He will eradicate superstition from his
heart and cultivate decision of character. He will accept
pleasure only when he wishes it and will wish it only when he
should do so.
" We earnestly recommend the creation of Lodges of
Adoption. They are indispensable to the formation of Masons
who are indeed Masters of themselves. The pnest tries to
subdue his flesh by enforced celibacy... The real Mason, on
the contrary, reaches perfection, that is to say achieves self
mastery, by using his zeal

234

OCCULT THEOCRASY

in the Lodges of Adoption in submitting to all natural ordeals.
Commerce with women, belonging to all brethren, forms for
him an armour against those passions which lead hearts astray.
He alone can really possess voluptuousness. To be able, at
will, to use or to abstain, is a twofold power. Woman fetters
thee by thy desires, we say to the adept, well, use women
often and without passion; thou wilt thus become master of
thy desires, and thou wilt enchain woman. From which it
must perforce result that the real Mason will succeed in easily
solving the problem of the flesh.
" It is evidently not absolutely necessary that the man
whom you are leading towards the high grades be
immediately perfect and have understood our secret on his
entrance into Masonry. That which we ask you is first to
observe him with the greatest care during his apprenticeship
and afterwards, when he enters the Lodge of Adoption as
Companion to use that as your criterion, your instrument
of infallible control.
" The Lodge of Brothers which has failed to annex a Lodge
of Sisters is incomplete and destined inevitably never to
produce anything but Brethren, with whom politics are the
chief concern, men who will be chiefly preoccupied with
intrigue and rivalry, who will do bad work and whose politics
will be incoherent. "
Dr. Bataille elucidates this point in the following terms :
" Concerning androgynous lodges, Masons generally give
the same answer. They either say 'Yes, once upon a time there
were sister masons but there are none any longer ' or, if forced
to make a concession say, ' Lodges admitting women are
irregular and function entirely outside of Masonry proper,
unrecognized by Grand Orients and Supreme Councils '. "
" Having referred to the great care exercised to

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

23 5

hide the existence of the sister masons, it is now opportune to
expose the ruse employed in stifling further investigation.
From time to time, one of the semi-initiates is urged to bring a
resolution suggesting the establishment of feminine lodges,
and a petition is drawn up and sent in to the Grand Orient or
Supreme Council, whereupon the chiefs gravely insert a
decree in the official bulletin rejecting the petition, and
emphasising the point that ' the constitution is opposed to the
creation of regular female lodges '. Then, whenever the
question of sister masons is raised in the profane press, —
quick! The Grand Orients and Supreme Councils publish
these famous decrees. " 16
In certain cities where masonic secrecy is less carefully
guarded, a part of the masonic premises is available for the
use of the profane public and daily lectures or instructions of
the brother professors. In these rooms, every evening,
accounting, stenography, foreign languages and other
popular professional accomplishments are taught, a great
activity is thus created around masonic headquarters and the
entrance of a woman more or less attracts no attention. The
sister masons, however, know to which room they must go
and, once past the threshold of the building, it is not to the
professorial lecture room that they wend their way.
In connection with Eastern occultism and its organization
Dr. Bataille made the following statement and curious
deduction : " A number of Satanic monasteries are concealed
today under the guise of Musulman harems or annexes to
Lama, or Brahmin monasteries, but it is possible that some
day these institutions might take root in Europe where, under
a deceptive exterior,
• Bataille, op. cit, pp. 475, 478.

233

OCCULT THEOCRASY

one of these communities might be established. When one knows
the true mission of the ' Pink Serpents ' one wonders if
Christianity will not presently assist at this crowning abomination
— a convent of so called Christians practising luciferianism.
" The ' Pink Serpents ' are sister masons. They are the luciferian
missionaries and operate as individuals and under conditions of the
greatest secrecy. No records of the money appropriated for these
religious spies are shown. "
But let us resume the subject of Palladism as explained by Dr.
Bataille.
" This super-rite, which is masonic luciferian spiritism, must not
be confused with the machinery of high masonry. Palladism is the
cult of Satan in the inner shrines of a rite superposed to ail the rites.
It is a cult, a religion. High masonry is a supreme administration
involving an organization much more highly developed than
Palladism whose secret leaders, some of whom are not luciferian,
act in concert and accept a superior central authority in order that
their work may be the more effective 17.
" In founding the New and Reformed Palladian rite, General Pike
did not create masonic occultism. Anderson, Desaguliers,
Weishaupt, Swedenborg, Lessing, Frederic II of Prussia, Mesmer,
Pernety, Cagliostro, Martinez Pasqualis and his disciple
Saint-Martin,. Francia (the dictator of Paraguay) Lord Palmerston,
General Contreras, Mazzini, and many other distinguished
Freemasons practised occultism and worked at the Great Work of
the Cabala,18 but before the year
17. Bataille, op. cit, vol. I, p. 346 et seq.
18. Chacornac, Eliphas Levi, p. 191.
" Importuned by his friends Ch. Fauvety and Caubet,

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

23 7

1870, the inner shrines all operated without other direction than that
of the theurgic rituals of Swedenborg, Saint-Martin, Laffon,
Landebat, and the Vicomte de la Jonquiere, etc. and the Masonic
initiates of Herme-' ticism were widely dispersed in different
schools which were local and not international.
" While Pike laid the foundation of Palladism at Charleston,
Mazzini organized the centralization of Political action in Rome,
and two years after the founding of the Sovereign Executive and the
Supreme Dogmatic Directories, a third, the Sovereign Administrative Directory, was instituted in Berlin. This latter functioned by
means of a constantly renewed committee of seven taken from the
Supreme Councils, Grand Encampments, Grand Orients, and
Grand Lodges of the world. By means of an ingeniously contrived
system of rotation, these representatives act by virtue of their
mandate for three months only. Each of the existing rites, with the
exception of the Palladian, send annually to Berlin two of its
members of the Superior degrees, drawn from any country except
Germany, which alone, of all those represented, is
who both belonged to the Grand Orient, Eliphas Levi became a
Mason on March 14, 1861, being initiated in the Lodge Rose du
Parfait Silence of which Caubet was the Venerable. The ceremony
was performed in the presence of many brothers. " In his reception
speech, Eliphas Levi, to the great astonishment of his auditors, little
inclined to paradoxes, made the following statement.
I come to bring you your lost traditions, the exact knowledge of
your signs and emblems, and in consequence to show you the aim
for the attainment of which your association has been constituted. '
He then tried to demonstrate to his coreligionists that Masonic
symbolism is borrowed from the Cabala. It was time wasted. No
one believed him."

entitled to one permanent member whose quarterly-term of
office expires at the end of the time allotted to the particular
lodge of which he is a delegate... The members of the
Sovereign Administrative Directory are always given 120
days notice of their appointments in order to enable them to
plan what would appear to be a pleasure trip or a holiday,
when, in fact, they are going on the business of the
association.
" Two special delegates are permanently attached to the
Directory of Berlin, one for finance and one for propaganda.
At the present date, (1894) Bleichroeder fills the first
mentioned position and Findel, a non-1 luciferian, the second.
These officers are obliged to live in Germany and to be in a
sufficiently independent position to be able to go to the seat of
the Directory at a moment's notice.
" The business of the Propaganda agent is to furnish
information to the chiefs at Rome and Charleston... He
receives monthly, by secret messenger from Berlin, the report
of all measures formulated at the Sovereign Administrative
Directory relating to means and methods judged useful in
spreading the principles of the association.
" After a meeting he examines, coordinates and frames a
report of the decisions upon which, three months later, the
seven members of the Berlin Directory will vote. Of these
seven members, thanks to the system of rotation explained
above, there are always at least two who, having belonged to
the Directory at the time of the submission of the resolution
under consideration, are able to furnish commentaries and
explanations to the new comers. Only resolutions having
obtained a favourable vote of five or seven voices can be
registered by the delegate recorder, and these can be finally
adopted only on the second following month,

ALBERT PIKE AND GIUSEPPE MAZZINI

23 9

if they pass unanimously. 19 In the event of one or more
persons opposing a measure, the matter is referred to the
Chief at Rome after which, failing his approval, it is settled
arbitrarily by the chief at Charleston from whose decision
there is no appeal.
" The business of the financial agent is not a matter of
funds, it consists in drawing up a general balance sheet of all
rites, in all countries with the brother accountant working
under his orders as a sworn expert.
" As above said, the Palladian rite has no share in the
functioning of the Sovereign Administrative Directory. This
should again prove that Palladism is superposed to all the
other rites. It is the luciferian religion and only need concern
itself with the triangles which have a separate budget. Being
the real hidden power, known only to the perfect initiates, it
need not unveil itself even to this permanent committee which
constitutes the highest expression of the administrative power
of the great international association. One must also not lose
sight of the fact that among the masonic powers, there are
several countries where the Symbolic Grand Lodges
recognize only three grades of which that of Master is the
third and highest degree. These lodges, like the others, are
entitled to send two delegates from time to time to Berlin, and,
as a consequence of having suppressed the high grades for
their adepts, these Federations are necessarily kept in complete ignorance of the existence of Palladism. The Supreme
chiefs of Charleston and Rome appear to
19. Such a system, owing to its apparently democratic character would admirably serve the purposes of an autocracy.
After five months it is obvious that none of the original members who proposed a resolution would be present and five
months gives plenty of time for manipulation of nominees
pledged to vote according to the dictates of invisible masters.

them solely as earnest, active brothers who should be
consulted because of their great personal experience — but
that is all. "
" Finally the Palladists have no need to be officially
represented in Berlin, as most of the members of the Supreme
Councils, Grand Encampments and Grand Orients are their
men and any important proposition is
immediately
communicated to them.
" Under the Sovereign Directory, the Executive at Rome
and the Administrative at Berlin, come the Grand Central
Directories which are bureaus of registration in the different
parts of the world. These are located in North America, South
America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. There is as well a
sub-Directory for Africa. At their heads are the high grade
trusted brothers by whom everything that emanates from the
Supreme Councils, Grand Encampments, Grand Orients and
Grand Lodges of their jurisdiction is centralized. Independent
of the Sovereign Administrative Directory of Berlin, they
operate directly under the chiefs of Rome and Charleston and
it is by these central Directories that these two great intriguers
are kept informed of the trend of world affairs.
" As everything comes to the Grand Central Directories so
everything emanates from them. Five messengers to
Washington, Montevideo, Naples, Calcutta, and Port Louis
will put in motion the formidable machinery of Freemasonry
the world over. "
If the organization described in the foregoing pages which
were written by Bataille forty years ago has progressed along
the lines above indicated, one can easily conjecture the degree
of perfection which has doubtless been attained to-day.

CHAPTER

XXXI

PRACTICAL POLITICS

The game of politics is the pursuit of power. In all
democracies, there are two separate organizations playing the
political game. The open and visible one, the members of
which hold office as members of a government, and the
invisible one composed of individuals who control this
visible organization and in whom is vested the real power, the
essence of which is finance, controlling the publicity which
makes or unmakes its tools.
This financial power may be used to promote truth or
fallacies, good or evil, national prosperity or national ruin,
but so long as human nature is what it is, so long as jealousy,
greed, personal ambition and expediency can sway the lives
of men, so long will the rule of the invisible power prevail by
methods inimical to the best interests of a nation. The
strength of a democracy thus lies at the mercy of invisible
leaders who, being nationally irresponsible, cannot be called
to account for the consequences of the acts of the
governments they control. This at the same time constitutes
the inherent weakness of any form of government, the
apotheosis of which is the control of both parties in the state,
right and left, radical and conservative, by the same
241

242

OCCULT THEOCRASY

forces. Then, only the puppets change while the rule of the
individuals controlling the machine continues unhindered.
Voters who wonder why their efforts have failed, wonder in
vain. As the dupes of a controlled publicity their privilege of
the vote is a farce.
If all factions in a state can be controlled from one source,
why should International Control be impracticable? Italy, if
one follows its history for the last hundred years, gives a
sequence of good illustrations of such possibilities and
affords us a chance to follow the progressive stages of
masonic centralization and imposition of Internationalism
upon nations, as conceived by Mazzini, Pike, Palmerston
and Bismarck.
International control was Mazzini's dream. His cynical
remark " We aspire to corrupt in order to rule " leaves one
little faith in the idealism of this Patriarch of International
Freemasonry. That he applied his motto is shown by the use
he made of Francesco Crispi.
As Palamenghi-Crispi writes : 1
" Crispi became personally acquainted with Mazzini in
London, in January, 1855, but they had corresponded since
1850, when, their golden dream of liberty and independence
banished by the return of all the tyranny of the past, the
bravest of the patriots had once more begun to conspire.
" While pondering the idea of founding a National
Committee in which the various regions of Italy should be
represented, Mazzini also determined to form a fund for the
carrying out of great enterprises. And ' as it is impossible to
obtain large sums secretly and from a few people ' he wrote,
he worked out a plan for
1. Thomas Palamenghi-Crispi, The Memoirs of Francesco
Crispi, vol. I, p. 75.

PRACTICAL POLITICS

243

a National Loan, to be raised by the issue of bonds to be
redeemed by a liberated Italy.
" The first act of the National Committee was to authorise
the issue of such bonds to the amount of ten million lire. "
In his youth, Francesco Crispi made a mistake, and
blackmail made him a ruler of men. As the tool of Mazzini,
he ruled Italy for many years, and as the ruler of Italy, he
wielded the secret power of International Masonry in
accordance with the policy of his masters.
According to Crispi 33° by D. Vaughan, " Crispi, in
Palladism, Brother v Serafino-Chiocciola, was born at Ribera,
in Sicily, on Oct. 4, 1819. His father, Tommaso Crispi, a
lawyer, destined him to the church, but in 1837, he married
Felicita Valle, a pretty young girl with whom he was
infatuated. In 1856, he abandoned her for Rosalia
Montmasson, deserting the latter in 1878 to marry Lina
Barbagallo, widow Capellani. At this period, he was openly
accused of bigamy and though challenged to do so, he never
produced the documents necessary to prove the death of his
first wife, Felicita Valle.
" After his marriage in 1837, he practised law and in 1838
joined one of the numerous secret societies which in those
days infested Sicily. Presently he started his career as a
political intriguer and conspirator travelling over the world on
his sinister business under different aliases and false
passports provided for him by Mazzini, who, in view of his
confidential position as friend of the King of Naples, had
bought his services as a spy. "
Domenico Margiotta states in Francesco Crispi, son
(Euvre Nefaste, that he found among the papers of his
grandfather — a member of Young Italy who had been
condemned to death as the head of the conspiracy,

244

OCCULT THEOCRASY

which penalty he however successfully escaped — a
telegram from Mazzini, instructing the organization to " give
Crispi promptly thirty thousand ducats to begin with on the
account of the Neapolitan Committee of Young Italy and let
him get to work. "
"While at Malta in 1855, he joined the masonic lodge, "
Zetland", under English jurisdiction from which he was
shortly expelled for the theft of 800 francs from one of its
members. He went to London shortly afterwards. There, Lord
Palmerston had returned to power. By becoming an ardent
admirer and fanatical follower of Mazzini, Crispi
simultaneously entered the good graces of Palmerston who
was on the very best of terms with the Italian leader.
In 1856, believing that Napoleon III, in cooperation with
Cavour, was the secret arbiter of the destinies of Italy, and the
greatest obstacle to the realization of his own republican
schemes, Mazzini induced Crispi to go to Paris.
While he was there, a number of attempts were made on the
life of the Emperor, among others that of Orsini on Jan. 14,
1858, but, though strongly suspected of participation in these
conspiracies by the police or Paris, no evidence for a direct
charge of complicity against Crispi was ever obtained.
However, it is known that he and Orsini had previously met in
London where the latter had shown him how to make the
famous bombs, the use and manufacture of which Crispi
afterwards taught his followers in Sicily.
By August 3, 1858, he was back in London, the Paris
police having developed too great a zeal on his behalf during
his sojourn in the French capital.
At last by 1860, the various Italian conspiracies
crystallized into one. Everything was ready for the fulfilment
of Mazzini's dream of United Italy. Bertani,

Bixio and Crispi decided to go to Turin themselves to see
General Garibaldi and, after the British Minister, Sir James
Hudson, had confirmed certain information on conditions in
Palermo, which had been furnished by the Genoese deputies,
the General seemed at last inclined to take action. He ordered
Bixio to Genoa to charter a ship and Crispi to Milan to
receive from Enrico Besana the arms and the money already
subscribed. This subscription was begun by General
Garibaldi himself and, in view of later developments, it is a
significant fact that one of the contributions he received for
the famous expedition of the One Thousand, was the sum of
fifty thousand francs from the Jew, Cornelius Herz.
Twelve thousand guns were in the hands of Massimo
d'Azeglio, then governor of Milan who, by order of the
government, surrendered them to the rebels.
Finally, General Garibaldi arrived in Genoa on April 14.
On the 16th, Crispi returned to Turin where he saw the
Minister of the Interior, Farini, who, having by that time
changed his mind concerning the Italian expedition, had
ceased to be a dictator and had assumed the attitude of a
diplomatic satellite of Cavour. He proved quite intractable.
Back in Genoa, Crispi found La Farina again, this time with
orders to report all developments to Cavour. Cavour, warned
not to interfere with Garibaldi, raised no obstacles to the
progress of the plot. He only advised waiting for better news
from the Island of Sicily, and promised to cooperate with a
million guns, as soon as the time for the expedition seemed
propitious.
Still Garibaldi hesitated. The Sicilian news was contradictory. On April 26, Crispi received from Niccola
Fabrizzi a message from Malta reading " Failure in the
provinces and in the town of Palermo. Many exiles

arriving at Malta on English ships. " Luckily a few days later,
a communication from Palermo, published by the Gazette of
Turin, told of the great proportions assumed by the
insurrection in Sicily, This communication had been invented
and written at Genoa by Crispi for the purposes of
overcoming the last scruples of Garibaldi !
One day, the second of May, Crispi and Garibaldi were
alone in a room looking seaward, in the Villa Spinola Quarti.
They were talking about the expedition. Crispi as usual, was
fighting the vacillations of Garibaldi. Suddenly, the General
interrupted him saying, " You are the only one to encourage
me in this enterprise, Everyone else tries to dissuade me.
Why ?"
"Because I am profoundly convinced that it will be helpful
to the fatherland and that it will cover you with glory. I fear
only one thing : The uncertainty of the sea. "
" I answer for the sea " said Garibaldi.
" And I answer for the land " said Crispi.
Garibaldi was persuaded and the die was cast.
After the victorious expedition of the One Thousand had
placed the group of conspirators in power in Sicily, each was
rewarded according to his merits, Crispi becoming Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Cavour had died on June 6, 1861,
poisoned, it is said, on May 28, by order of Mazzini.
Until 1861, Crispi had cooperated whole heart-1 edly with
the revolutionaries but, as time wore on, he began to think
that it might be more to his personal advantage to serve the
King than Mazzini.
His plan was discovered by Mazzini's spies and in 1862,
the deputy of Castelvetrano found himself facing death for
treason at the hands of his former friends and accomplices,
under conditions that enslaved him

body and soul forever after, to the International Sect.
Early in April 1862, he attended a Freemasonic dinner of
the Associations Emancipatrice at Turin. Suddenly he felt ill,
very ill, fire seemed to be burning within him. He was in the
throes of the most appalling agony. Instead of offering
assistance, the other guests began to laugh, then, one of them
rising, spoke to him severely in the following terms :
" Francesco, you went to visit King Victor Emmanuel,
without telling us of your intention and you offered him your
secret services. You let him know that you were ready to go
over at the first opportunity. Till then your opinions had been
republican. Well, that is treason. We have condemned you.
You are poisoned. You are a dead man. "
The poison had indeed been administered in the bread.
Among the organizers of the banquet was the baker Dolfi,
who had formerly contributed to the expulsion of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany and who had become one of the members of
the Radical Directing Committee. On this occasion, Dolfi had
kneaded the bread himself, and each guest had found his
place at the table marked by a small roll bearing his name,
traced on its golden crust by a fillet of whitish dough. All the
guests, agreeably surprised, had congratulated the baker for
his delicate attention, but the piece of bread marked Crispi
had been separately kneaded and contained the poison.
Crispi realized full well that he was lost. He knew there
was no escape and that all the exits to the banquet hall were
closed, moreover, he was too weak to tight. Without
recrimination and in the throes of acute pain, he dropped into
a chair upon which, writhing in agony, he awaited a
lingering death.
The others surrounded him, watching him in silence

248

OCCULT THEOCRASY

with profound contempt. Suddenly, a door opened, a curtain
was raised and a man appeared. He advanced slowly. It was
Mazzini.
" Poor wretch ! " said he to the dying man. " I pity you. "
At these words, Crispi looked up. His dim eyes gleamed
suddenly and he murmured feebly.
" Yes, ambition made me betray... It is true ... I was going
to sell myself... But I die... Do not insult my agony... Do not
mock me... 1 suffer too much ! "
" I do not speak to you in derision, " answered the grand
master, " Francesco Crispi, I forgive you... Drink this and you
are saved. You will be reborn... "
So saying, he forced his teeth apart and pressing a small
vial to the lips of the dying man poured the counter-poison
down his parched throat.
After his last words, Crispi had collapsed. Some time
passed. Was he still alive ? He seemed a corpse. Little by
little, sweat gathered on his face and hands then, slowly, his
livid countenance regained some colour.
For a long time he seemed inert. Then his eyelids opened
and, looking around with a stunned expression of
incomprehension, he asked.
" Where am I ? "
" You have returned from the realm of the dead "
murmured Mazzini gravely.
" Oh ! Yes, I remember now, Mercy ! Mercy ! " he added
suddenly, recalling realities and clinging desperately to life. "
I live indeed, Master. Is it not a dream ? "
"You live, yes, Francesco; but henceforth you are more
completely enslaved than the last of the negroes for whose
freedom they are fighting over there in America... You live
again and your ambition will be gratified... You will be
minister, minister of the Monarchy ;

PRACTICAL POLITICS

249

You will hold in your hands the reins of government but,
without betraying us, without selling yourself !... You will
part from us, not privately but publicly... We will denounce
you, and while denouncing you, we will push you to power. It
is the monarchy that you will betray by executing our orders,
when we shall have made you minister of the crown... And
you will obey us in all things, even should the orders we give
you seem contradictory, even should their execution cause
you to pass for a madman in the eyes of Europe ! Yes,
Francesco Crispi, from this day forward, you belong to us, for
you must never forget that, should you place us in a position
where it might be expedient to cut short your own existence a
second time, no power in the world could save you from the
death, the sufferings of which you have known today. Live
then for Masonry. Fight Royalty and the Church. You will be
the gravedigger of this house of Savoy. It is only an
instrument for us and we have condemned it to disappear
after it has served our purpose. "
This plan of action was carried out. In 1864, Crispi, on
orders from his master, became a Royalist and duly
denounced Mazzini. That is the explanation of his often
incoherent and erratic policies in after life. Maz-1 zini's
promise was fulfilled and Crispi became Minister of the
Interior in 1878.
In 1877, he had been on a tour to Paris, Berlin, London and
Vienna. In Paris, he had seen Thiers, Jules Favre and
Gambetta; in Germany, Prince Bismarck, with whom he
already had an acquaintance of some years standing, and who
shared his aversion for France and the Roman Catholic
Church ; in England, Lord Derby and Mr. Gladstone ; but the
true purpose of his mission in these lands is still unknown. As
a consequence of his interview with Bismarck, at Salzbourg,
Italy, fearing

250

OCCULT THEOCRASY

France, threw herself into the hands of the Iron Chancellor.
Germany henceforth was to hold her as a dog ready to be set
at either against Austria or France when it suited her purpose.
The Triple Alliance was formed on May 20, 1882.
Crispi's accession to the ministry was therefore a victory of
prime importance to the sect.
After the death of Mazzini, in 1872, Adriano Lemmi took
over his masonic heritage and, along with the rest, his slave
Francesco Crispi, who, with the Jew Baro-zilai, became his
right hand man.
King Victor Emmanuel died on Jan 9, 1878, and was
succeeded by Humbert I. That same year saw the death of
Pope Pius IX and the accession to the papacy of Leo XIII.
In 1884, Humbert I was initiated into masonry as Knight
Kadosch, under conditions of the greatest secrecy and a lodge,
that of Savoia Illuminata, was founded in his honour.
In spite of his exalted masonic position the monarch's
political information was always strictly censored by his
masonic superiors.
From 1887 to 1891, and again from 1893 to 1896, Crispi
acted the part of Prime Minister.
In order to enable him to curry favour with the common
people, Lemmi occasionally authorized him to execute
political turnovers. The Grand Master Lemmi once said to
Humbert " Fear not; The socialism of Crispi will not last; it
will provoke no riots, it is simply an electoral manoeuvre "
and the king was much gratified at being so well informed.
There at least, the 33° King was not deceived. If now and
again Crispi resumed his revolutionary complexion, it was
only to obtain the votes of those whom he persecuted
mercilessly once he had obtained power. To him, a

PRACTICAL POLITICS

251

change of opinion was as easy as a change of shirt. 2
In 1889, came the scandal of the Banca Romana, revealed
as such through the efforts of Giovanni Gio-' litti 3 and in 1892,
that of Panama involving another, namely the Grand Cordon
of Cornelius Herz, any one of which would have swamped
the political career of any unprotected individual. Crispi,
though seriously implicated, was supported through an
impossible situation by the masonic brotherhood.
The Abyssinian War, itself the result of masonic intrigue,
was the terrible manoeuvre calculated to ruin the House of
Savoy in the eyes of the Italian people.
It was known that, at the time of the disaster of Adowa, the
succession of Adriano Lemmi to the Grand Mastership of the
Grand Orient of Italy was open, and that competition for the
position was keen. Some favoured the candidacy of Bovio,
others that of Nathan, later Mayor of Rome. But Crispi had
promised General Baratieri, 4 a masonic dignitary, that he
should have the preference above all others, on condition that
he win a victory over the Negus. Such an achievement would
give Italy another Garibaldi, a popular hero, while
simultaneously providing Crispi himself with a useful tool
and the position of " top dog " which had never been his
before.
But the disastrous defeat of his candidate by Mene-1 lek, at
the Battle of Adowa on March 2, 1896, resulted in the fall of
Crispi, not that of the king.
The agent of Lemmi had played his part but the great game
of the Federated Secret Societies had only suffered a
temporary setback.

In 1900, King Humbert I was assassinated at Monza.

The fate of Italy is the fate of all nations governed by
political rings. Italy in the 19th century seems to have been
the vortex of the intrigue directed against Christianity which
today ravages the world, carrying in its wake a general
disregard of all ideals, decency, duty and loyalty.
Liberty is corrupted into licentiousness, marital fidelity
into perversion, equality into equality of low standards and
fraternity into a brotherhood based on mutual slavery under
the yoke of International Finance.
And the monster grows apace! Today it bestrides the world
under the name of Bolshevism, but it is the same old monster,
the heresy of the first centuries of the Christian era and the
Middle Ages, namely — Gnosticism.

CHAPTER

XXXII

ADRIANO LEMMI
This Chapter is compiled largely of extracts, some
transcribed verbatim and others elaborated to include
information necessary to the reader, from :
Adriano Lemmi
by Domenico Margiotta 33°
Adriano Lemmi was born of Roman Catholic parents, at
Leghorn, Tuscany, on April 30, 1822. He was the son of
Fortunato Lemmi and Teresa Merlino, his lawful wife.
At an early age, he became the despair of his parents. He
was dissolute, frequented evil haunts and formed undesirable
friendships.
Running away from home on December 29, 1843, he
forged a letter stating, under the letterhead of Falconet and
Co., that a credit for his account was to be opened on Pastre
Bros., Bankers, at Marseilles, where, shortly after his arrival,
he scraped acquaintance with Monsieur and Madame Grand
Boubagne whom he was soon accused of having robbed of
300 francs. The evidence against him was overwhelming,
and he was condemned to a year in prison for that and other
minor offences, and also sentenced to five years on
probation.
253

He served his term and bolted to Constantinople, Arriving
there early in April 1845, he eked out a precarious existence,
first as a kitchen hand, then as the assistant in the shop of an
old apothecary, whose preparations he peddled in the streets
of Galata.
His employer had a friend, a Polish rabbi who, having been
condemned for conspiracy in Russia, had taken refuge in
Constantinople. This man took a fancy to him and in an effort
to curry favour with the Jews, Lemmi presently asked if he
might be received into the religion of Moses. As a diplomatic
move, the suggestion was a great success for the apothecary
and the rabbi, proud and jubilant to have secured a neophyte,
taught him the Talmud, while another rabbi, Abraham
Maggioro, instructed him in the mysteries of the Cabala.
Together, they initiated him into the secrets of magic, in
which he proved an apt pupil and his lot was much improved,
but the old apothecary died in 1847, and Lemmi found
himself without employment. The Polish rabbi having left
Constantinople, he stayed on a while under the protection of
his friend Maggioro.
In those days, the few Freemasons coming to Pera were
English. Freemasonry had been introduced into Turkey in
1738, but until the Crimean war it suffered many vicissitudes.
The English saw their lodges fade away for want of active
members, for the government did not favour them. Adriano
Lemmi was supposed to have been initiated into
Freemasonry in 1848 by an English Mason, but this
ceremony seems to have somehow been irregular as it had to
be repeated at a later date.
Finally, the era of his trials seemed to end. In 1849, some
of his English masonic friends gave him a letter of
introduction to the great Magyar, Kossuth, who

ADRIANO LEMMI

255

had come to Constantinople, a fugitive from public
opprobrium in his own country.
To save him from starvation, Kossuth took him as his
servant at low wages, but he gradually succeeded in
ingratiating himself with his patron till finally he became his
secretary on the recommendation of Mazzini with whom he
was already in correspondence.
When Kossuth went to the United States in 1851, he was
accompanied by Lemmi. They were forced to travel via
Gibraltar and London as the French authorities refused
Kossuth permission to land in France, and Lemmi, knowing
that he was wanted by the French police, knew better than to
try to do so. In Lodge No. 133 in Cincinnati, U. S. A.,
Kossuth received the masonic initiation.
On the 2nd of December 1851, Prince Louis Napoleon,
then President of the French Republic, announced to the
people and the army his intention of submitting to a
referendum the plan of a constitution founded on the system
favoured by his uncle. It was a Coup d'Etat. At this news
Lemmi left Kossuth in America and went to join Mazzini and
Ledru Rollin in London.
By this time, Mazzini had already established his
reputation as an international intriguer. The " Youth
Movement" of the day was already organized : —
The societies composing it were : —
Young Italy — founded by Mazzini ................................1831
Young Poland — founded by Simon Konarski.... 1834
Young England — founded by Benjamin Disraeli______1834
Young Europe — founded by Mazzini ............................. 1834
Young Switzerland — founded by Melegari (Emery).. 1835
Young Ireland — founded by Smith O'Brien .................. 1843
Young Germany — founded by Hecker & Struve.... 1848

The oath taker, by the members of Young Italy reads as
follows : 1
" In the name of God and of Italy — in the name of all the
martyrs of the holy Italian cause, who have fallen beneath
foreign and domestic tyranny — by the duties which bind me
to the land wherein God has placed me, and to the brothers
whom God has given me — by the love, innate in all men, I
bear to the country that gave my mother birth, and will be the
home of my children — by the hatred, innate in all men, I bear
to evil, injustice, usurpation, and arbitrary rule — by the blush
that rises to my brow when I stand before the citizens of other
lands, to know that I have no rights of citizenship, no country,
and no national flag — by the aspiration that thrills my soul
towards that liberty for which it was created, and is impotent
to exert ; towards the good it was created to strive after, and is
impotent to achieve in the silence and isolation of slavery —
by the memory of our former greatness and the sense of our
present degradation — by the tears of Italian mothers for their
sons dead on the scaffold, in prison, or in exile — by the
sufferings of the millions —
"I--------- , believing in the mission entrusted by God
to Italy, and the duty of every Italian to strive to attempt its
fulfilment — convinced that where God has ordained that a
nation shall be, he has given the requisite power to create it;
that the people are the depositaries of that power, and that in
its right direction, for the people, and by the people, lies the
secret of victory — convinced that virtue consists in action
and sacrifice, and strength in union and constancy of

Revolution (1776-1876), vol. 2, p. 147.

purpose — I give my name to Young Italy, an association of
men holding the same faith, and swear —
" To dedicate myself wholly and for ever to the endeavour
with them to constitute Italy one free, independent,
Republican nation — to promote, by every means in my
power, whether by written or spoken word, or by action, the
education of my Italian brothers towards the aim of Young
Italy ; towards association, the sole means of its
accomplishment; and to virtue, which alone can render the
conquest lasting — to abstain from enrolling myself in any
other association from this time forth — to obey all the
instructions, in conformity with the spirit of Young Italy,
given me by those who represent with me the union of my
Italian brothers, and to keep the secret of these instructions,
even at the cost of my life — to assist my brothers of the
Association both by action and counsel —
" NOW AND FOR EVER !

" This do I swear, invoking upon my head the wrath of God,
the abhorrence of man, and the infamy of the perjurer, if I
ever betray the whole or a part of this my oath. "
The fusion of Young Italy and Carbonarism evidently did
not take place till after April 8, 1839, for in a letter of that date,
Mazzini writes to L. A. Melegari at Lausanne " It is a mixture
of Young Italy and Carbonarism. They have had me
approached indirectly to know if I accept the fusion. " l
After 1851, Lemmi began playing an important part in all
politico-masonic assassinations and in all the popular
insurrections of which Italy was the scene. On behalf of
Mazzini, he kept up relations with the revolu1.

tionaries of Tuscany and it was he who inspired the attempt to
assassinate the councillor of the Grand Duke's minister,
Baldasseroni, in broad daylight, on Oct. 21, 1852.
A letter from which we quote, written from Malta by
Francesco Crispi to Mazzini, dated Nov. 13, 1853, 2 gives a
most interesting sidelight on the relations then existing
between the Great Italian Revolutionary, his ally Crispi and
Adriano Lemmi whom Crispi already recognizes as the agent
of an organization inimical to his ideals.
" Brother, — the die is cast! At the present moment, an
uprising in Sicily is imminent, if, indeed, it has not already
taken place. God grant it may not prove a second sixth of
February !
" Knowing that I was here you should have forewarned me.
Those to whom you have seen fit to entrust the initiative will
not be able to exert any influence whatsoever in the provinces
of Palermo and Messina ! their names, indeed, may even be
greeted there with hostility, and bring about a reaction. Now
without Palermo and Messina every attempt in Sicily will
prove vain. But what is done is done, and our plain duty now
is to work together in helping on the undertaking, and, as far
as is possible, in warding oif evil consequences. Let me know
the plan of action and what orders you have issued to the
leaders. Although I have little regard for them, I intend to do
my duty, and this for the good of our country and party, upon
whose already tarnished reputation another failure would
bring utter ruin. You will remember that ever since 1850, I
have been ready to hasten to Sicily. At that time we were

to form the National Committee and raise the loan that should
provide funds for any great emergency. Then the Sicilian
Committee was formed and speedily dissolved, while you
worked to prepare an uprising in northern and central Italy,
forgetting Sicily entirely. But not so my friends and I, who
were convinced that the greatest possibility of success lav in
this island. Nor was this all. After your misfortunes in
Lombardy you forgot your old friends, and flung yourself into
the arms of men who, up to that very moment, had held you
and your theories up to ridicule, but who had been clever
enough to deceive you through Signor Lemmi, to whom they
had declared their intention to act.
" I am no more their enemy than are any of the friends who
belong to the party opposed to Calvi. "
On February 6, 1853, an incipient insurrection broke out in
Milan, then under Austrian dominion, as the result of a
proclamation signed by Mazzini and Kossuth. That it was
sent by Lemmi from Switzerland to the revolutionary
Lombards is a fact well known in Italian masonry.
Though implicated, the Swiss and Piedmontese
governments tried to appear unconcerned. Numerous
refugees from Northern Italy went to Switzerland or
Piedmont following the instructions transmitted by Lemmi.
Piedmont, assisted by England, (who was secretly helping
Mazzini's masonry) tried to induce the Emperor of Austria to
issue a decree confiscating the properties of the revolutionary
refugees, but a bloody protest was made against the measure
on the 18th of February when, by order of Kossuth and
Mazzini a revolutionary fanatic made ari attempt against the
life of the Emperor. Lemmi was chosen to arm the assassin
who was

260

OCCULT THEOCRASY

a Hungarian and a mutual friend of both Kossuth and
himself.
Switzerland, under threat of severance of diplomatic
relations, was then obliged to banish indiscriminately all
political refugees.
Then came the Crimean war, the real causes of which were
known only to the chiefs of Freemasonry.
England and Piedmont worked up a quarrel with Russia
about Turkey, over the respective spheres of influence of the
Christian Greek and Catholic churches at Jerusalem. This
rivalry was of little real consequence either to England or
Piedmont but it served to turn France against Russia on the
pretext of protecting Turkey.
The truth was that for a long time, long before the
Hungarian insurrection of Kossuth, the secret chiefs of
masonry, headed by Lord Palmerston, had made a plan
according to which Prussia was to be exalted at the expense
of Austria, German unity was to be achieved to the advantage
of the Prussian monarchy, as well as that of Italy to the
benefit of the house of Savoy, and a Polish Magyar state was
to be created.3
Fearing that the Hungarian insurrection might spread to his
Polish provinces, a community of monarchic interests had
impelled the Tsar to reach an understanding with the Austrian
Emperor which had helped to hinder the success of the
Magyar revolutionaries. Until this " Entente " could be
broken up, the masonic
3. It is a curious fact that the book from which the above is
translated was written in 1894 and that these points were
actually achieved in 1919 at the Treaty of Versailles. The
machinery which the German monarchical power thought it
was using for its own ends, was already, in reality, being
guided by the unseen Jewish power controlling Freemasonry.

ADRIANO LEMMI

261

chiefs knew that German and Italian Unity would remain a
dream.
Austria was the dupe in this war. As for France, she had to
fight with the army of Piedmont so as to prepare public
opinion in both countries for the next move against Austria.
All this had been combined by Lord Palmerston who knew
how to get his way with all the other secret chiefs, not
excepting Mazzini. Kossuth naturally favoured the masonic
programme. He wished death to the Tsar for having caused
him to lose his position in Hungary. It is also easy to
understand how Napoleon III was drawn into the affair. The
chiefs of the sect only had to remind him of his oath as
Carbonaro and show him the laurels to be won.
" Mazzini and Kossuth urged on the Crimean war, and
English diplomacy prevented Austria from joining Russia.
From then on, that power, being opposed by France, England,
Piedmont and Turkey, faced inevitable defeat, which
happened after a war lasting two years. Austria was separated
for ever from Russia and was punished for her ingratitude,
for, without even waiting for the end of hostilities, the Mason
chiefs, who had used her so successfully, started the work of
revolution on her territory. 4
This war served a great purpose for Adriano Lemmi. It
enabled him to get rich.
Through his relations with Mazzini and Kossuth, he
obtained contracts for Italian ambulances for the Crimea.
These he sent from Geneva. Pocketing a large part of the
money, he paid the rest with bad chequees and fled to Malta.
This was his first big theft, but his flight did not prevent him
and his two accomplices from
4. Margiotta, Adriano Lemmi, p. 18.

262

being condemned by default by the Swiss judge.
" On Jan. 4, 1855, Mazzini, chief of the Central European
Committee, —• the title Mazzini assumed as leader of '
Young Europe ' — called a meeting of his accomplices in
London at which F.\ Fe Pyat, the president of the branch
group known as the Communist Revolutionaries, was present.
These two committees were in correspondence with one in
Brussels, one in Jersey and one in Geneva. At this meeting,
the death of Charles III, Duke of Parma, was unanimously
voted, and Mazzini sent Lemmi a passport in the name of '
Lewis Broom ' under the protection of which he immediately
left Malta for the Duchy of Parma. During the one day he
spent there, he organized a secret meeting at Castel-Guelfo
for March 25, during which lots were drawn and a man called
Antonio Carra was thus duly selected by fate to do the deed.
Lessons in stabbing were then given on a dummy and
Adriano, who presided at the assembly, adressing the
assassin-elect said " This day is the feast of the Jesuits and
nuns when they celebrate the apparition to their Madonna of
an angel announcing the advent of the Messiah as her son.
Brother, I announce to thee that thou wilt be the Messiah of
the Revolution of Parma. I consecrate thee liberator of the
oppressed, saviour of tyrannized men. Strike the despot! Let
not thy hand falter. Our God, who is not the God of the priests,
will protect thee ! "
Two days later, Charles III fell under the attack of an
alleged fanatic who made good his escape. The circumstances
of the plot are known because Lemmi often boasted of the
part he played in it to Frapolli and others who repeated the
story.
Mazzini often acknowledged that his " little Jew " was
worth ten good men, so clever was he at choosing

ADRIANO LEMMI

263

the right men for important jobs, and so able at inspiring them
with the energy necessary for doing their
duty.
The Parma business greatly enhanced the value of
Lemmi in the eyes of the principal chiefs. He remained
incognito for several days at SantTlario, but the revolution
did not come off, for the crime was received by the people
with horror, and the widow of Charles III, the daughter of the
Due de Berry, was proclaimed regent for her son Robert, a
child of six.
Still under the false name of Lewis Broom, Lemmi went to
Reggio, then to Modena, returning to the duchy of Parma in
the last days of June, where he prepared the abortive
insurrection of July 22, which was quickly suppressed.
In January, 1855, the Piedmontese government suppressed
334 religious institutions at the instigation of the
revolutionary societies which, thanks to complicity under the
guise of tolerance, were unhindered in the development of
their criminal resources.
Lemmi, who had at his disposal as many false papers as
might be necessary for his secret missions, again changed his
name. Armed with a Hungarian passport, belonging to one of
the henchmen of Kossuth, he went to Rome under the name of
" Ulrick Putsch ", professional cook, and on June 12 there was
an attempt to kill Cardinal Antonelli! He immediately
reappeared at Genoa where, on the thirteenth of the month, a
manifesto was published by Mazzini, inciting the people "to
insurrection. This was spread by Lemmi in several towns,
notably even in Rome where, by a curious coincidence, on
July 9, the same day on which he returned to the city of the
popes, an attempt was made on the life of Father Beckx, the
General of the Jesuits.
In all these movements, in all these crimes where

264

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Lemmi's hand is not visible, those of his associates always
were.
Lemmi and Orsini — the latter also an agent of Mazzini,
had transmitted to the revolutionary committee of Milan their
chiefs instructions in view of an imminent uprising. Having
received their instructions, Lemmi went to Switzerland with
his Hungarian passport, and Orsini, under the name of George
Her-1 nash, went to Austria where an insurrection, timed to
occur simultaneously with that in Lombardy, was to be
fomented. Orsini was arrested at Hermanstadt, in
Transsylvania, brought back to Vienna and transferred to
Mantua where he was judged and condemned to death for
high treason on August 20, 1855.
Locked up in the castle of San Giorgio, he succeeded in
escaping on the night of March 29th, 1856.
On November 13 of the same year, two other agents of
Mazzini were taken at Rome.
Under the pretext that the King of Naples was not
observing strict neutrality towards Russia, Lord Pal-merston
obtained the disgrace of Mazza, the Neapolitan Director of
Police. In this move, he was aided by Mazzini, who, having
caused certain confidential papers to be stolen, knew some
things that were none of his business. Mazza, devoted to the
King, had been his protector against the machinations of the
secret societies.
Napoleon III, too, allowed himself to be influenced by
Palmerston who, as patriarch of European Freemasonry,
favoured one of his pet projects. This involved the
appointment of Prince Murat, Grand Master of the Grand
Orient of France, to the throne of Naples and the two Sicilies,
and the elimination of the house of Bourbon. England and
France presently threatened to send a squadron to Naples but
owing to the protest of Russia, the threat was never carried
out.

In September, "1856, the European Committee decided
that the King of Naples should be assassinated and that at the
same time there should be an insurrection in Sicily. A man
named Baron de Bentivegna, who had been introduced by an
English high mason, Henri Misley, to Mazzini in London,
was entrusted with the task of fomenting the trouble, while
Lemmi took charge of the murder. According to the plan,
Ferdinand II was to be blown up by a bomb thrown under his
carriage by some fanatic selected by Lemmi.
Armed with two bombs, Lemmi went to Sicily. He now
travelled under a French passport, provided for him by a
friend through Ledru-Rollin, and made out under the name
of " Jacques Lathuile ", merchant.
Everything was ready both in Palermo and Naples. The
dates of the assassination of the king and the outbreak of the
revolution were fixed for November 22, but the individual
chosen to perform the deed, Filippo Carabi, suddenly lost
interest in the project when he realized that the bomb
destined for the king would also inevitably prove fatal to
himself.
Lemmi was angry over this unexpected check. It was then
too late to recruit another executioner but the disobedient
Sicilian was eventually punished, for, five years later he was
murdered in a Neapolitan lodge where he had gone without
apprehension. The archives of the Directory of Naples
contain the details of the affair, the sequestration of Carabi in
1861, his accusation before a secret tribunal, the terrible
tortures to which he was subjected and his last horrible agony,
shrouded in mystery.
Lemmi, now unable to have the assassination and the plot
coincide, stayed on nevertheless in Naples, as he hoped to
find a substitute for the defaulting murderer.

On the appointed day, November 22, Bentivegna raised
the banner of revolt at Cefalu, near Palermo.
" Jacques Lathuile ", finding himself obliged to substitute
another for the bomb method of assassination, induced a
soldier called Agesilas Milano to attempt the life of the king,
so, while Ferdinand II was reviewing his troops, Milano
stepped forward and struck him twice in the chest with his
bayonet. Luckily for the king, the instrument bent, failing
even to wound him. Milano was arrested, judged and shot, but
Mazzini, qualifying him as a martyr, had a commemoration
medal struck in his honour.
As for the insurrection in Sicily, it was suppressed,
Bentivegna was captured and shot on December 20, but
Lemmi-Lathuile left the country as soon as he realized that
things were not going well. His identity was never revealed
and can today only be definitely established by the records of
the secret masonic trial of Filippo Carabi in the archives of the
Directory of Naples.
In 1857, a splendid farce was enacted by Piedmont. It has
since been repeatedly proved that Cavour and Rattazzi were
in agreement with the Mazzinians and the Garibaldians with
regard to the scheme for a United Italy, under the house of
Savoy — that is to say, they favoured the dispossession of the
legitimate sovereigns of the duchies of Tuscany, Parma,
Modena, the Papal States and the Kingdom of the two Sicilies,
and the wresting of Lombardy and Venice from Austria. In
the eyes of the European monarchs who were not in the secret,
Piedmont wished to appear innocent of any connivance in the
plot, and to have been forced only reluctantly to acquiesce.

Isaac Artom, 5 while l'Olper, later rabbi of Turin and also the
friend and counsellor of Mazzini, was one of the most open
advocates of Italian Independence.
A few Freemasons in English, French and Prussian
diplomacy alone knew what was being plotted, so the
International Committee of London decreed an upheaval in
Tuscany for the year 1857 and, in order that Piedmont might
not be suspected of complicity, it -was arranged that an
insurrection should be staged in that kingdom at the same
time as the one in Tuscany. That was the comedy !
The insurrection occurred but failed in its object.
In London, the same year, Mazzini hatched a plot against
Napoleon III. It was not the first.
As the French Emperor did not seem sufficiently active on
behalf of Italian Unity, it was decided to stimulate him by
terror. Mazzini, Kossuth and Ledru-Rollin were reinforced in
the committee of London by Herzen, Bakunin, Turr and
Klapka and, early in the year 1857, Paolo Tibaldi, Giuseppe
Bartolotti and Paolo Grilli were chosen by Mazzini and
Ledru-Rollin to kill Napoleon. Massarenti, another tool of
Mazzini's, gave them fifty golden Napoleons when they left
for Paris to perpetrate the crime and, addressing them before
their departure, Mazzini said " You will study the habits of the
Emperor and you will strike when you find the opportunity
favorable. " Massarenti, Campa-nella, Tibaldi, Grilli and
Bartolotti, the active tools of the plot, were all personal
friends of Lemmi. To quote the words of the Imperial
Attorney at the hearing of the Court of Assizes at Paris,
August 7, 1857, when Grilli was sentenced to deportation,

Rollin were the chiefs of all plots the object of which was
assassination.
On January 14, 1858, at the door of the Opera House in
Paris, another attempt was made on the life of the French
Emperor. Three bombs killed eight and wounded 156 persons.
Some of the guilty were arrested but others, among whom was
our hero, Adriano Lemmi, now masquerading under the name
of James Mac-Gregor, escaped. Lemmi had come to Paris
ostensibly to visit Giuseppe Mazzoni, his Tuscan compatriot,
then professor of languages in the French capital. Orsini, who
had taken the pseudonym of Alsop on reaching Paris, Pierri,
and Rudio the principal actors in the drama were caught and
condemned to death. The first two were executed, Rudio's
sentence being commuted to hard labour for life. Orsini was
not unknown to Napoleon III. Together, they had belonged to
the Lodge of Cesna as members of the Carbonari. In 1874 the
Giornale di Firenze published the account of Napoleon's visit
to his imprisoned assassin who warned him that, unless he
showed a disposition to help the Unity of Italy, other bombs
were reserved for him. Napoleon acquiesced, and one saw the
famous will of Felice Orsini published by the Imperial official
journal which enabled the French deputy Monsieur Keller to
remark before the legislative body on March 13, 1861, that
"the Italian war was the execution of the will of Orsini. "
We must here be permitted a somewhat lengthy digression
unfolding the progress of political corruption and its affinity
with secret societies.
As a result of the Orsini conspiracy, Palmerston sponsored
" The Conspiracy to Murder " Bill, a measure framed to
hamper International Assassins in the free use of English
territory for hatching plots against

ADRIANO LEMMI

269

foreign potentates. The Bill passed its first reading in
Parliament, Disraeli voting for it, but at the second reading,
Milner Gibson, a Radical, moved an amendment which was
in effect a vote of censure on Palmers-ton and a challenge to
the French. " This was eventually carried by 19 votes,
Disraeli's support being, of course, the decisive factor. An
explanation of this change of front is afforded in Ashley's Life
of Lord Palmerston. Seated in the Peers' Gallery, Lord Derby
listened to the debate, and watched the tide rising against the
Prime Minister. Convinced that he could be overthrown, he "
sent hasty word to his lieutenant that they should take it at the
flood which led to office, " and thereupon Disraeli " plunged
into the stream. " 6
Lord Palmerston fell and was succeeded by Lord Darby.
Where does Disraeli — Lord Beaconsfield — come into
the scheme ? We know him as the author of many novels that,
while not being evidential, serve to show the knowledge of
their author on subjects of International significance: He
knew how things were done and, like a naughty boy, told
tales out of school.
Young Italy, Young Ireland, lastly Young England with
Disraeli as its founder. What do we really know of Young
England beyond what the Primrose League would have us
think ?
We know that Disraeli was always in debt, always short of
money and we know that people under such conditions are
seldom their own masters. Who were his masters ?
Disraeli's father, Isaac d'lsraeli, was offered the leadership
of their sect by the Jews of London. He refused. Was it also
offered to his son ?

Writing of Lord Beaconsfield, A. A. B. passes a casual
remark in the (London) Evening Standard of Monday,
October 29, 1928 — " The name of the heroine of Lothair, the
work of his meridian, is that of his wife. Mary Anne ruled the
underworld of secret societies. " Are we to search there for
the invisible masters ?
A further light is thrown upon this epoch of English history
by no less an authority than the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th
Edition. In an article on Prince Metter-1 nich it says : —
Metternich " in one of his most earnest writings places side by
side, as instances of evil sought for its own sake, the action of
the secret societies in Germany, the Carbonaria of Italy and
the attempts of the English to carry the Reform Bill! "
We do know that the Reform Bill was one of Disraeli's
victories !
Again one wonders at Metternich. That great reactionary
might well have disliked the Reform Bill but this remark does
not just indicate dislike — it is a positive indictment when
read with the knowledge available to the historians of today.
Therein lies a singular coincidence of facts. On the one
hand, we have one of two statesmen, Metternich, decrying the
English Reform Bill and on the other, Disraeli getting it
passed in the English Parliament. Yet, both men, ever
impecunious, were ruled by money coming from the same
source, namely, the Rothschilds who, in Austria as well as in
London, were actively becoming the masters of the national
finances of both countries. 7
In 1862, the First International came into being and the
part played in it by such Freemasons as Karl

Marx, Tolain, Fribourg, Varlin, Camelinat, Beslay, Malon
and Corbon is well known.
But to return to the programme of Young Italy.
The Piedmontese were not quite satisfied with the results
of the hasty treaty of Villafranca (1859), but the
revolutionaries had attained their object as far as Tuscany, the
Duchies of Parma and Modena and the Pontifical States were
concerned, though they did not dare to dispossess the Pope
without some preliminary political manoeuvres. The
revolution in the kingdom of the two Sicilies had failed again
but it was soon to succeed.
By way of retaliation, the International Committee of
London began a propaganda in Lombardy among the students
in the colleges as a result of which the University of Pavia
was forced to close. This movement which started in
December was the precursor of the coming war. Lord
Palmerston's plan was in process of realization.
To Francesco Crispi, a tool of Lemmi, was now assigned
the task in which he and Bentivegna had failed. He was in
London when the news of the death by poison of Ferdinand II
reached the International Masonic Committee. Mazzini's tool
in the poison plot was Monsignor Caputo, a priest who had
succeeded in winning the confidence of the king as his
confessor. He was a Freemason, and a Sublime Maitre Parfait,
belonging to one of the most evil branches of the sect. The
poison was administered in a slice of melon and. the king
died in agony, on May 22, 1857.
Freemasonry had won, for Francis II, who now succeeded
his father, was too young and inexperienced to be able to cope
with any serious political situation alone.
At this period, the states of Tuscany, Parma and. Modena
were trying to form a coalition but Dr. Farini,

272

OCCULT THEOCRASY

a Freemason, had become dictator, and dictated regardless of
popular sentiment. Lemmi was continually running back and
forth from England with instructions from the London
Committee to the local revolutionary chiefs and, in his secret
capacity, was very active through the different assemblies
where the votes of the sold or terrorized members went for
annexation to Piedmont, regardless of the wishes of the
majorities in their constituencies.
Travelling under the assumed names of Emmanuel Pareda
and Toby Glivan, Crispi spent much of his time during the
next two years in Sicily as an agitator fomenting trouble. A
great uprising was planned for Oct. 12, but, though Lemmi
was there to help, their combined efforts on that date were
futile.
Still they persisted, and by propaganda and underground
work, they prepared for the great event of 1860. When
Garibaldi, Grand Master ad vitam of Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rites, at Palermo, landed at Marsala with his famous
" thousand " on the 11th May, he found everything ready. His
expedition would, however, have failed had it not been for the
Piedmontese gold which bought the chief functionaries of the
King of Naples, one of whose ministers, Liborio Romano,
was chief of Sicilian Masonry and presided at the Scottish
Consistory at Naples. Francis' friend and confidant, General
Nunziante, Due of Mignano, was bought by Cavour for four
millions !
Organized at Genoa by Dr. Bertani, this supposedly
spontaneous act of the famous general which the government
of Victor Emmanuel publicly disavowed, was organized by
Cavour who furnished the money by drafts on Mr. Bombrini,
director of the bank, as proved by a letter, written by the King
himself to the American Commodore, William de
Rohan.

June 27th 1860. Commander; I
enclose herewith Medici's [one of Garibaldi's generals] two letters
which you will put into other envelopes and give to Cavour. I have
already given three millions to Bertani. Return immediately to
Palermo to tell Garibaldi that I will send him Valerio instead of La
Farina, and that he is to advance at once on Messina, as Francesco
[the King of Naples] is on the point of giving the Neapolitans a
constitution.
Your friend,
VICTOR EMMANUEL.

This letter which was published in Rome, in 1881, by the
son of Victor Emmanuel in the Fanfulla with an article by
Commodore William de Rohan was never challenged.
Margiotta then adds — " there is little more to be said
concerning the connivance of Cavour and Garibaldi. Victor
Emmanuel did nothing against his wish as the official
newspapers allege, for everything that happened in 1860 was
settled in advance. It was necessary to save appearances and
to deceive Russian and Austrian diplomacy which was not in
the secret, so that was Cavour's reason for allowing Garibaldi
to play the part of an undisciplined revolutionary, taking on
himself alone the responsibility of his adventures."
The policies of the Grand Master Cavour and the Grand
Master Mazzini, each representing two different Masonic
currents emanating from different sources, met on the issue
of the destruction of the Papacy which it was hoped to
submerge through the unification of Italy.
Cavour aimed at unity in the form of a constitutional
monarchy under the house of Savoy and Mazzini,

274

OCCULT THEOCRASY

aiming at a republic, found himself forced into a compromise
which obliged him to accept, temporarily at least,
a
Piedmontese monarchy for United Italy.
The captain of Freemasonry was Garibaldi, the tool of
Palmerston, Cavour and Mazzini.
While working thus together and helping one another,
Mazzini and Cavour each followed an occult personal and
distinct line of action, the secrets of which they did not share.
Each in his mysterious work had his chief agent, the man he
trusted. The chief agents of Cavour were his Jewish secretary
Isaac Artom and Carletti and the chief agents of Mazzini
were his Jewish secretaries, Wolf, Lemmi and L'Olper.
After the flight of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Lemmi
went to Florence where, to better mask his play, he became a
banker. His patrons Mazzini and Kossuth were never in want
of money furnished either by England or Masonry. He made
money, practising usury as a good Jew, charging it is said up
to 200 and 300 per cent, but, in politics, he continued as a
valuable auxiliary to Mazzini.
Garibaldi and Mazzini wished to push on to Rome but
Victor Emmanuel thought it more prudent to leave well
enough alone for the time being, and the Piedmontese
government finally overruled the revolutionaries. Mazzini
and Crispi were even asked to leave Naples by the authorities
though Lemmi was not molested.
Cavour knew him to be the secret agent of Mazzini and had
him watched and his record investigated but, though he did
not trouble himself much about him, he wanted to insure
himself against all anti-monarchist action on his part.
During this inquiry, he came across the records of Lemmi's
youthful exploits at Marseilles in 1844, so

ADRIANO LEMMI

275

he asked the government of Napoleon III for an official copy
of this document which lay in the archives of the Ministry of
the Interior of the Italian government for 31 years and proved
a powerful weapon in the hands of Victor Emmanuel, and
Humbert I. Chafing under the menace of the existence of this
document however, Lemmi induced Crispi in 1893 to arrange
for its disappearance, but this move was forestalled by an
implacable enemy of Lemmi who succeeded in getting possession of the famous paper. 8
In 1867, Lemmi entered into negotiations with the
Freemason Graf von Bismarck and the first projects of
alliance between Prussia and Italy date thenceforth. Lemmi
hated France as much as did Mazzini, so it is not surprising to
find them both intriguing with Bismarck to bring about a
Franco-Italian estrangement.
Napoleon III, by the convention of Sept. 15, 1864, had
established Rome and its surrounding territory as distinct
from the Kingdom of Italy, so that till 1870, the church still
retained this last fragment of its temporal possessions but,
towards 1865, Mazzini organized an association for Italian
Unity, the object of which was the Union of these States with
the rest of Italy, with Rome for the capital, according to
Garibaldi's programme. Mazzini however was afraid to go to
Rome without the consent of France, thinking that the
destruction of the temporal power of the Pope, in the face of
French opposition, could only be obtained by means of a
revolution.
No one is ignorant of the negotiations between France,
Austria and Italy in 1867, fruitless, because of Napoleon's
refusal to accede to the proposal of the

Austrian minister de Beust to allow " United " Italy freedom
to march on Rome. France, subsequently abandoned by Italy,
met her fate at Sedan in 1870 and Bismarck used Mazzini and
Italian Freemasonry to break the Franco-Italian alliance and
to force Victor Emmanuel to take Rome in spite of the wishes
of the French people.
When the Franco-Prussian war broke out in 1870, the time
for revolution was ripe. In July, shortly after the declaration of
hostilities, the Italian revolutionaries held a mass meeting in
the theatre at Milan, organized by the most notorious and
dreaded agitators in Italy. After this public meeting, there was
a secret political one attended by 15 high masons. Those
present, according to Oreste Cucchi, who was told of it by
Fabrizi himself, were : Doctor Timoteo Riboli, Francesco
Crispi, Colonel Cucchi, Asproni, Bertani, Fabrizi, Fra-polli,
Cairoli, Rattazzi, Seismit Doda, Morelli, Sineo, Cosentini,
Mancini and General Raffaelo Cadorna. The object of this
conference was to determine the line of conduct to be adopted
in the event of the defeat of Napoleon's army, and it was
decided to send Cucchi to Bismarck to obtain from the
Prussian government the necessary arms to go to Rome
should Victor Emmanuel persist in his attitude of vacillation.
Cucchi accomplished his mysterious mission, and Bismarck
concluded a deal whereby Prussia was to furnish guns and
money to the Italian revolutionaries, in return for which they
were to keep up agitation to prevent an Italian alliance with
the French nation.
Everything was ready. Still, Victor Emmanuel hesitated.
Public opinion was rapidly being manufactured with the
assistance of Bismarck's money, so the deputies of the Left
who signed a petition for the occupation of

ADRIANO LEMMI

277

Rome, on being asked what they would do if the ministry
refused their demand answered " We will make barricades
and with the people we will go to Rome without you ! "
The government then decided to act, and General Cadorna,
who had already been selected by Freemasonry to lead a
popular army should the government not wish to send him
there in an official capacity, marched on Rome.
The operations of war began on September 15, 1870, and
on September 20, at five o'clock in the morning, the cannon
of Cadorna settled the Roman question. The Porta Pia was
forced. The sacrifice was accomplished. Freemasonry had
triumphed.
But Freemasonry had won again when, according to Mr.
George d'Heylli, writing in February 1871,9 " Mr. Gambetta,
who was the arbitrary master of that country's (France)
destiny during the three months that his dictatorship lasted,
was able, without anyone daring to oppose his conduct, to
misuse his power in order to unsettle the country and satisfy
his own ambitions. He trampled the country's laws under foot,
by slighting the most elementary rules of civilised society, by
hunting from their benches magistrates immovibles, and from
the council chambers those who had been elected by suffrage,
by taking the war into his own hands, by promoting and
depriving officers of their rank, by suddenly changing ,
according to his own whims and fancies or those of his
advisers, his opinions, schemes and plans. "
Such indeed is the example given by all the demagogues
who act in the name of " The People " !

ters of the Commune, Gambetta made one of his most
eloquent speeches, the result of which was that a vote of
amnesty was passed in their favour.
In 1871, he further consolidated his power by issuing a
decree declaring that the former servitors of the Empire
would be ineligible to membership in the National Assembly
which was convened to ratify the treaty with Prussia.
By this time, Adriano Lemmi had attained prosperity and
become the owner of vast estates near Florence.
Mazzini died on March 11, 1872, and, at his request,
Lemmi was appointed by Albert Pike to succeed him as chief
of the Sovereign Executive Directory.
In 1870, the Marquis of Ripon, who had succeeded the Earl
of Zetland as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England,
resigned his office and became a Roman Catholic. He was
succeeded by the Prince of Wales, later to be Edward VII,
King of England, received Knight Kadosch in 1882 on Jan. 28,
and Affilie Supe-rieur, Grand Orient, in 1883. 10
Adriano Lemmi, a Palladist, though not yet a member of
the Supreme Council of Rome, soon concluded that the secret
superior authority conferred on him could best be enhanced in
Italy by smashing the various Supreme Councils for the
benefit of one. Unity of Italian Masonry was then his aim.
Success in this project depended on slow, deliberate
manoeuvring, secrecy concerning his palladist affiliation,
temporary restriction of the number of triangles in the
peninsula and, above all, forbearance in dealing with the rival
powers established in the ordinary rites.
In 1875, the scene of Masonic intrigue had shifted to
England. The Khedive of Egypt, being at the time

financially embarrassed offered his shares in the Suez Canal
Co. for sale.
" The Due Decazes, French Minister of Foreign Affairs,
failed to inform the French authorities of the Khedive's
predicament, while the Rothschilds ", (on the information of
their Egyptian agent, Ambroise Cinadino) " secretly
advanced to Disraeli, then Prime Minister of England, the
necessary funds to deliver the controlling interest of the canal
to Britain, thus striking an International Coup d'etat, the
significance of which was only dimly appreciated when, in
the following year, Disraeli had Queen Victoria proclaimed
Empress of India. " n
Thus the controlling interest of the great waterway to the
East was vested in England to have and to hold, till the British
Empire, about to be created, should cease to serve the
purpose of its makers.
In June 1877, Adriano Lemmi12 became an ordinary
member of the Grand Orient of Italy at Rome, of which
Giuseppe Mazzoni was Grand Master, keeping this affiliation
secret till 1883, when he let it be known that he was joint
Grand Master with Giuseppe Petroni.
" At this date, the rivalry for supremacy in Scottish Rites
had become acute, for the Roman Grand Orient wished to
dominate over the Supreme Council of Italy at Turin, of
which Timoteo Riboli was Grand Master. The Grand
Commander of the Roman Supreme Council was Senator
Colonel George Tamajo, though its real chief was Luigi
Castellazzo. With the secret aid of the latter and the further
assistance of Count Piancini, Tamajo was induced to abdicate
his rights for 50,000 francs, and on January 21, 1885, the

of Rome was absorbed by the Grand Orient of Italy.
All Lemmi now required to complete his victory was to
absorb the Supreme Council of Turin, but Riboli, the only
real and legitimate representative of Italian Freemasonry,
recognized by the Convention of Universal Scottish Rites at
Lausanne, in 1875, and by all the Masonic powers of the
world, had no wish to part with a source of revenue or to
defer to the little Jew at Rome who was invested with no
recognized superior authority.
Lemmi, who well knew that his secret title of Palla-dist
chief assured him eventual supremacy, addressed himself to
the Sovereign Pontiff at Charleston, Albert Pike, to whom he
explained the danger to Italian Masonry of such intense
dissensions and the necessity for fusion in the great struggle
against the Vatican, stating further that the authority of Rome,
the capital of Italy since 1870, must be recognized by the
foreign Masonic powers.
His reasons appealed to the Sovereign Pontiff of Universal
Freemasonry who, in November 1886, entirely disarmed
Riboli by promising him an indemnity of 30,000 francs.
Riboli acquiesced and the money was handed out from the
central fund of the order.
In the Supreme Administrative Directory of Berlin, the
payment of this sum is recorded in the balance sheet of 1887
under the heading of exceptional expenses in the following
terms : 13
"Suppression of the Supr.\ Cons.', of Italy sitting at Turin.

Before pocketing his 30,000 francs, Riboli raised a
13. Margiotta, op. cit, pp. 105 et seq.

ADRIANO LEMMI

281

great row, abusing Lemmi and objecting to the fusion of the
Supreme Council of Turin with that of Rome. Ignoring the
fact that in 1885 Tamajo had received 50 000 francs for the
same reason, he sent protests broadcast in the shape of
balustres demonstrating the legality of the supreme Council
of Turin and the illegality of that of the Roman Centre.
Many Freemasons rallied to his assistance. A great
movement was started to do away with the despotism of
Lemmi, and numerous Lodges were founded under the "
obedience of Turin. "
Lemmi however, being Chief of Political Action in high
masonry, had a great advantage over his opponents, but he
could not make good his title before the lodges, nine-tenths of
whose members ignored the very existence of Universal
Central Masonry, the secret of which was to be kept under
penalty of death. On the other hand, this was solely a matter
concerning Scottish Rites for the protection of which the
Supreme Council of Switzerland existed as the Executive
power of the Scottish Confederation. This council is
distinctly separate from the secret executive of Central high
masonry whose one concern is international politics, so no
confusion was possible.
During a nine months' campaign, Lemmi's opponents
gained many adherents for Riboli, who, suddenly reversing
his position, capitulated on the intervention of Albert Pike.
Thirty thousand francs had done the trick.
For the benefit of his dupes, Pike had deceitfully declared
in the fundamental constitution of high masonry that the
Constitution, Statutes and Regulations of each rite would
always be respected by Charleston. In order to propitiate
Lemmi, he tore up that rite of which Riboli believed him to be
the Patriarch and President !

282

OCCULT

The Supreme Council of Lausanne was much embarrassed
inasmuch as, where Scottish Rites was concerned, it was
obliged to admit that Lemmi's opponents were in the right,
and that as a Scottish Rites Mason he, as Petroni's successor,
the Chief of Political Action of secret high masonry, was a
rebel.
In an effort to beat the devil around the bush, Riboli and
Tamajo, pretending to take Lemmi as their temporary
delegate, accepted for themselves the empty honorary title of
Sovereign Grand Commander ad vitam, while Lemmi became
Sovereign Grand Commander delegate invested with the real
power.
Italian Freemasonry was united. A meeting was convened
at Florence in January 1887, by Tamajo and Riboli at which
seven brothers from Rome and seven from Turin, under
orders from Charleston, ratified this agreement.
Lemmi misappropriated masonic funds and profited by his
position to exploit everyone, during which period of frenzied
finance, he pocketed over four hundred thousand francs.
Many complaints of his conduct were sent to the Supreme
Directory at Charleston but while passing through the hands
of Phileas Walder who shared in the loot, anything to
Lemmi's discredit was suppressed, never reaching Pike who
trusted him till the end.
It was in 1881 that Lemmi had embarked on his campaign
for the dechristianization of Italy, giving, under his invisible
direction, an organization to the scattered forces of
anticlericalism. Mazzini had made no mistake for Lemmi
persecuted the church with a savage hatred.
During a Masonic congress held at Milan in 1881, the
following resolutions were adopted : —

Women are henceforth to be eligible for Freemasonry and
feminine lodges are to be founded as soon as possible.
3
It is deemed necessary by the congress to establish workmen's
lodges in the city as well as in the country. These lodges to be free,
except for a nominal fee to cover unavoidable expenses.
4
It is decided to institute a corps of secret masonic messengers
whose mission is to transmit to all lodges the orders and
instructions of the chief. These messengers are to be chosen from
among Masons having no personal encumbrances and whose
devotion to the order has been of long standing. They are to be
registered at no particular lodge deriving their powers directly from
the central authority of Italian masonry.
5

A corps of brother propagandists, themselves unknown as Masons,
is to be created. They are to travel from town to town as peddlers
and merchants of all kinds, spreading everywhere, notably among
the rural populations, opinions favourable to masonry. In the course
of their peregrinations hey are to abstain from visiting local
masonic lodgss and are to be known as " Travelling Brothers. "

Should the order wish to initiate a personage of very high social
rank or one who, in the opinion of the Grand Master should happen
to be in a position demanding the strictest secrecy, his initiation
need be known only to the Assistant Grand Master or the Grand
Secretary and the Grand Treasurer.
7
The congress declares the solution of the social questions and the
winning for the legitimate workers of their rights to be its chief
concern. The Lodges are authorized to hold debates on the most
practical means of obtaining governmental support for all measures
tending to abolish pauperism and the improvement of the lot of the
working classes.
This, the seventh resolution of the Congress, to be made public.
8
The liberal forces of Italy are to be secretly organized and the
lodges are to act in such a way as to gain for Freemasonry a
majority of the national representation in Parliament.
The Congress adopts for Italy the rule passed by the Grand Orient
of France in 1848, under the title "Masonic rules to be followed
with regard to elections. "
9
The Congress declares the chief object of the efforts of Italian
Freemasonry to be, for the present, to obtain from the government :
—
a — The regulation of the ecclesiastical patrimony, the property
of which belongs to the state and the administration of which
belongs to the civil powers :
b — The strenuous application of all existing laws guaranteeing
to the civil society its independence with regard to clerical
influence :

ADRIANO LEMMI

285

c — The enforcement of existing laws by virtue of which
religious congregations are to be suppressed, and the suggestion of
measures calculated to prevent these laws from being evaded :
d — The promulgation of the law relating to the property of
religious bodies (confiscation) :
e — The suppression of all religious instruction in the schools :
j —. The creation of schools for young girls where the pupils can
be protected from any kind of clerical influence.
10
Finally the Congress decided to create by masonic initiative one
great, politically non-partisan, anti-clerical party whose object
would be to fight and destroy clericalism by any and all means.
Adriano Lemmi promptly obeyed Pike's orders and the
resolutions of the Congress which he himself had dictated, by
establishing in Rome on July 13, 1881, ten anticlerical auxiliary
lodges, the foundation expenses of which were paid by the
Supreme Directory of Rome. By his order, similar lodges were
founded in almost every important town of the peninsula.
Lemmi is a Satanist and he organized the anticlerical movement
as a Satanist. 14 Besides his effort to destroy the church, he led a
movement to spread " The Nature Cult " well knowing that the
secret protection of this sect would always be afforded him in the
event of that of the anti-catholic government of Italy being
withdrawn. This sect does not as yet dare to reveal its supreme aim
as, say the chiefs, " the world is not yet ready to receive
enlightenment by the true light. "
• The reader must remember that at the date when the above
was written by Margiotta, Lemmi was still alive.

286

OCCULT THEOCRASY

So Lemmi first preached Lucifer and then fought
Christianity by combating the idea of the supernatural!
All his discourses and manifests were composed either by
Ulisse Bacci, an atheist, or Umberto dal Medico, a
Luciferian.
His instructions to the Italian anticlericals were also put
into operation by the Freemasons of other countries, for the
supreme object of the sect is the suppression, by a terrible
social upheaval, of the religion of God, and its substitution by
that of Satan, known to the dupes of Masonry as " The Great
Architect of the Universe. "
On November 21, 1888, Lemmi wrote Pike a letter
appealing for help in his fight against the Vatican. The letter
closed with the following paragraph : —
" Help us in our struggle against the Vatican, thou whose
authority is supreme, and under thy impulse all the lodges of
Europe and America will rally to our cause. "
Pike needed little urging and immediately fell in with
Lemmi's plans.
On March 30th, 1889, the Mother Lodge Archimede took
the initiative in an effort to shake oif Lemmi's tyrannical yoke
by announcing the formation of " The Masonic Federation of
the Independent Lodges of Italy. " Lemmi was much
perturbed by this effort at secession which he finally
succeeded in crushing by the use of the power of gold. After
the Federation had called a second congress, he sent one of
his secret agents to Palermo with ten thousand francs to buy
oif the Scelsi brothers. Discord was thus sown in the ranks of
the Federation. Soon, the disintegration was complete, the
centre of Palermo vanished and opposition was crushed.
Towards this period, Lemmi got control of the

ADRIANO LEMMI

287

Italian tobacco monopoly through which he succeeded, by
swindling methods, in acquiring several millions. The whole
affair was aired in Parliament but the intimidated deputies
voted to save the reputation of the sect and in order to
suppress the scandal, although Colonel Achille Bizzoni,
Depute Matteo Renato, Impriani Poerio and several
newspapers took up the matter and made a great row which
ended in the usual way when the public gets tired of a subject.
As a result of Lemmi's politics in the elections of 1890, no
decent honest and independent candidate for political
position had a chance of being elected against one of his
hand-picked nominees. Italian politics became a Freemasonic
monopoly and the people were mercilessly exploited by the
dregs of society backed by Lemmi and his money, much of
which was extorted from the Banca Romana.
On April 2, 1891, Albert Pike died and was succeeded in
the supreme Grand College of Masons by Albert George
Mackey, who held the post for two years and five months.
There were great rivalries between the members of Pike's
staff, and Albert George Mackey was chosen as a
compromise candidate who was unlikely to interfere
seriously with any of the others.
With neither strength of character, energy nor activity, he
was no match for Lemmi who aspired to the supreme
Masonic power as well as to the handling of the Masonic
central funds for the expenditure of a large part of which no
account was required by the Supreme Directory at Berlin.
The International organization was now a formidable
machine composed of 77 triangular provinces, the
archdiocese of high masonry and 33 Lotus Mother Lodges,
the founder lodges and generators of Palladism.
With Phileas Walder as accomplice, Lemmi lost

288

OCCULT THEOCRASY

no time in starting to undermine the power of Charleston, but
to realize this project it was first necessary to create a
movement in the triangular provinces. To this end, he
employed his secret political agents of the Executive
Directory of Rome, practically all of whom were Jews. These
agents were registered in the central directory only by a
number and a special Masonic name and were unknown even
to the Grand Masters of the provincial lodges as well as to the
brothers and sisters at the head of a Lotus Mother Lodge.
His particular agent in London in 1893 was supposed to be
an old Piccadilly Jew called Daniel Mold. The came under
which he was registered for this Triangular province, in the
Grand Central Directory at Naples, was Adam-Kadzmoun,
the magical value of the letters of which, when added, give
the total of 244 exactly as do the letters of his real name.
Lemmi was not forced to rely solely upon his special
agents, for he also had the unanimous support of the powerful
secret Jewish lodges.
By the decree of Sept. 12, 1874, which confirmed a treaty
signed by Armand Levi for the Jewish B'nai B'rith (brothers
of the Alliance) of America, Germany and England and the
supreme authority of Charleston, Albert Pike authorized the
Jewish Freemasons to form a secret federation functioning
side by side with the ordinary lodges. This secret society was
to bear the title of Sovereign Patriarchal Council and its
Universal centre was to be at Hamburg, Valentinskamp
Strasse. In subscriptions alone, it collected one million four
hundred thousand francs a year which were used for general
Jewish propaganda. 15
15. At that date the franc was at 5 to the dollar.

ADRIANO LEMMI

Under the terms of this document (given in full on p. 225 of
Adriano Lemmi by D. Margiotta), Jewish Masonry, unlike
Gentile Masonry, was not to be graded, its members were
exempt from belonging to any other official rite and " the
secret of its existence " was to be most strictly kept by those
members of High Masonry who had been informed by the
Supreme Dogmatic Directory of its existence. 16
The latter clause in the agreement is. undoubtedly
responsible for the equivocal attitude of all High Masons with
regard to the past and present, national and international,
secret political activities of the B'nai B'rith. In the interests of
humanity, the conspiracy of secrecy should be revealed, for
the control of the international balance of power and the
possibilities of the international spy system thus established,
are a menace to the welfare and peace of the peoples of the
world.
" A Jew of French descent, this Armand Levi, above
referred to, had attached himself to the Napoleons at an early
time and was employed by them in various ways... As a
member of the " International " he represented the
possibilities of an Imperial Socialism... and when the
barricades were built, his name was in the Commune and his
voice was raised for the

Consistory as well as those of America and England, the

extremist counsels. He it was who rose in the Hotel de Ville,
to ask that all the deputies of Paris should be summoned from
Versailles, and if they would not come should be deposed,
convicted, and condemned to death. " 17
It was indeed in the heart of the Jewish lodges that the
plans to manufacture the public opinion necessary to the
success of Lemmi's ambitious project were made, and what
actually happened was the result of a plot of the Sovereign
Patriarchal Council of Hamburg against the Supreme
Dogmatic Directory of Charleston.
Hamburg won in the end and the secret Jewish control of
the powerful machine of International Masonry was assured.
The Jewish Lodges were Lemmi's willing tools, and fifty
thousand Masons, simultaneously Palladists and members of
the Hamburg federation, under orders given by the Jewish
agents in the pay of the Chief of Political action, made over a
period of three months, in the triangles and secret Jewish
lodges, a splendid propaganda calculated to induce discussion
and approval of the transfer of the Supreme Dogmatic
Directory of Charleston to Rome. Everywhere, by every
means, the agents of Lemmi worked indefatigably to create a
demand for the removal of the headquarters of the order from
Charleston to Rome, on the pretext that the power of the
Vatican could be better fought at close quarters. These
reclamations of a noisy minority were then magnified for the
benefit of the Grand Council of Masons at Charleston into a
threat of imminent secession and, after much manoeuvring,
Phileas Walder succeeded in inducing George Mackey and
the American
17. Onslow Yorke, Secret History of The International, pp. 52
and 55-56.

ADRIANO LEMMI

291

Masons to sign the decree convening the Sovereign
Convention. Walder, having remarked that Lemmi was not to
be a candidate for the Supreme Grand Mastership in case of
the passage of a vote of transfer of which he maintained there
was no danger, seeing that the majority of the triangles
favoured Charleston as the seat of High Masonry, the
American Masons, over confident of the outcome of the
convention, overlooked the importance of the choice of the
town in which it was to meet.
On May 20, 1893, after all the delegates had been elected,
Lemmi suddenly launched his decree of chief organizer
appointing Rome as the convention city.
Had everything been straight, Charleston would have
come out of the trial of the secret Convention with a majority
of 52 votes, for only 25 provinces favoured the move to
Rome, but to Lemmi, all ways, including bribery and crime,
were good.
On the eve of the opening of the Convention, fourteen of
the delegates favouring Charleston were suddenly taken ill,
and elections for substitute delegates were held in five of the
Grand Triangles but in the remaining nine, the provincial
Grand Masters, owing to lack of time or some other reason,
referred the matter by telegram to Charleston. George
Mackey answered " Send Bovio proxy to provide a European
substitute. "
It was suicide. Bovio, Grand Master General of the Grand
Central Directory of Naples, and his lieutenants were entirely
devoted to Lemmi in whom George Mackey continued
blindly to confide. The nine sudden illnesses of the American
delegates (the only ones he knew of) had failed to open his
eyes and he continued counting 52 votes against the transfer !

292

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Apart from two or three American delegates, all those who
landed in England in August and were entertained by the
Mother Lodge of the Lotus of England in the secret temple at
32, Oxford Street (Frascati's) were oblivious of the imminent
crisis.
When the Grand Central Directory of Naples received
these proxies, nine Italian delegates were named to represent
Cleveland, Memphis, Guatemala, Havana, Caracas, Lima, La
Paz, Treinta-y-Tres and Port Louis, one of whom abstained
from voting while the rest cynically voted against the wishes
of the province they represented.
The count of the ballots gave the following result out of 77
delegates :
48 delegates for the transfer to Rome,
25 delegates against the transfer to Rome, 4 delegates not
voting the transfer to Rome.
After this essentially fraudulent transfer of the real
masonic power from Charleston to Rome, the rest was easy.
The ten Masons of Charleston retained their empty titles in
an honorary capacity while Lemmi, now self-styled
Sovereign Pontiff, named ten other active Masons, but owing
to the difficulties attendant on the meetings of these widely
dispersed magnates, he created a Supreme Triangle, with two
assistants Carducci and Ferrari, the members of which were :
—
Patriarch Emeritus Mason, Germany, Findel (Kether-368)
at Leipzig.
Patriarch Emeritus Mason, of India, Hobbs (Khokhma-926)
at Calcutta.

Jewish,
International Jewry has much to explain !
Lemmi died in 1896 and was succeeded by Ernesto Nathan, an
English Jew, who, in view of the intimacy which had existed
between his mother, Sarah Nathan and Mazzini, was said to have
been the l a t te r ' s natural son.
Lemmi left a son called Silvano Lemmi.
In 1895, a schismatic masonic group calling itself the Grand
Orient of Italy was founded. On March 5, 1899, it held a meeting at
which it adopted a constitution of its own after which Lemmi's
Grand Orient and the new one settled down to a state of secret civil

successful. On the 19th of April, 1897, the author, writing under the

" It then proceeds to devote five columns out of the six and a half
which compose the article to describing the works of two notorious
romancers, Leo Taxil and Bataille. There is not a word of real

Indeed we owe Mrs. Webster a debt of gratitude for thus drawing

reliable work, to eliminate certain phases of religious history. Those
phases are the personal histories of Albert Pike, the Great Freemason and Giuseppe Mazzini, the Great Revolutionist.

being allowed entrance to that room and threatened finally to have
the door forced.
" In the face of such a threat, the guards of Lemmi were
compelled to give in and the representatives of the lessor entered the
palladian temple.
" Its lateral walls were hung with magnificent red and black
damask draperies. At the further end was a great piece of tapestry
upon which was the figure of Satan at whose feet "was an altar. Here
and there were arranged triangles, squares and other symbolic signs
of the sect as well as books and masonic rituals. All around stood
gilt chairs. Each of these, in the moulding which capped its back,
had a glass eye, the interior of which was lighted by electricity,
while in the middle of the temple stood a curious throne, that of the
Great Satanic Pontiff.
Owing to the state of terror into which this unexpected sight
plunged them, the visitors beat a hasty retreat without further

Freemasonry, as the average mason sees it, teaches
brotherhood and many worthy and exalted principles. It is
primarily a charity organization and only good men are
eligible to its ranks. To them the G in the Pentagon means
God, but needless to say, if its teaching were not of a noble
idealistic character it would make few proselytes.
Within the lodges, and among the members thereof, are
members of other rites which the British Mason is
deliberately taught contemptuously to refuse to acknowledge
as Masonic. Many of these are the recruiting sergeants for the
secret societies who make their selection at leisure, choosing
only such initiates as seem to them likely to serve their ends.
Once in the higher grades, a man who has, too late, been
found to be intractable, can continue to the highest visible
point of initiation along the track prepared by those who mean
him to know nothing. All is beautiful, all is noble, he sees
only the best, and for ever advertises the goodness of
Freemasonry.
Though in this capacity he may do nothing else, he
becomes an important factor in recruiting.
It is frequently alleged that no English Mason is

We give the following quotations from the Encyclopaedia

register certain historical facts, leaving their interpretation to
the personal judgment of the reader. l
" The Company of the Jesuits was founded by Don Inigo
de Loyola (Ignatius Loyola), a Spanish nobleman and soldier,
on April 5, 1541, at the church of Saint Paul without the
Walls, near Rome, under the sanction of the Pope, Paul III.
" It has six grades. These are novices, scholastics, temporal,
coadjutors, professed of the three vows, and professed of the
four vows, the latter two grades being the only ones which
confer a share in the government and eligibility for the offices
of the society. Its head, virtually a commander-in-chief, is
known as The General. He wields absolute power over the
members who are pledged to blind obedience. The General
claims his authority from The Pope.

The " fourth vow " is one of special allegiance to the Pope
promising to go in obedience to him for missionary purposes
whensoever and whithersoever he may order, — a pledge
seriously qualified in practice, however, by the power given
to the general of alone sending out or recalling any
missionary.
" The question has long been hotly debated whether, in
addition to these six avowed grades, there be not a seventh,
answering in some degree to the Tertiaries of the Franciscan
and Dominican orders, secretly affiliated to the society, and
acting as its unsuspected emissaries in various lay positions.
This class is styled in France ' Jesuits of the short robe ', and
some evidence in support of its actual existence was alleged
during the lawsuits against the company under Louis XV.
The Jesuits themselves deny the existence of any such body,
and are able to adduce the negative disproof that no provision
for it is to be found in their constitutions. On the other hand,
there are clauses therein which make the creation of such a
class perfectly feasible if thought expedient. One is the power
given to the general to receive candidates secretly, and to
conceal their admission, for which there is a remarkable
precedent in the case of Francis Borgia, duke of Gandia,
afterwards himself general of the society; the other is an even
more singular clause, providing for the admission of
candidates to the company by persons who are not themselves
members of it. ... The general, who should by the statutes of
the society reside permanently at Rome, holds in his hands
the right of appointment, not only to the office of provincial
over each of the great districts into which the houses are
mapped, but to the offices of each house in particular, no
shadow of electoral right or even suggestion being
recognized.
" The superiors and rectors of all houses and Colleges

in Europe must report weekly to their provincial on all
matters concerning the members of the society and all
outsiders with whom they may have had dealings of any sort.
The provincial, for his part, must report monthly to the
general, giving him a summary of all details which have
reached himself. But, as a check on him, all superiors of
houses in his province are to make separate reports directly to
the general once in three months, and further to communicate
with him, without delay, every time any matter of importance
occurs, irrespective of any information which the provincial
may have forwarded. Nor is this all; an elaborate system of
espionage and delation forms part of the recognized order of
every house, and, in direct contrast to the ancient indictment
and confession of faults in open conventual chapter, every
inmate of a house is liable to secret accusation to its superior,
while the superior himself may be similarly delated to the
provincial or the general.
" Nor is the general himself exempt from control on the
part of the society, lest by any possible error he be unfaithful
to its interests. A consultative council is imposed on him by
the general congregation, consisting of six persons, whom he
may neither select nor remove, — namely, four assistants,
each representing a nation, an admonisher or adviser
(resembling the adla-tus of a military commander) to warn
him of any faults or mistakes, and his confessor. One of these
must be in constant attendance on him; and, while he is not at
liberty to abdicate his office, nor to accept any dignity or
office outside it without the assent of the society, he may yet
be suspended or deposed by its authority.
" There would seem at first to be an effectual external
check provided, however, in the fact that, while all the

THE

ORDER OF THE JESUITS

311

officers of the society, except the council aforesaid, hold of
the general, he in turn holds of the Pope, and is his liegeman
directly, as well as in virtue of the fourth vow, which he has
taken in common with the other professed. But such is the
extraordinary skill with which the relations of the society to
the papacy were originally drafted by Loyola, and
subsequently worked by his successors, that it has always
remained organically independent, and might very
conceivably break with Rome without imperilling its own
existence. The general has usually stood towards the Pope
much as a powerful grand feudatory of the Middle Ages did
towards a weak titular lord paramount, or perhaps as the
captain of a splendid host of ' Free Companions ' did towards
a potentate with whom he chose to take temporary and
precarious service; and the shrewd Roman populace have
long shown their recognition of this fact [by styling these two
great personages severally the ' White Pope ' and the ' Black
Pope '. In truth the society has never, from the very first,
obeyed the Pope, whenever its will and his happened to run
counter to each other.
" The merited odium which has overtaken the Inquisition,
usually officered by Dominicans, has induced the Jesuits,
whose own controversial methods had been different, to
disclaim all connexion with that tribunal, and to represent
their society as free from complicity in its acts. But, in truth, it
was Ignatius Loyola himself who procured its erection in
Portugal in 1545-6, and F. Nithard, one of the very few
cardinals of the society, was inquisitor-general of that
kingdom in 1655.

and mode of life in 1605, a step sanctioned by Gregory XV, in
1623, the fathers who followed his example pushed the new
caste-feeling so far as absolutely to refuse the ministrations
and sacraments of religion to the pariahs, lest the Brahmin
converts should take offence, •— an attempt which was
reported to Rome by Norbert, a Capuchin, and by the bishop
of Rosalia and was vainly censured in the pontifical briefs of
Innocent X in 1645, Clement IX in 1669,Clement XII in 1734
and 1739, and Benedict XIV, in 1745. The ' Chinese rites ',
assailed with equal unsuccess by 9 popes, were not finally put
down until 1744, by a bull of Benedict XIV... By these rites
the Jesuit missionaries had virtually assimilated Christianity
to heathenism> and their practical reply in opposition to a
papal decree in 1700 was to obtain an edict from the emperor
of China declaring that there was nothing idolatrous or
superstitious in the inculpated usages, while in 1710 they
flung Cardinal Tournon, legate of Clement XI, into the prison
of the Inquisition at Macao, where he perished. Finally, they
disobeyed the brief of suppression issued by Clement XIV in
1773, which enjoined them to disperse at once, to send back
all novices to their houses, and to receive no more members.
It is thus clear that the society has always regarded itself as an
independent power, ready indeed to co-operate with the
papacy so long as their roads and interests are the same, and to
avail itself to the uttermost of the many pontifical decrees in
its own favour, but drawing the line far short of practical
submission when their interests diverge. ' The Jesuit power,
much weakened in England by the rise of the Jewish Power
with the advent of Cromwell, persisted nevertheless in its
efforts to recapture its former status in that land. During the
reign of James II, it schemed and intrigued incessantly

sentatives Father St. Germain2 and his successor Father
Columbiere. 3 After the enactment of the limitation of the
English throne to Protestant succession the Jesuit
diplomatists were hard put.
To quote the Encyclopedia further :
" After many difficulties they had succeeded in getting a
footing in France, through the help of Duprat, bishop of
Clermont, who founded a college for them in 1545 in the
town of Billom, besides making over to them his house at
Paris, the Hotel de Clermont, which became the nucleus of
the afterwards famous college of Louis-le-Grand, while a
formal legalization was granted to them by the states-general
at Poissy in 1561. "
From the Jesuit College at Ingolstadt is said to have issued
the sect known as " The Illuminati of Bavaria " founded by
Adam Weishaupt under the guidance of Nicolai, in 1776.
Weishaupt, its nominal founder, however, seems to have
played a subordinate though conspicuous role in the
organization of this sect. (See page 370).
On July 21, 1773, the Pope had abolished the order of
Jesuits but Frederic II of Prussia encouraged and protected
them with a view no doubt of using their political knowledge
and skill against the Bourbons, the Hapsburgs and the Pope.
The well-known authority on theocratic organizations,
Heckethorn, writes the following concerning the Jesuits : '
There is considerable analogy between Masonic and Jesuitic
degrees ; and the Jesuits also tread down the shoe and bare the
knee, because Ignatius Loyola thus presented himself at
Rome and asked for the confirmation of the order.

" Not satisfied with confession, preaching, and instruction,
whereby they had acquired unexampled influence, they
formed in Italy and France, in 1563 several ' Congregations ',
i. e. clandestine meetings held in subterranean chapels and
other secret places. The congregationists had a sectarian
organization, with appropriate catechisms and manuals,
which had to be given up before death, wherefore very

To show the further similarity of the Jesuit-JudaicMasonic-Gnostic-Brahmin-Illuminati theology we now

" Initiation. — From this, as well as other works, we gather
some of the ceremonies with which aspirants were initiated
into the Order. Having in nearly all Roman Catholic countries
succeeded in becoming the educators of the young, they were
able to mould the youthful mind according to their secret aims.
If then, after a number of years, they detected in the pupil a
blind and fanatic faith, conjoined with exalted pietism and
indomitable courage, they proceeded to initiate him; in the
opposite case, they excluded him. The proofs lasted
twenty-four hours, for which the candidate was prepared by
long and severe fasting, which, by prostrating his bodily
strength, inflamed his fancy, and, just before the trial, a
powerful drink was administered to him. Then the mystic
scene began — diabolical apparitions, evocation of the dead,
representations of the flames of hell, skeletons, moving skulls,

thunder and lightning, in fact, the whole paraphernalia and
apparatus of the ancient mysteries. If the neophyte, who was
closely watched, showed fear or terror, he remained for ever
in the inferior degree ; but if he bore the proof well, he was
advanced to a higher grade.
" At the initiation into the second degree (Scholas-tici) the
same proofs, but on a grander scale, had to be undergone. The
candidate, again prepared for them by long fastings, was led
with his eyes bandaged into a large cavern, resounding with
wild howlings and roarings, which he had to traverse, reciting
at the same time prayers specially appointed for that occasion.
At the end of the cave he had to crawl through a narrow
opening, and while doing this, the bandage was taken from his
eyes by an unseen hand, and he found himself in & square
dungeon, whose floor was covered with a mortuary cloth, on
which stood three lamps, shedding a feeble light on the skulls
and skeletons ranged around. This was the Cave of Evocation,
the Black Chamber, so famous in the annals of the Fathers.
Here, giving himself up to prayer, the neophyte passed some
time, during which the priests could, without his being aware
of it, watch his every movement and gesture. If his behaviour
was satisfactory, all at once two brethren, representing
archangels, presented themselves before him, without his
being able to tell whence they had so suddenly started up, — a
good deal can be done with properly fitted and oiled
trap-doors, — and, observing perfect silence, bound his
forehead with a white band soaked with blood, and covered
with hieroglyphics; they then hung a small crucifix round his
neck, and a small satchel containing relics, or what did duty
for them. Finally, they took off all his clothing, which they
cast on a pyre in one corner of the cave, and marked

316

OCCULT THEOCRASY

his body with numerous crosses, drawn with blood. At this
point, the hierophant with his assistants entered and, having
bound a red cloth round the middle of the candidate's body,
the brethren, clothed in bloodstained garments, placed
themselves beside him, and drawing their daggers, formed the
steel arch over his head. A carpet being then spread on the
floor, all knelt down and prayed for about an hour, after
which the pyre was secretly set on fire ; the further wall of the
cave opened, the air resounded with strains, now gay, now
lugubrious, and a long procession of spectres, phantoms,
angels, and demons defiled past the neophyte like the ' supers
' in a pantomine. Whilst this farce was going on, the candidate
took the following oath : —' In the name of Christ crucified, I
swear to burst the bonds that yet unite me to father, mother,
brothers, sisters, relations, friends ; to the King, magistrates,
and any other authority, to which I may ever have sworn
fealty, obedience, gratitude, or service. I renounce... the place
of my birth, henceforth to exist in another sphere. I swear to
reveal to my new superior, whom I desire to know, what I
have done, thought, read, learnt, or discovered, and to observe
and watch all that comes under my notice. I swear to yield
myself up to my superior, as if I were a corpse, deprived of
life and will. I finally swear to flee temptation, and to reveal
all I succeed in discovering, well aware that lightning is not
more rapid and ready than the dagger to reach me wherever I
may be. '
" The new member having taken this oath, was then
introduced into a neighbouring cell, where he took a bath, and
was clothed in garments of new and white linen. He finally
repaired with the other brethren to a banquet, where he could
with choice food and wine compensate himself for his long
abstinence, and the horrors and fatigues he had passed
through. "

THE ORDER OF THE JESUITS

" In 1614, there was published at Cracow what purported to
be the Secret Instructions given to members of the Society of
Jesus. It is said that Hieronymus Zahorowski, who had
recently severed his connection with the society, published
the book with the co-operation of Count George Zbaraski and
other Polish enemies of the order but the repudiation of the
work by the society is no conclusive evidence of its
spuriousness as it has been its policy from the beginning to
deny all discreditable reports and to take the chance of being
proved unveracious. " 6
It will suffice to give the headings of the chapters forming
the Book of Secret Instructions of the Society of Jesus. 7 " The
Preface specially warns superiors not to allow it to fall into
the hands of strangers, as it might give them a bad opinion of
the Order. The Chapters are headed as follows : — I. How the
Society is to proceed in founding a new establishment. — II.
How the Brethren of the Society may acquire and preserve the
friendship of Princes and other distinguished Personages. —
III. How the Society is to conduct itself towards those who
possess great influence in a state ; and who, though they are
not rich, may yet be of service to others. — IX. Hints to
Preachers and Confessors of Kings and great personages. —
V. What conduct to observe towards the clergy and other
religious orders. — VI. How to win over rich widows. — VII.
How to hold fast widows and dispose of their property. —
VIII. How to induce the children of widows to adopt a life of
religious seclusion. — IX. Of the increase of College revenues. — X. Of the private rigour of discipline to be observed
by the society. — XI. How ' Ours ' shall con6. Schaff-Herzog, op. cit, Art. Jesuits.

duct themselves towards those that have been dismissed from
the society. — XII. Whom to keep and make much of in the
society. — XIII. How to select young people for admission
into the society, and how to keep them there. — XIV. Of
reserved cases, and reasons for dismissing from the society.
— XV. How to behave towards nuns and devout women. —
XVI. How to pretend contempt for riches. — XVII. General
means for advancing the interests of the society.
" The intermeddling of this society in the affairs, political,
ecclesiastical and civil, of many countries, is related in
numerous works, and repeatedly produced the suppression
and expulsion of the order, though it constantly reappeared
with new names. In 1716 the French army was infested with
Jesuitical and anti-Jesuitical societies. The Parliament of
Paris suppressed them in 1762.
" They were abolished by papal bull in 1773 at the demand
of France, Spain, Portugal, Parma, Naples and Austria. They
are, however, still to be found every-1 here, and they hold
considerable property in England. A modern writer justly
calls them the ' Black International. ' "
Historically, the Jesuits are given credit for the Gunpowder
Plot of 1605, fomenting the Thirty Years war, the
encouragement of the aspiration of Mary Stuart which led to
her execution, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis
XIV, 1685, and numerous other great events of history.
The Sanfedesti. was founded at the epoch of the suppression of the Jesuits for the defence of religion, the
privileges and jurisdiction of Rome and the temporal power
of the popes. Their successors were the Calderari, referred to
in Chapter LXX.

THE DEFENDERS
(ROMAN CATHOLIC)

(Founded 1562)

This Irish Catholic organization, similar to that of the
Spanish Guarduna, was founded in 1562 by Roger Moore
behind whom were French and Spanish Jesuits.
According to Captain Pollard, author of The Secret
Societies of Ireland, " The nominal function of the Defenders
was the protection of the fugitive priests during the period of
proscription and the holding of the passes while Mass was
celebrated in some mountain glen. The enemies of the faith
being the Protestants, and the Protestants standing for the
Constitutional authority of Britain, the Defenders soon
became a criminal association of law-breakers and banditti.
";
In 1641 they rose and massacred many Protestants, but
were duly crushed by Cromwell in 1649.
This Irish Catholic element was already opposed by the
Roman Catholic Archbishop Plunket, of whom Captain
Pollard writes : " Archbishop Oliver Plunket, Roman
Catholic Primate of Ireland, who had attempted to put down
the criminal association of Defenders in

the South of Ireland, was accused by the infamous Oates; and
at his trial at Westminster certain of these Irish priests, who
had been censured by him, gave false evidence against him.
The Archbishop, though innocent, was, through the false
evidence of these members of the secret society, sentenced
and duly hanged at Tyburn. "

ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS (A. O. H.)
(ROMAN CATHOLIC)

(Founded 1641)
In The Secret Societies of Ireland Captain Pollard writes
that, founded in 1641, "The notorious modern society known
as The Ancient Order of Hibernians is the direct successor of
the original society of Defenders ; in common with its
ancestor it attempts to enable the clerics to exercise control in
politics.1 It claims in its own official history, published in
1910, to be the oldest secret society in Ireland. Independent
researches show that the claim is sound and that the present A.
0. H. is the descendant of certain criminal organizations of
the past. The open admission of this chain of descent by its
own historian is important. American sources trace the A. 0.
H. to 1565 but the date 1641 is that more commonly accepted.
"2
" The Jesuit influence in the development of the Defenders
was reinforced, and their ceremonies and symbolism slowly
changed to an elementary ritual
1. Pollard, op. tit., p. 3.
2. Ibid., p. no.
323

324

OCCULT THEOCRASY

closely modelled on that of the ceremony of initiation to the
Society of Jesus of the period. This ritual has descended with
many accretions and modernisations to the present time ; and
the American branch of the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
misled by it, traces its origin back, not to 1641 and the
Guarduna, but to 1563 and the foundation of the Society of
Jesus. 3
" The A. 0. H. of America is powerfully organized and has
over six thousand lodges, and it is said by Heckethorn to be
divided into two degrees ; in the first no oath is exacted and
no real secret communicated. The second or inner degree is
confined to officials, who receive their passwords and signs
from the Board of Erin in Ireland, who send an emissary
every three months. " 4
In 1878, the American order split into two groups. Shortly
afterwards the Irish followed suit.
" In America the breach was later healed, but in Ireland it
continued until 1902, when a conference was called and both
parties agreed to work under a joint board of control
representing both sections. This board was termed the A. 0. H.
Board of Erin. "5
Another split, occurring in 1905, lasted two years.
" Ten years ago, the real A. 0. H. of Ireland represented a
powerful Nationalist weapon, hostile to the forces of
extremism and devoted to the Irish Parliamentary party, but
the Board of Erin A. 0. H. was revolutionary. " 6

JANSENISM
(Founded 1638)

This was a peculiar form of Calvinism inaugurated by
Cornelius Jansenius (1585-1638) from Louvain in the
Netherlands.
The doctrine of Jansenism is exposed in a work called
Augustinus, written by Jansenius, and published after his
death in 1640.
According to Jansenius' theory of Predestination, man was
either saved or damned according to God's own will,
regardless of his merits or demerits.
From the Low Countries, Jansenism penetrated into France
and its chief centre was in the Port Royal abbey near Paris. It
was Duvergier de Hauranne who had been a great friend of
Jansenius during their student days who, as abbot of Saint
Cyran, introduced Jansenism into Port Royal.
Antoine Arnauld was the leader of the Jansenists and was
followed by Pasquier Quesnel. Many great minds of the
seventeenth century were Jansenists, among them Le Maitre
de Sacy, Blaise Pascal, Lancelot, Nicole and Fontaine,
Secretary of State of Louis XV.
Jansenism, which had undergone severe treatment in
France under Louis XIV, revived under the Regency
325

326

THEOCRASY

in 1715, and found supporters among the learned and the high
clergy against the policy of the Pope.
It is during this period that among the Jansenist sectarians
there arose the strange occurrences practised by what is
known as the Convulsionaries of St. Medard.
The Jansenist party was very rich thanks to the boite a
Perrette (Perrette's box). This was a special fund whence
Jansenism took out all the money for its political and other
needs. It had taken its name from the servant of Mr. Nicole, a
leading Jansenist, who had started the fund and confided the
care of it to his servant. In 1778 it amounted already to 1100
livres and in 1865 was still very substantial.
Modern Jansenism, which, since the 18th century, had its
chief seat in the Netherlands, principally Utrecht, joined in
1889 the German party of the Old Catholics founded in 1871
which, supported by Bismarck, had been one of the elements
leading him to his Kul-1 turkampf policy against the Catholic
Church and institutions.

CAMISARDS OF THE CEVENNES
(Originating 1688)
The Camisards were actually a survival of the Wal-1 denses
and the Pastoureaux.
Calmeil, an authority on mental aberrations quoted by
Madden in Phantasmata1', thus describes the characteristics
of the Camisard movement: — " The prophetic madness (of
the Camisards) made its appearance in Dauphine and Vivarais
in 1688 ; it very soon spread itself over a vast number of
places, and continued without any interruption among the
Calvinists for nearly twenty years.
" It was especially in the course of the year 1689, that the
phenomena of theomania excited the greatest astonishment
and rose to the height of its violence. The theomaniacs could
then be counted by hundreds ; men, women, girls, boys,
young children, all of them believed they were inspired and
imbued with the breath of the Holy Spirit.
" The punishment of fire, the rack, the torture of the
pendaison, even the massacres performed by armed troops,
whose efforts were directed to the extermination

OCCULT THEOCRASY

of the pretended prophets, the military executions, all the
torments that it was possible to invent, to repress the violence
of this religious fanaticism, only augmented the force of the
evil which they were employed to abate or suppress.
" When, towards the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the Calvinists rose up in good earnest to constitute small
bodies of troops, and to dispute inch by inch the soil which
had given them birth, with the king's soldiery, by whom they
were confronted, this war of extermination was preceded by
the apparition of a sort of swarm of pretended prophets and
prophetesses. Towards 1701, at one time two hundred of the
inspired, who had fallen into the hands of their enemies, were
sent to the galleys.
" The madness of the theoma,niacs was less talked of
during the years 1703 and 1704 than it had been previously;
but it is certain that all the armed bands who contended with
the royal troops for those two years, never took the field
except at the instance of some inspired celebrities. And it is
certain that the words of those prophets were listened to as if
they had emanated from the mouth of the Holy Spirit; that the
inspirations of these monomaniacs habitually decided either
the life or death of the Catholics who fell into the power of the
Protestants ; and there was often at that time to be seen the
same person fulfilling among the Camisards the functions of a
prophet, and the functions of a commander.
" It was not till the year 1704 that the Marechal de Villars
had the charge of the command in Langue-1 doc; this
Marechal saw, nevertheless, entire cities infested with
theomania. " 2
2. Madden, op. cit., vol. II, p. 532 et seq.

CAMISARDS OF THE CEVENNES

329

" It was towards the latter end of 1706 that they (the
Camisards) came to England, from the mountains of the
Cevennes, where their countrymen had for a considerable
time maintained a contest with the troops for the persecuting
Louis XIV. As exiles for conscience ' sake, they were treated
with respect and kindness ; but they soon forfeited all claim to
respect by the folly or knavery of their conduct. Of this group
Elias Marion was the prominent figure ; the others acting only
subordinate parts. He loudly proclaimed that he was the
messenger of Heaven, and was authorised to denounce
judgments, and to look into futurity. All kinds of arts were
employed by Marion and his associates to excite public
attention — sudden droppings down as though death-struck;
sighs and groans, and then shrieks and vociferations, on
recovering; broken sentences, uttered in unearthly tones ;
violent contortions ; and desperate strugglings with the spirit,

" After a time the sect which they had formed died away,
but its ruin was less to be attributed to the punishment of the
prophets, or the recovery of reason by their votaries, than by a

Socinianism, and destroy orthodoxy. " 3

THE RITE OF SWEDENBORG OR
ILLUMINATI OF STOCKHOLM
(Founded 1721)

Emmanuel Swedenborg was born on Jan. 29, 1688, at
Stockholm. His father, Jasper Swedberg, was the son of
Daniel Isaksson of Fahlun, Sweden. In 1719, Jasper
Swedberg's family was ennobled by Queen Ulrika and his
name was altered from Swedberg to Swedenborg. l
Emmanuel Swedenborg was initiated at Lund in 1706 and
progressed to the higher degrees of the Templars as practised
in Sweden.
In 1718, Colonel Baltzer Wedmar, in a Stockholm Lodge
Lecture, said that Swedenborg was a Mason and that he had
seen his signature at the Lodge at Lund. These assertions
were confirmed by King Gustavus III.
Founded in 1721, 2 the Rite was first introduced into
England by Chastanier, Springer (Swedish Consul), C. F.
and August Nordenskjold and others who were

members of the first Swedenborgian Society in London
known as the Theosophical Society of the New Jerusalem,
not to be confused with the Rite of French Theosophists.
The rite was carried from London to the Americas by a
Swedenborgian Minister, Brother Samuel Beswick. He lived
at Strathroy, Canada, and was the author of a work upon the
Swedenborgian Rite. This rite, called the Illuminati of
Stockholm, was well known until the middle of the 18th
century when it amalgamated with that of Zinnendorf
What is properly known as the rite of Swedenborg was
another modification of the order of the Illuminati of
Avignon effected by the Marquis de Thome, in 1783, wherein
he endeavoured to restore the true meaning of the doctrine of
the Swedish mystic. ;

SUPREME CONSEIL AND GRAND ORIENT DE
FRANCE
(Founded 1725)
SOVEREIGN GRAND COMMANDER,
SUPREME CONSEIL
1929,
M. RENE RAYMOND.

Freemasonry was introduced in France in about 1730,
some say 1725.
Its implantation bore a singular character. Due to the time
of exile spent in France by Queen Henrietta, widow of
Charles I (1649), English ways and customs had become
fashionable among the members of the French aristocracy.
The exiled English Royal Family and their adherents, warmly
welcomed by the Jesuits of France, plotted in secret to regain
the throne for Charles II. Later, when the Catholic King
James II was also overthrown in 1688, he found refuge in
France and his son, The Pretender, and later his grandson,
Charles Edward, headed numerous plots fomented to enable
them to regain their father's and grandfather's throne from
William of Orange.
Meanwhile Masonry had been instituted in England (1717)
and introduced in France in 1730. The Jacobites, partisans of
the Pretender, secretly plotting as
333

334

OCCULT THEOCRASY

they constantly were, found the newly created Masonic
lodges a ground no less well adapted to serve their ends than
the Jesuits' colleges whence all their schemes emanated.
Lodges, having thus become fashionable resorts for French
aristocrats, presented a double aspect, one which might
almost be termed theatrical, inasmuch as the comedy of
equality between the lord and his varlet was enacted in the
Lodge, and the other far more serious was of a political
character. This latter aspect of budding English symbolic
Freemasonry in France was anxiously watched by the
minister Cardinal de Fleury who ordered its suppression in
1737. Up to that time the French lodges that had been formed
considered themselves as depending from the English Grand
Lodge, had an English Grand Master and were confining their
activities to the practice of the three grades of Blue Masonry.
Then appeared the would-be reformers of Masonry. At
their head, in France, was the Chevalier de Ramsay, and with
their advent came the innovation of a fourth grade followed
by others. This was the beginning of Scotch Masonry whose
unavowed aim seems to have been to interpose itself between
the existing Lodges and the governing Grand Lodge of
France.
De Ramsay, who was one of the foremost exponents of
Scotch Rites and already dreamed of the Universal Masonry
of Albert Pike, exposed some of his theories in his famous
Discourse made in 1740.
By that time, the Grand Lodge of France, known as the
Grand English Lodge of France, was no longer headed by an
English Grand Master, but by the Due d'Antin who was
succeeded by Louis, Prince de Bourbon, Comte de Clermont,
who held the office of Grand Master from 1743 until 1771.
During his Grand Master-

SUPREME CONSEIL

335

ship, in 1754, the name Chapter of Clermont was given to
what might be called an offshoot of the Primitive French
Masonry on which, later, the Chevalier de Bonneville grafted
some additional degrees. This name " Chapter of Clermont "
has been the cause of much confusion arising from the fact
that a Jesuit college founded in Paris, in 1550, also bore the
name of Clermont College and had been a centre for Jacobite
secret plotting against the Protestant rulers of England.1
This grafting of higher degrees on those of Symbolic or
Blue Masonry gave Scotch Masonry its vitality and strength
and a continual superposition and absorption of one rite, to
and by another, took place.
The period during the Grandmastership of the Comte de
Clermont was eventful for the craft. A masonic writer,
William H. Peckham, in his work on Scottish rites, gives a
succinct but clear sequence of some of the changes undergone
by Masonry in France mentioning Thory, Le Blanc, de
Marconnay, Ragon and Clavel as his sources. Thus we learn
that the English Grand Lodge of France became the " Grande
Loge du Royaume " in 1756, and declared itself independent;
further, that an inner body known as the Supreme Council of
the Emperors of the East and West had been founded in 1754
by the Chevalier de Bonneville. It had its chamber in the
Grand Lodge of France and, likewise, was under the authority
of the Grand Master
1. Rev. E. Cahill, S. J., Freemasonry and the Anti-Christian Movement, p.
213, definitely refutes the story of certain Masonic authorities by whom it
has been alleged that The Chapter of Clermont was founded in the Jesuit
College of that name. He states that it was " founded in 1754 and was
named the Chapter of Clermont' manifestly borrowing its name from the
title of the Masonic Grand Master who in fact became its head. "

Comte de Clermont whose substitute Chaillon de Join-ville
was also that of the Council.
The Supreme Council of the Emperors of the East and
West practised twenty-five degrees.
As to the disorders in the bosom of Masonry they are
attributed to the negligence of the Comte de Clermont who, in
1744, had ceased to take much interest in the Lodges and
delegated his authority to two appointees, one a banker named
Baure and the other a dancing master by the name of Lacorne
who sold charters and degrees. The latter caused a scission in
the Grand Lodge whose members rejected him and he formed
an independent Grand Lodge. Both these Grand Lodges, as
also the Council of the Emperors of the East and West,
constituted Lodges and granted charters throughout the
kingdom, but in 1772, the Council united again with the
primitive Grand Lodge as of yore, and becoming one body
they practised the right of perfection of twenty-five degrees.
At that time, the Grand Master was the Due de Chartres, later
Philippe Egalite, Due d'Orleans, who had succeeded the
Comte de Clermont in 1771.
But ten years previously, on August 29, 1761, a Jew,
Stephen Morin, had obtained a charter from the Council of the
Emperors of the East and West and had gone to America as
Grand Inspector General. There he founded what is now
known as Scottish Bites. Morin held his authority from the
Comte de Clermont who, at the request of Lacorne, charged
him with establishing Masonry in all parts of the world. His
patent was signed by Chaillon de Joinville, Prince de Rohan,
Lacorne, Savalette de Buckolay, Taupin, Brest De La
Chaussee, Count de Choiseul, Chevalier de Lenon-court and
D'Aubertin2.

The early history of French Freemasonry is a maze of
quarrels, but finally, in 1766, under the auspices of a new
Grande Loge Nationale de France, afterwards called the
Grand-Orient, a representative system was at last adopted but
the quarrels continued, the Orient and the original Grand
Lodge being each supported by a separate Rosicrucian
organization besides its own proper lodges. 3
In contradiction to other masonic authorities, Yarker
makes the assertion that the primitive Scottish Rite of 33
degrees was established at Namur in 1770 by Marchot and in
1787 united with the Grand Orient.4
In he Culte de la Nature dans la Franc-magonnerie
Universelle (page 143) D. Margiotta states that Adam
Weishaupt and his favorite, Baron von Knigge, introduced the
organization of the Holy Vehm as well as certain legends of
Illuminism into Masonry in 1783. The only persons exempted
from the jurisdiction of this terrible court of " Justice ", the
Holy Vehm, were the clergy, women and children, Jews and
heathens and certain members of the higher nobility.
The Revolution issued from the Masonic Lodges, said
Lombard de Langes. France, in 1789, counted over 2,000
lodges affiliated to the Grand Orient : The adepts numbered
over 100,000. The first events of 1789 were but Masonry in
action. All the Revolutionaries of the Constituent Assembly
were 3rd degree initiates.
In the Viennese Freemasonic newspaper of December
1927, the Freemason Arthur Singer of Budapest publishes the
following interesting document which he claims to have
taken from a book by Comte Vogt

d'Hunolstein, which appeared in 1864 under the title
Unpublished letters of Marie-Antoinette.
It is a letter from the unhappy queen to her sister Marie
Christine.
Translation.
" I believe that as far as France is concerned, you worry too
much about Freemasonry. Here, it is far from having the
significance that it may have elsewhere in Europe ; here
everything is open and one knows all. Then, where could the
danger be ?
" One might well be worried if it were a question of a
political secret society. But on the contrary the government
lets it spread, and it is only that which it seems : an association,
the objects of which are union and charity. One dines, one
sings, one talks, which has given the king occasion to say that
people who drink and sing are not suspect of organizing plots.
Nor is it a society of atheists, for, we are told, God is on the
lips of all. They are very charitable. They bring up the
children of the poor and dead members, they endow their
daughters. What harm is there in all that ?
" A short time ago the Princess de Lamballe was named
Grand Mistress of a Lodge. She told me all the charming
things they said to her. Many glasses were emptied, many
verses sung. Then two good young maidens were endowed.
Admitted. One can do good without all that fuss : but one
must let everyone act according to their wishes, the more so
when good only only results. "
The letter sounds as if it had been written yesterday by one
of our good English Masons concerning English
Freemasonry.
Masonry in France became dormant during the French
Revolution, but in 1799, a national union was effected

SUPREME CONSEIL

339

by Roettiers. No sooner, however, was this done, and the
statutes, originally based on the English constitutions
thoroughly revived, than French masonry again suffered from
an invasion of mysticism, — first in the form of the Scottish
Philosophic Rite (including such profundities as the luminous
ring and the white and black Eagle), and secondly in the
American Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33 degrees,
which the charlatan De Grasse-Tilly expounded with great
success but which in 1804 was amalgamated with the Grand
Orient, the great Marshals Massena and Kellerman being then
the leading members of the two bodies. The union did not last,
as Napoleon disliked the constitution of the Supreme Council
which was largely influenced by the aristocracy. His brother,
Joseph, assisted by Murat and Cambaceres, was allowed to
take office in the older organization. During the reactionary
Catholic policy of the Grand Master Murat the younger
(1852-62), the liberties of the Orient were greatly interfered
with and its funds almost exhausted. Since then it has slowly
recovered. 5
Murat was succeeded by General Magnan who had been
appointed by Napoleon III to group all Masonic bodies into
one. This he succeeded in doing in 1862 with the exception of
Scottish Rites, then under Jean Baptist Viennet, which still
held aloof.
In 1868, the Supreme Conseil (of Scottish Rites) and the
Alliance Israelite Universelle became merged in the person of
the Jew Adolphe Cremieux who was president of both.
We must not omit to mention that Cremieux was also a
member of the Rite of Mizraim which in 1862 was absorbed
by the Grand Orient of France.

They were : — Emmanuel Arago, Cremieux, Jules Favre,

THE CONVULSIONARIES OF ST. MEDARD (Founded
1731)
St. Medard was the name of a cemetery in Paris wherein
was the tomb of a famous Jansenist, the deacon Francois de
Paris, and it was said that miracles of all descriptions took
place there.
The first recorded case of convulsions in the St. Medard
cemetery occurred in August 1731.
On this subject, Madden tells us the following : —
" The tomb of the deacon Francois became the scene of
wonderful cures, and some very remarkable conversions,
which were reputed miraculous. People who came there,
especially afflicted with nervous disorders, appear to have
been affected in a singular manner, some with cataleptic,
others with hysteric and convulsive symptoms. l
" The convulsionnaires exhibited not only occasionally,
but frequently, all the phenomena which are ascribed by
mesmerists to animal magnetism, somnambulism, ecstasies,
raptures, submission of the will and the senses to the power of
the volition of another person, connected in some way with
the dominant idea

which possessed their minds at the time of falling into the
trance. Increased subtlety of thought, quickness of perception,
heightened powers of imagination, a vivid energizing
influence, fraught with enthusiasm and even eloquence ;
claims to clairvoyance, to communion with another world, to
' spirit life ' ; all these phenomena were to be found too,
though not all in the same individual, in occasional instances
in this epidemic of convulsive theomania...
" Till the month of August, 1731 ", says Picart, " the
wonders wrought at the burying place of the deacon Paris
were not accompanied with any considerable difference from
those mentioned in Scripture or ecclesiastical history. Those
who were afflicted with sickness, and begged the holy
deacon's intercession, were laid upon or under his tomb-stone,
which was raised from the ground, and were cured. But in
August, 1731, God was pleased to work his miracles in a
different manner ; violent pains, agitations of the body,
extraordinary convulsions, were the means by which the sick
were healed, not all at once, but gradually. This happened to
one Abbe Becheran, to Chevalier Follard, an ancient officer
in the army, and to several others. The number of people
afflicted with convulsions increased so fast, and
consequences of the meetings at the tomb appeared, or were
represented to the King, so dangerous, that on the 27th of
January, 1732, he issued an order to shut up the little
churchyard belonging to St. Medard's parish, where M. de
Paris was buried, and to open it only when necessary for
burials. Some weeks afterwards, the Abbe Becheran was
arrested and confined at St. Lazare, and set again at liberty
about three months after in June. But the miracles and convulsions did not cease upon these oppositions ; on the
contrary, they daily spread further, and gained ground.

THE CONVULSIONARIES OF ST.

MEDARD

345

" Towards the end of the year 1732, those who were jn
convulsions began to foretell what was to happen, to discover
secrets, to make speeches, pathetic exhortations, sublime
prayers; even those who at other times were wholly unable to
perform any such things. 2
" Montgeron informs us : ' There is nothing which the
convulsionnaires did not undertake to mortify themselves, to
break down and to enfeeble their bodies. The most of those
from the time they had convulsions, hardly made use of a bed;
they laid down with their clothes on, winter and summer, with
only one covering, some lying on planks, and others on the
bare ground, others on logs of wood, and some of them on
bars of iron. '
" The fact is, not only the means used for effecting cures
were evil in themselves, but many of the leading persons by
whom the remedy of the Grand Secours was administered or
superintended were persons of ill repute. 3
" Montgeron reckons that four thousand enthusiasts were
employed to kick, and to strike without cessation the infirm,
and all those young girls who begged for the violence of their
blows. ' They were not ashamed to maintain' says Calmeil '
that it was to be ignorant of pious and charitable duties, not to
obey under these circumstances the desires of the
convulsionnaires whilst the reasonable Jansenists repeated
aloud, that it was only a frantic madness which could suggest
to these young women to encounter such dangers, and make
an excuse for the criminal barbarity of those who had the
audacity to boast of the advantages of so scandalous a mode
of mortification, or rather martyr

dom, and the wickedness to consent to take on them the
office of executioners'.
" An observer has recounted that a young girl named Jeanne
Mouler, had insisted upon their administering to her as many
as a hundred blows with an andiron, on the stomach, and that a
brother, who had one day given her sixty, had caused a breach
in a wall at the twenty-fifth blow, and then went on repeating
the same violence on her person which had been previously
inflicted upon her. Montgeron, acknowledging that he was the
person designated ' the brother', who inflicted the blows, adds :
' The convulsionnaire continued to complain that the blows
that I was giving her were so slight that they did not bring her
any relief, and she forced me again to put the andiron into the
hands of a large strong man... This person in no way spared
her. Having seen, by the proof that I had already given, that he
could not administer too violent blows, he bastinadoed her in
so frightful a manner, always in the hollow of the stomach,
that they shook the wall against which she was leaning. 4
" The convulsionnaire made them immediately give her,
with all their force, the hundred lashes that she had already
asked for, counting as nothing, those sixty which I had
already given her. '
" A physician, hearing an account of these things,
maintained that they could not be true, as according to him it
was physically impossible. He objected, amongst other things,
that the flexibility and the softness of the skin and flesh, and
all the other fibrous parts of which the skin and the flesh are
essentially composed, are incompatible with a force and
resistance so extraordinary... They allowed him to make

demonstration, to set forth all his proofs, and in the end, for
reply, they said to him — Come and verify the facts — He
hastened to do so, and at the very sight he was struck with
astonishment. Scarcely believing his eyes, he begs to
administer himself the secours... They immediately put into
his hands the iron instruments, the strongest and the fittest to
beat effectually ; He spared nothing, he struck with the
greatest violence, he thrust into the flesh the instrument with
which he was armed, he made it penetrate beyond the surface...
Notwithstanding which, the convulsionnaire laughed at all his
vain efforts ; all the blows which he gave her only served to do
her good, without leaving the slightest impression, the least
trace, or any vestige whatever, not only in the flesh, but even
on the skin itself ".
Among other duly attested cases of torture to which the
Convulsionnaires submitted the most astonishing are those
of crucifixion and burning. 5
Like the Fakirs of India, these people seemed to have
achieved invulnerability and the power to defy nature !
Science, so far, has still to find a satisfactory explanation of
this phase of phenomena.
Hippolyte Blanc, another writer, records the following
observations : —
" The girl Sonet, nicknamed ' The Salamander', was seen to
rest in the flames for 36 minutes on one occasion without
sustaining any burns. 6
" The mania of the convulsionnaires broke out at St.
Medard, in the spring of 1731. The royal order, which caused
the cemetery of St. Medard to be closed and the pretended
miracles to cease, was issued in January, 1732. "

In 1733, the Due d'Anjou, the infant son of Queen Marie

which caused his death.
In Phantasmata, already quoted, we read further : ______.
" From 1732 onward the delirium of theomania began to
manifest itself more signally than it had hitherto done, by
ecstatic phenomena, and cataleptic symptoms, by predictions,
and pretensions to miraculous operations, in the same way as
the Calvinist convulsionnaires progressed in their fanaticism
in the Cevennes, when they were interfered with by the civil
authorities ; and many of their chiefs were imprisoned, as
those of the Jansenists of St. Medard were immured in the
Bastille, and the Bicetre. The plea or the pretext of
persecution, and the consequent assemblage of the
convulsionnaires of Paris in secret, concurred greatly and
rapidly to augment the evils which it was intended to prevent
by those governmental measures. And those evils were not
effectually repressed during the following ten years. Nor were
they totally then put a stop to. It was of no avail that, in the
year 1762, the ' Grand Secours ' was forbidden by act of
parliament.
" The insanity of the convulsionnaires ", says Hecker, "
lasted without interruption until the year 1790. "
The convulsionnaires of St. Medard and the Cami-sards
were only manifestations of Gnosticism such as have existed
in the esoteric branches of various sects, religious and secret
societies ever since the days of Paganism.
Among others can be mentioned : The Albigenses, The
Moravian Brethren, The Anabaptists, the Baptists, the
Quakers, The Waldenses, the Shakers, the Methodists etc.

THE ROYAL ORDER OF SCOTLAND

The Royal Order of Scotland is composed of two degrees

Cross.
The antiquity and origin of " Mother Kilwinning " is a
favourite theme with Masonic authors according to whom the
degree of Heredom of Kilwinning was founded in the reign of
David I, King of Scotland, and that of Rosy Cross by Robert
Bruce in 1314.
Robert Freke Gould, however, places the date of the
foundation of the Royal Order of Scotland in " the middle of
the last century ", and gives us the name of William Mitchell,
a Scotsman who obtained his patent as its founder from the
Provincial Grand Master of South Britain on July 22, 1750. l

THE

OBSERVANCE

(Founded 1751-52)
The following main facts concerning the Strict Observance
are mostly gathered from the profusely documented work of
R. Le Forestier who, having made a comprehensive study of
the subject, took as one of his chief authorities Nettelbladt.
The Templar rite of the Strict Observance was founded in
1751 by Charles Gotthelf, Baron de Hund (born 1722)
Chamberlain and Councillor of the Elector of Saxony, King
of Poland, as well as Councillor of the Empress Maria
Theresa.
In 1764, the Anglo-Jewish adventurer Leucht, variously
known as Johnson, de Martin, Robert de Leich-ten, Becher,
Despocher, de Bousch, Somery, Scheel and Koenig, made an
attempt to amalgamate the Templar System of Clermont, the
control of which he had seized the previous year from Rosa,
with that of von Hund, with the view of dominating the latter
also. In this he failed.
Rosa had been the Legate for Germany, Holland and the
kingdoms of the north while, in Paris, the Comte de Clermont
occupied a similar position with regard to France, Spain,
Portugal and Italy.

THE

STRICT OBSERVANCE

351

The legend of the Strict Observance is very much involved.
Stating that the Stuarts were the unknown superiors of the
Order it claimed descent from Pierre d'Aumont, Banneret
d'Auvergne, at the time of the death of the Grand Master
Jacques de Molay and the successor of Beaujeu, Molay's
nephew who, with two Commanders and five Knights had
escaped to the Island of Mull where they encountered George
Harris, the Grand Commander of Hampton Court, likewise a
refugee. They elected d'Aumont Grand Master and adopted
the costume and customs of Masons in memory of d'Aumont
and his companions who, for two years, had lived thus in
disguise while exercising the trade to earn a livelihood. Not
daring to recruit openly, the Templars were eventually
permitted to marry to perpetuate the order. For over 250 years,
admission to the degree of Scotch Master had been restricted
to the sons of Templars and only within the last 150 years had
the secrets of this order been available to Scotch Masters born
of free parents. D'Aumont was succeeded as Grand Master by
Harris. " 1
According to Le Forestier, again quoting Nettel-bladt, the
initiation ceremony ot the Strict Observance included the
presentation to the postulant of a ribbon to which was
appended a small cross which had been in contact with the
Baphomet.2
At the Convent, sitting from June 4 to 24, 1772, at Kohlo in
the Basse Lusace, it was decided to refuse further obedience
to the illusive " Invisible Superiors" continually referred to by
Hund, and the Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick (Luneburg)

THE MARTINIST ORDER
(Founded 1754)
Martinez Paschalis first founded in Paris an order called
the Elus Cohens or Priests, then in 1754 that of the Martinists.
This order was reformed by Louis Claude de Saint Martin in
1775. It had ten degrees.
St. Martin was on intimate terms with the Illumine Jean
Willermoz who presided at two of the Great Masonic
Conventions — that of Les Gaules in 1768 and that of
Wilhelmsbad in 1782 at which was voted the death of the
King of France.
The Modern Martinist Order was established with three
degrees in Paris in 1887 and was constituted in England in
1902.
Its Grand Master, Marquis Stanislas de Guaita, died in
1897 and was succeeded by T. Ch. Barlet whose successor
was Dr. Encausse, generally known as Papus, who became
the occult adviser of the ill-fated Czar Nicholas II.
Mr. A. E. Waite tells us that, while Papus was its Grand
Master, a Martinist " Supreme Council " was founded with
power for the formation of regular

lodges, male and female members being admitted on equal
terms. This was in 1894. By the year 1899, there were general
and special delegations of the Order established in a number
'of European Countries — Great Britain included — in the
United States, the Argentine and Guatemala and even in more
than one Oriental land.
As regards the Martinist relations with Masonry, Mr. Waite
tells us on page 161, Vol. II, of his New Encyclopaedia of
Freemasonry that Martinism " had of course shut its doors
against Masons under authorized obediences. " Yet we are
able to reproduce (see Appendix IV) a private letter, dated
March 26, 1906, written by " Dorec " to Theodore Reuss 33°
90° 96°, English Mason, etc. in which the latter is incidentally
informed " that John Yarker is our (' the Martinist') delegate in
London. "
Another private letter in which Papus refers to himself as
the Delegate of John Yarker for the Swe-denborg Rite in
France is also in existence. Such a correspondence with one
of the most noteworthy Masons of their day does not look as
if Mr. Waite's information concerning the alleged feud
between Masonry and Martinism can have been very
reliable !
The Martinist sign is :'.:
By 1920, Mr. Waite states that Martinism had abandoned
the Rituals of 1887 and appeared to have become a
clandestine organization!

OF

AVIGNON

(Founded 1760)

The Illuminati of Avignon were founded in 1760 by
Antoine Joseph Pernety, an unfrocked Benedictine, a Cabalist
and alchemist. Modified in 1766 by Chas-tanier, one of the
founders of the English Rite of Swedenborg, this rite was
introduced into Paris in the Lodge Socrates of Perfect Union
under the name of Theosophical Illumines. In 1770, Pernety,
founded La Grande Loge Ecossaise du Comtat Venaissin.
This Lodge was raided in 1774 and its papers confiscated by
order of the Pope. It was revived in 1789 \
Among its members were Cagliostro and his friend Baron
de Corberon, Mesmer, Marquis de Thome and the Marquis de
Puysegur, self-styled Professor of " Mesmerism ".
In Les Illumines d'Avignon by Joanny Bricaud (page 103)
we read that " today, its members having become affiliated to
Martinism, the society has ceased to exist ". This author also

" The Premier Conclave of England, which has existed
from time immemorial, gave rise, it is said, to the foundation
of the Council of ' Emperors of the East and West ', a body
which was established in Paris about the year 1758 and is
considered as the parent of the Antient and Accepted Scottish
Rite. (Compare with page 336).
" The Scottish Rite ", according to Le Forestier, " issued
from the Chapter of Clermont, as a development of the
Ramsay Rite. Its foundation dates from

In its present form, the Rite in France dates from 1804. " At that
date the pecuniary situation of the Grand Central Lodge was
however not up to its pretentions. It was already in debt. Brother de
Grasse had personal debts and Brother Abraham was a man of venal
character. The Grand Orient paid the debts of the Grand Scottish
Lodge and of Brother de Grasse, making a life

" But the one ' mission and object' (Mackey) of Masonry is kept
steadily in view ; which is the worship of the god of this world, who
is Satan, as the ' Grand Architect of the Universe ; ' and to
accomplish this by inventing ' a religion in which all mankind agree ;
' and this, by putting all earth's religions upon a level, and uniting
them together in Masonic worship, which is boldly avowed in
rituals, lexicons, and philosophical degrees. This is (in Revelation,
xm, 14) called the image of the beast, made by ' them, that dwell on
the earth' that is, everybody ; every creed, and no creed ; all who join
the secret lodges. But this world-religion must have some form, and
shape, to hold together ; and be taxed ; hence, it takes the form, or
image, of the beast. Lodge despotism is as absolute as Romish
despotism and is the image of it...
" Note now the profound craft, by which this is to be accomplished, viz., Masonry promises men salvation by ceremonies
invented by men, administered by priests, and inhabited by devils.
This is the sum and substance of all the false religions on earth, and
will ultimately unite them against Christ. But the only opponent
Masonry dreads is Christ, who refused to worship Satan, and his
followers. "

pension of 800 francs to Brother Abraham and proposing the
annexation of the Grand Central Lodge to the Antient and
Accepted Scottish Rite among those recognized by the
Grand Orient. " 4
In 1804, in France, a Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand
Inspectors General of the 33rd degree of the Antient and
Accepted Scottish Rite was duly constituted. In the
construction of this Council, Comte Alexandre F. A. de
Grasse-Tilly, (the son of the Admiral) played a leading part.
He had been initiated in Paris several years before he went to
America where we find him a colonist of San Domingo.
His successor was the Due Decazes.
As regards the development of Scottish Rites in England,
Stillson and Hughan state that : —
" After the Antient and Accepted Scottish Rite had been
established in England, the Templar body resigned control
over the degrees of the ' Rose-Croix ' and ' Kadosch, ' which
then became incorporated with the rite, as the 18th and 30th ;
it was therefore necessary to suppress the old ceremonies and
relegate them to Templar history, but they were still retained
in some of the older English encampments.
A revised ritual was issued in 1851 consequent on the
omission of the ' Rose-Croix ' and ' Kadosch '. 5
Another authority, Paul Rosen, makes the following
comment : —
" The philosophy of the degree of Kadosch (30°), the
apotheosis and real aims of Masonic teaching, can be summed
up in the following words : — I, I alone, All mine, All for me,
by any and every means.

This is the great deception. The success of the entire
system depends on the solid integrity and political and social
prominence of its affiliates whose virtues make them
valuable as decoys.
" Antient and Accepted Scottish Rites " runs its own Secret
Service which cooperates with the national Secret Services of
all countries thus serving the aims and purposes of
Internationalism.
Blanchard, himself a high Mason whose masonic studies
were induced by a keen desire to fathom the truth and impart
the result of his discoveries to those whom he feared might
also be duped, thus sums up Scottish Rites : —
" Let the authoritative teaching of Dr. Mackey be
continually borne in mind, that : — 'the mission and object of
Masonry is the worship of the Great Architect of the Universe
'. It follows that the lodges must have something for their
dupes to do, called worship. And

what could wicked men and devils invent craftier or better
suited to deceive the simple, than this very-scheme of ' the
Ancient Scottish Rite ', which now rules the rites of the world.
It seizes and appropriates all of religion but its holiness and
justice ; and all of Christ but his truth and his atonement. It
mixes things sacred with things profane, till the whole
compound is profanity ; and quoting the Bible' as if it believed
it true, which notoriously it does not, it has furnished a dark
system, which angels flee from and which devils inhabit7.
Every Lodge is a Synagogue of Satan and its ritual is Sorcery.

Anyone interested in the rituals etc. of this rite will find
much that is interesting in D. Margiotta's Le Culte de la

Masonic philosophy is well summarised in the following

Accepted Scottish Rites
" For the Sovereign Grand Inspector General the 33rd is the
last degree of the Rite. The Order is the Great Avenger of the
assassinated Grand Master and the grand champion of
humanity, for the innocent Grand Master is man, man who is
Master, King of Nature, man who is born innocent and
unconscious.
" Our innocent Grand Master was born for happiness and
for the enjoyment of all rights without exception.
"But he has fallen under the blows of three assassins, three
scoundrels have thwarted his happiness and rights and have
annihilated him.

" The three infamous assassins are Law, Property and

" Law, because it is not in harmony with the rights of the
individual man and the duties of social man in society, rights
which belong to all. Duties are but the immediate
consequence of the right inherent in all, for the enjoyment of
all rights.
" Property, because the earth belongs to nobody and its
fruits belong to all in proportion as they are required by each
for the needs of his own well being.
" Religion, because religions are but philosophies evolved
by men of genius and adopted by the people in the belief that
they would increase their well being.
" Neither law, property nor religion can be imposed on man
and as they annihilate him by depriving him of his most
precious rights they are assassins on whom we have sworn to
wreak vengeance, enemies against whom we have declared
war to the death and without quarter.
" Of these three infamous enemies it is on religion that we
must concentrate our most deadly attacks, because no people
has ever survived its religion. Once Religion is dead, Law and
Property will fall to our mercy, and we shall be able to
regenerate society by founding on the corpses of the assassins
of man, Masonic Religion, Masonic Law, and Masonic
Property ". 10

THE

MOPSE

(Founded 1763)
Pope Clement XIV having excommunicated the
Freemasons in 1763, many German Catholics, frightened by
the Papal Bull, definitely renounced the society.
They formed however another association which, while
restoring their former organization, should not expose them to
the censure of the Vatican and, having found a protector in the
person of one of the most august German Sovereigns of the
day, they secured an influential German nobleman as Grand
Master. Many distinguished persons joined the " new " order
which, like the Freemasons, had laws, words, signs of recognition, reception ceremonies and appointed officers.
One of the principal lodges was at Frankfort.
Adherence to the Roman Catholic faith was declared a
requisite of membership, but the rule was not enforced and as
a protection from papal excommunication a promise, instead
of an oath of secrecy, was exacted from candidates.
Women were eligible to any dignity in the order, excepting
that of Grand Master, which position was held for life. There
were two Lodge Masters or Grand
365

Mopses in each lodge, one of which was a man and one a
woman, while the lodge was governed six months by a man
and six months by a woman alternately, 1
In Italy, the Mopses called themselves Xeropha-gists.2
The following is quoted from an article in Freemasonry
Universal Vol. 2, part 4, Spring Equinox, 1927 : —
" Mingled with points clearly stolen from the Masonic
ritual, such as the use of the square and compasses, was the
veneration of a sort of mascot which was a dog, known as the
Mopse, and resembled a rather large pug dog with a curly tail.
" During the ceremony the candidates were admitted
blindfolded and were instructed to kiss something. This was
nothing more nor less than a life sized model of a mopse, and
on the bandage being removed the initiate found that he or she
had kissed the tail end of the dog. Whether the ceremonies
were merely boisterous fooling, or whether they had any
esoteric significance it is difficult to say, as students differ on
the point.
" The Order was certainly at one time wide spread and
popular, but seems to have entirely died out. Probably its
death blow was given by the Revolution, which swept away
so many of the aristocrats of France and brought secret
societies into disrepute, owing ta the supposed share of the
Illuminati in starting that tremendous upheaval. "
The statement in the last paragraph can hardly be accurate
as certain official papers are in existence bearing, as letter

Commander in von Hund's Strict-Observance. Zinnendorf
received the rituals and instructions for this order from a
Swede named Cklack.
On Dec. 27 1770, Zinnendorf formed a Grand Lodge in
Berlin with the cooperation of twelve lodges which had
adopted his opinions. On March 29 of the following year, he
demanded a constitution from the Grand Lodge of London.
This he finally obtained in 1773 through the influence of
Prince Louis George Charles of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Grand
Master of the Lodges following his system. l
The Rite of Zinnendorf was absorbed at the Convent of
Wolfenbuttel in 1778 into the Lodge of the Three Globes of
Berlin.

THE ILLUMINATI OF BAVARIA

371

This society seems to have borne a close resemblance to
the Order of the Golden Cross which was reorganized in
1767.
According to Le Forestier, Illuminism was just as much
Masonry as the system of the Rose Croix, that of the
Templars or the crowd of Masonic French degrees, and it is
wrongfully accused of having taken in Bavaria the cloak of
Masonry.1
The intention of the Founder was to constitute a Protestant
organization to fight Jesuitism, using Jesuitical methods. He
was ably assisted in his efforts by Adolph, Baron von Knigge,
Massenhausen, Bode, Anacharsis Clootz, Fischer, Zwack,
Merz, Hertal, the Marquis de Constanza, Count Saviola,
Bassus, Baron de Montgelas and Nicolai.
Behind Nicola'i was Moses Mendelssohn, and behind
Mendelssohn the Jewish Kahal, the Jewish International
World Government. 2
" Nicola'i had established about the year 1765 at Berlin a
literary review with the object of propagating the pernicious
doctrines of a shallow Illuminism, and, in that, the infancy of
German literature, when this periodical had scarcely a rival to
encounter, the influence it exerted was more extensive than
can at present be even conceived. Bahardt and Basedow, at
the same time, in cheap and popular tracts, scattered among
the lower classes the poison of infidelity ; and they, as well as
Nicola'i, were in close communication with Weishaupt,
carrying on with the most reckless violence, and with the
weapons of a most shameless ribaldry, the warfare
against Christianity.

OCCULT THEOCRASY

The great critic Lessing, the founder of the modern German
literature, lent his powerful support to the anti-Christian
League. While librarian at Wolfenbuttel he edited a work,
composed by Reimarus, consisting of various irreligious
essays entitled Fragments of Wolfenbuttel, and which, from
the tone of earnestness and dialectic acuteness wherein they
were written, exerted a very prejudicial influence over public
opinion. "3
As the organization of the Illuminati developed, so did its
ambitions, which ended in a plot to subvert Freemasonry to
its aim of world dominion by any and all means.
Politically speaking, its tendencies were republican ;
religiously, it was anti-christian. Its members were pledged to
blind obedience to their superiors and this was insured by a
strict system of secret confessions, and monthly reports
checked by mutual espionage. Each individual used a
pseudonym instead of his own name to help disguise his
identity.
But for the Freemason Baron Adolph von Knigge, a
Templar, who succeeded in having it absorbed by
Freemasonry, the order would have perished soon after its
creation.
After obtaining control of certain Masonic Lodges,
Weishaupt and his associates recklessly vaunted their
growing power. Their organization then, soon becoming
permeated by the agents of their enemies, the Jesuits and
Rose Croix Orders, they were denounced to the Elector of
Bavaria, Charles Theodore, by the Duchess Marie-Anne of
Bavaria (Princess Clementine), his cousin whose secretary,
Joseph Utzschneider, had,

THE ILLUMINATI OF BAVARIA

as an Illuminatus, become acquainted with certain methods
of the order.
Constanza had ordered him to hand over certain letters
written by Frederic II to the Duchess Marie-Anne and,
suspecting blackmail, instead of complying with the request,
he denounced the order.
On March 2, 1785, the Elector wrote his second and final
edict, suppressing the order of the Illuminati, but it was not
until July 10, 1785 that incriminating evidence was obtained
on the activities of the sect when one of its members, a priest,
Jacob Lang, was struck dead by lightning while walking with
Weishaupt at Ratisbon. His body was placed in the chapel of
Saint-Emmeran and a Benedictine found some documents
and a list of the members of the Illuminati sewn in his clothes.
These he handed over to the Councillor of the Government of
Upper Bavaria.
More papers were found when the authorities, who were
watching Zwack's relations with a certain Jew, Mayer, the
superintendent of Bassus' chateau of San-dersdorf, near
Ingolstadt, decided to raid the place, and in 1787 the judge
charged with the inventory of the succession of the valet of
Baron Maendl, the Chamberlain of the Elector, found among
his effects an iron box full of papers concerning the
Illuminati.
This discovery, Maendl, himself an Illuminatus, was
summoned to explain. Among the details of his evidence is
the statement that the Lodge Bader had 97 degrees. The
coincidence of this number becomes of interest when
compared with the 97 degrees of Memphis sent to England
in 1762 by the Grand Orient of France.
When Weishaupt was banished from Bavaria by his
sovereign, he was received at the court of the Duke
Ernest-Louis de Saxe-Gotha who, besides a pension, gave
him the title of Honorary Councillor.

374

OCCULT THEOCRASY

The Marquis of Constanza, his secretary, and Count
Saviola, the Keeper of the Archives of the order, two Italian
accomplices, were also banished with pensions of 400 and
800 florins respectively, and as Illumi-nism was already said
to have found its way into Italy, there is no reason to suppose
that these gentlemen failed in their administration of the
subsidy.
In 1788, after the suppression of Illuminism in Bavaria,
Bahrdt and Knigge attempted to revive it in the " German
Union " but it was not till 1810 that it really reappeared in
Germany, this time under the name of The Tugendbund.
The introduction of Illuminism into Prance was effected by
the Marquis de Mirabeau who, during his residence in
Germany, was initiated by Mauvillon, a professor of the
Caroline college at Brunswick. He rose high in the order, and,
on his return to France in September 1788, initiated the Due
d'Orleans, who was Grand Master of the Freemasons of that
country, and also Talleyrand.
Frost, in Secret Societies of the European Revolution refers
to Barruel as asserting " that the whole of the Masonic lodges
comprised in the Grand Orient, 266 in number, were '
illuminated ' by the end of March 1789 and there is no doubt
that, with the ground so well prepared by the works of
Voltaire and Bousseau, d'Alembert and Diderot, and with the
example and influence of the Duke of Orleans, and the
exertions of men such as Mirabeau, Talleyrand, Sieyes, and
Con-dorcet, the system spread with rapidity. " 4

The following curious piece of information is furnished by Le
Grand Dictionnaire Universel du XDC Siecle by Larousse in the
article on " Illuminisme " : —
" The Illuminati did not disappear after the last century. They are
still to be found in Germany, England and Russia where they have
formed a queer sect in which castration is one of the features of
initiation. The taste for the supernatural, the passion of the marvellous constantly urge these mentally unbalanced men in whom
the imagination is fanaticised, to throw themselves into the fantastic
visions which constitute Illu-minism. "

TUGENDBUND

(Founded 1786)

The name of Tugendbund or Union of Virtue was first
given to the association of men and women who met at the
house of the Jewess Henrietta Herz whose husband, Marcus
Herz, a Jewish Illuminatus, was the disciple, friend and
successor of Moses Mendelssohn. Noted Illuminati were
frequenters of this abode of licentiousness about which
Graetz, the Jewish historian, wrote :
" The salon of the beautiful Henrietta Herz became a sort of
Midianite tent. Here a number of young Jewish women
assembled whose husbands were kept away by their business.
The most prominent male member of this circle was
Frederick von Gentz, the embodiment of selfishness,
licentiousness, vice and depravity whose chief occupation
was the betrayal of women. l
" A so-called Band of Virtue (Tugendbund) was formed of
which Henrietta Herz, two daughters of Moses Mendelssohn
2
and other Jewesses together with Christian profligates were
members. "

He also adds that " Mirabeau, in whose mind the
storm-charged clouds of the Revolution were already
forming, and to whom the Jews owed so much during his
secret diplomatic embassy (1786) to Berlin, was more in the
society of Henrietta Herz than in that of her husband. "
Other frequenters of this salon were William von
Humboldt, Jean Paul Richter, Schleiermacher, a foremost
Moravian brother, and his friend Frederick Schlegel.
Later, in 1807, a second Tugendbund or Union of Virtue
was formed, a purely political league of which Thomas Frost
wrote : —
" The nucleus of the Association devised by von Stein
which received the name of the Tugendbund, or League of
Virtue, was formed during the latter months of 1807. His
colleagues, Hardenberg and Scharnhorst; Generals
Wittgenstein and Blucher ; Jahn, a Professor of the Berlin
Gymnasium, and Arndt, the popular author, were amongst the
earliest members. The initiations multiplied rapidly, and the
League soon numbered in its ranks most of the Councillors of
State, many officers of the army, and a considerable number of
the professors of literature and science. By the active and
zealous exertions of Stein, Hardenberg and Jahn, its
ramifications spread quickly from the Baltic to the Elbe, and
all classes were drawn within its influence. A central
directorate at Berlin, presided over by Stein, had the supreme
control of the movement, and exercised, through provincial
committees, an authority all the more potent from emanating
from an unknown source, and which was obeyed as implicitly
as the decrees of Emperor or King. " 3

With Heckethorn, we follow the Tugendbund further,
for he tells us that after its suppression by the police of
Napoleon I, the Tugendbund continued " concealing
itself however more strictly than before in the masonic
brotherhood. " 4
One of its first acts " was to send auxiliary corps to assist
the Russians in the campaign of 1813. Prussia having, by the
course of events, been compelled to abandon its temporizing
policy, Gneisenau, Scharn-horst and Grollmann embraced
the military plan of the Tugendbund. A levy en masse was
ordered. The conduct of these patriots is matter of history.
But, like other nations, they fought against Napoleon to
impose on their country a more tyrannical government than
that of the foreigner had ever been. They fought as men only
fight for a great cause, and those who died fancied they saw
the dawn of German freedom. But those who survived saw
how much they were deceived. The Tugendbund, betrayed in
its expectations, was dissolved ; but its members increased
the ranks of other societies already existing, or about to be
formed " such as the ' Black Knights ' under Jahn, ' The
Knights of the Queen of Prussia ', ' The Concor-dists ' under
Dr. Lang and the Deutscher Bund, founded in 1810."
The Tugendbund was revived in the Burschens-chaft, or
associations of students of the universities, where they
introduced gymnastics and martial exercises, but the
organization was broken up and its objects frustrated, after
the stabbing of Kotzebue by a student. It revived between
1830-33. It is said to have failed again.

JACOBINS

(THE CLUBS OR LODGES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION).

(Founded 1786)
The Bishop of Autun (Talleyrand), Mirabeau, and the Due
d'Orleans, Grand Master of the Grand-Orient de France
founded a Lodge in Paris in 1786 which was duly "
illuminated " by Bode and Guillaume Baron de Busche. This
was the Club Breton which afterwards became known as the
Jacobin Club, a name of Templar origin, recalling that of
Jacques de Molay.
Le Forestier in Les Illumines de Baviere et la
Franc-Magonnerie Allemande gives the substance of a book
written by Girtaner, quoting the latter as to the funds
available at that date for revolution.
" In his Nouvelles Historiques et considerations poli-tiques
sur la Revolution Frangaise (1793) the Swiss Girtaner, an
ex-freemason who had joined the ranks of the enemies of the
sect, states that, from 1786, there had existed in Paris a
Propaganda Club whose chiefs were then the Due de la
Rochefoucauld, Grand Master of the Lodge in the rue
Coq-Heron, Condorcet and Sieyes and that the aim of the
organization was to further the triumph of dogmatic Atheism
and create a great social upheaval.

" The members charged with spreading the pro-ganda of
the subversive principles of the club numbered 50,000. In
1790, it had twenty thousand livres at its disposal, but by the
end of 1791, these had increased to thirty millions. " 1
The conspiracy formed by Philippe of Orleans (Due de
Chartres, Masonic name, " Egalite ") to overthrow Louis XVI,
was directed by Sillery and Mirabeau and, of the 605 elected
members of the Tiers Etat, 477 deputies were Freemasons. 2
Revolutions cost money. " L'Or de Pitt" (Pitt's gold) had to
go through some channel that would not compromise the
English government and, in dealing with such a delicate
matter as the fostering of revolution in a foreign country, it
was good policy to organize a similar movement at home
which however should remain abortive, being led by Lord
Stanhope, Pitt's brother-in-law.
In this connection, the history and failure of Wolfe Tone's
Bantry Bay expedition is interesting.
The history of the Terror in the French Revolution of 1793

whose members the following Jacobin leaders are known to

which operated the Comite Regulateuf or Central Committee
of the combined lodges and clubs. An international
organization with foreign branches in America and Europe,
the deliberations of this group of conspirators were sent to the
Central Committee of the Grand Orient from where they were
relayed to the provinces, addressed to the various Worshipful
Masters or Presidents of the Lodges. This group according to
Barruel, was the central guiding committee of the Revolution.
The " Club Regulateur " is said to have numbered at least
500,000 brothers.

sumably, fully informed of Dupont's plan of revolution
which he himself and Mirabeau had approved at a session of
the " Amis Reunis " early in June.
While remarking that the vote for the death of the King of
France, Louis XVI, was carried by a majority of one,
Pignatel4 further states that, in consequence of certain
irregularities in the balloting, some five votes for death were
cast by unqualified persons while four others voted twice.
After the storm of revolution had subsided, the power in
France seems to have been vested in the Comite de Salut
Public, but the 300 who controlled France and of whose
power we read in Memoirs of the time 5 were the 300 masonic
leaders. That they in turn were controlled by a small clique is
obvious. Even the 300 masonic leaders of the French
Revolution of 1793 seem to have had their successors in
modern history — Rathenau mentioned them in his works.
One of the most interesting episodes of the French
Revolution was that known as the Conspiracy of Babeuf.
Babeuf formed the Society of the Pantheon which, according
to Professor Laski, 6 was operated by " a secret committee of
direction. Among them were some extraordinary men,
Darthe, Sylvain Marechal, Germain and Buonarroti, who was
to survive them all and be their historian. "
The particular brand of communism favoured by the
conspirators was based on the theory that the poor could not
help themselves or improve their position, that the rich must
be suppressed and that the ideal state

could only be reached by class war, and a dictatorship of the
proletariat led by the Babouvists. Prof. Lasky remarks that
anyone who reads the voluminous literature of this period "
with attention and compares the habits it postulates with the
operations of Bolshevism, cannot help being impressed by
the resemblance. "
The Babouvist movement though suppressed by the
Directory in 1796 survives today having successfully
penetrated an English Literary Society called the Fabians
where its predatory principles pass for Socialism.

THE UNITED IRISHMEN
(Founded 1791)
In 1791, the Society of The United Irishmen was founded
by Theobald Wolfe Tone and Napper Tandy, both of whom
were high in rank in the Masonic lodges. The organization
sought to unite Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters in order
to throw off the oppressive yoke of England or, to use the
graphic language of Tone himself, " to subvert the tyranny of
our execrable government, to break the connection with
England, the never-failing source of all our political evils,
and to assert the independence of my country — these were
my objects. To unite the whole people of Ireland. " l
The priesthood and the nobles however stood solidly
behind the English power ; but the social conditions imposed
by England on its Irish-Catholic subjects rendered that
country a fertile soil for the sowing of the Revolutionary seed.
These disabilities are described by Lecky in the following
article which appeared in Macmillan's Magazine, January,
1873.
" To sum up briefly their provisions, they (the English)
excluded the Catholics from the Parliament,
1.

from the magistracy, from the corporations, from the
university, from the bench and from the bar, from the right of
voting at parliamentary elections or at vestries of acting as
constables, as sheriffs, or as jurymen, of serving in the army
or navy, of becoming solicitors or even holding the position
of gamekeeper or watchman. They prohibited them from
becoming schoolmasters, ushers, or private tutors, or
from sending their children abroad to receive the Catholic
education they were refused at home. They offered an
annuity to every priest who would forsake his creed,
pronounced a sentence of exile against the whole hierarchy,
and restricted the right of celebrating the mass to registered
priests, whose number, according to the first intention of the
Legislature, was not to be renewed. The Catholics could not
buy land, or inherit or receive it as a gift from Protestants, or
hold life annuities, or leases for more than thirty-one years, or
any lease on such terms that the profits of the land exceeded
one-third of the rent. A Catholic, except in the linen trade,
could have no more than two apprentices. He could not have
a horse of the value of more than £5, and any Protestant on
giving him £5 might take his horse. He was compelled to pay
double to the militia. In case of war with a Catholic Power,
he was obliged to reimburse the damage done by the enemy's
privateers. To convert a Protestant to Catholicism was a
capital offence. No Catholic might marry a Protestant.
Into his own family circle the elements of dissension were
ingeniously introduced. A Catholic landowner might not
bequeath his land as he pleased. It was divided equally
among his children, unless the eldest son became a
Protestant, in which case the parent became simply a life
tenant, and lost all power either of selling or mortgaging it. If a
Catholic s wife abandoned her husband's religion, she was
immo-

diately free from his control, and the Chancellor could assign
her a certain proportion of her husband's property. If his child,
however young, professed itself a Protestant, he was taken
from his father's care, and the Chancellor could assign it a
portion of its father's property. No Catholic could be guardian
either to his own children or to those of another. "
The investigations of R. C. Clifford detailed in his book
The Application of Jacobinism to the Secret Societies of
Ireland and Great Britain led this author to the conclusion
that The United Irishmen and The Illuminati bore one another
a close resemblance and, in his Diary, Wolfe Tone himself
refers frankly to having on " several occasions pressed his
friends the Jacobins to try to extend their clubs through the
North. " 2
The history of the United Irishmen is largely the history of
Theobald Wolfe Tone.
In a note to page 77 of his Autobiography, we are given the
following information concerning the origin of The United
Irishmen. "Before Tone's arrival in Belfast a political club,
composed of Volunteers, and directed by a Secret Committee,
was in existence. Among the members of the club were
Neilson,3 Russell, the Simses, Sinclair, McTier and Macabe
after which Tone remarks " Mode of doing business by a
Secret Committee, who are not known or suspected of
co-operating, but who, in fact, direct the movements of
Belfast. "
After also drawing attention to the above, Captain Pollard
in The Secret Societies of Ireland, page 14, pro2. The Autobiography of Wolfe Tone, p. 51.

" The Jacobin ". He was the founder of The Northern Star, the first organ

ceeds to make the following observation : — « The enormous
influence of the French revolution had begun to make itself
felt in the councils of the secret associations, Jacobin
missionaries spread the doctrine of the revolution, and a new
spirit of militant republicanism was born. These emissaries
from France aimed at bringing England low, and spreading
the doctrine of world-revolution by means of an alliance
between the Catholic malcontents of the south and the
Republican Presbyterians of the north. "
Suppressed in 1794, the order had reorganized in 1795 as a
secret republican revolutionary society with subordinate
societies and committees and had absorbed that of The
Defenders.
John Keogh was the leader of the Roman Catholic branch
of the movement among the other supporters of which were
Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Robert Emmett, Thomas Addis
Emmett, Arthur O'Connor and Lord Edward Fitzgerald.
In 1795, having become seriously implicated in the
treasonable activities of the Rev. William Jackson, an
emissary of the French Government to the Irish Revolutionaries, Tone went to America where he saw the French
Minister Citizen Adet. With his approval and instructions,
Wolfe Tone sailed for France on Jan. 1, 1796 where he spent
the remainder of his days planning the downfall of England.
He held that " unless they can separate England from Ireland,
England is invulnerable. " 4
From the beginning of his French intrigues, he feared
treason to his cause and, in his diary, we find the following
entry dated March 21, 1796, quoting General Clark in a
conversation he had just had with him :

" Even in the last war when the volunteers were in force " said
the General " and a rupture between England and Ireland
seemed likely, it was proposed in the French Council to offer
assistance to Ireland, and overruled by the interest of Comte
de Vergennes, then Prime Minister, who received for that
service a considerable bribe from England, and that he
(General Clark) was informed of this by a principal agent in
paying the money. So, it seems, we had a narrow escape of
obtaining our independence fifteen years ago. It is better as it
is for then we were not united amongst ourselves, and I am
not clear that the first use we should have made of our liberty
would not have been to have begun cutting each other's
throats : so out of evil comes good. I do not like this story of
Vergennes, of the truth of which I do not doubt. How if the
devil should put it into any one's head here to serve us so this
time ! Pitt is as cunning as hell, and he has money enough,
and we have nothing but assignats ; I do not like it at all... "5
Six months after his arrival in Paris, Tone received a
commission in the French army, and with the assistance of the
Directory, General Hoche and others organized the ill fated
Bantry Bay expedition of 1796. Every effort to thwart their
plans was made by the French navy till, as Tone tells us in an
entry dated Nov. 14 to 18, " Villaret de Joyeuse, the Admiral,
is cashiered, and we have got another in his place. Joyeuse
was giving, underhand, all possible impediment to our
expedition. "
His successor, Rear-Admiral Bruix, however, seems to
have shared the indifference of his predecessor in Irish
matters, and the fact that it was " always in

their (the navy's) power to make us miscarry " is mentioned
by Tone in his diary.
On Dec. 15, the expedition finally started and on the 17th,
in a fog, the Fraternite with two of the Admirals and General
Hoche aboard got separated from the rest of the fleet leaving
Tone and General Grouchy with only about half of the
original expeditionary force at their disposal.
Tone's efforts to effect a landing at Bantry Bay were
frustrated by Grouchy's dilatory tactics and on Dec. 26 we
find the following entry in Tone's Diary : " Last night, at half
after six o'clock, in a heavy gale of wind still from the east, we
were surprised by the Admiral's frigate running under our
quarter, and hailing the Indomptable (Tone's ship) with orders
to cut our cable and put to sea instantly ; the frigate then
pursued her course, leaving us all in the utmost astonishment.
"
Did Wolfe Tone think of Vergennes then ? History fails to
tell us !
The activities of The United Irishmen ended with the
uprising of 1798 and another attempt by the French to land
troops on Irish soil. This rebellion was however also crushed,
and Wolfe Tone, who was taken prisoner and ordered to be
hanged, cut his throat in his cell.

THE ORANGE SOCIETY
(PROTESTANT

AND

MASONIC)

(Founded 1795)
The Battle of the Diamond between the Peep-o'-Day Boys
and the Defenders took place on Sept. 21, 1795.
We cannot improve on Captain Pollard's documented
information in The Secret Societies of Ireland from which we
quote :
" On the evening of the battle a number of the delegates of
the Peep-o'-Day Boys met at the house of Thomas Wilson at
Loughgall. There and then the name of the Society was
changed to The Orange Society, and a grand lodge and
subsidiary lodges initiated. The ritual was founded on
Freemasonry (1° York Rite), and the legend was that of the
Exodus of the Israelites.
" The original Peep-o'-Day Society had been confined to
the lower orders, but with the change in Orangeism the upper
classes began to take place and rank in the organization which
was secretly fostered by the Government as a counter-poise
against the seditious United Irishmen. l "
" Prom 1828, the Orange Society was under the

Grand Mastership of the Duke of Cumberland, and in 1835
there were no less than 140,000 Orangemen in England,
40,000 being in London alone. These members were not Irish
Orangemen, but purely English, and they were engaged in a
plot which recalls the best traditions of the Palais Royal and
Philippe-Egalite. The purpose of the plot was to establish the
Duke of Cumberland as King of England, on the plea that
William IV was still insane and the Princess Victoria a
woman and a minor. " 2
" The revolutionary mechanism staged by the Orangemen
was in many ways similar to that of the Orleanist party of
Philippe. Wild rumours were set about. Colonel William
Blennerhasset Fairman, Deputy Grand Secretary of the
Orange Society, was the ruling spirit of the organization, and
he conspired to such end that 381 loyal lodges were
established in Great Britain. Another thirty were in the army,
and branches were in many of the colonies.
" The conspiracy prospered from 1828 to 1835, when it
was exposed by Mr. Hume, M. P., and a Committee of
Enquiry in the Commons was granted. As the conspiracy,
however, implicated half the Tory peers, some of the Bishops
and most of the Army, everything passed off quietly;
important witnesses vanished, and the Duke of Cumberland
as Grand Master decreed the dissolution of the Orange
Society in England without recourse to violence. "
" The Volunteer movement began in 1914 in Ulster as the
direct consequence of an attempt on the part of the Liberal
Government to force the Home Rule Bill on that province.
This unfortunate measure had passed the Houses despite the
most rigid Unionist opposition,

but Ulster had no intention of surrendering to its provisions
without a struggle. The situation portended Civil War. A '
Solemn League and Covenant ', to resist it, was drawn up, and
Ulster, organizing largely through the Orange Lodges,
recruited an Ulster Volunteer Force which was completely
organized throughout the North. "
" The Orange Lodges had been reorganized in 1885, when
Gladstone introduced the threatening Home Rule Bill. Prior
to this the Order had somewhat relapsed and had been little
more than a convivial friendly society. The threat of Home
Rule brought it once more to the fore as a powerful political
organization, and the Ulster electorate, which had until then
been predominantly Liberal, became and remained solidly
Unionist. The membership of the order expanded enormously,
and the existing mechanism adapted itself to the new needs of
the old motto, ' No surrender. '
" The Orange Lodges had been legally drilling since
January 5, 1912, when application was made to the Belfast
Justices for leave to drill on behalf of Colonel R. H. Wallace,
C. B., Grand Master of the Belfast and Grand Secretary of the
Provincial Grand Lodge of Ulster ; but, the skeleton
organization had long been in existence, as was evident by the
splendidly disciplined marching of the Lodges at the great
Craigavon meeting in Sept. 1911.3
The Ulster Volunteers, under Sir Edward Carson, rejected
all suggestions for partition and proclaimed their intention of
smashing once and for all the whole Home Rule movement.
The Irish Volunteers while claiming Home Rule refused to
consent to the exclusion of Ulster on the

ground that Ulster being Ireland it should remain Ireland,
thus annulling all the efforts of Mr. Asquith, England's Prime
Minister, to effect a compromise.
Further quoting Pollard : " Affairs became more and more
chaotic and at last John Redmond, the leader of the Home
Rule party, realized in some measure what a menace the Irish
Volunteer movement was becoming.
" He decided to attempt to control them... He tried to raise
funds for the advertised purpose of purchasing arms at some
future date, but before this came about the members of the
original committee purchased a stock of serviceable weapons
with money supplied by the Irish Republican Brotherhood
and succeeded in running the cargoes in at Kilcool and Howth.
"4
Then came the declaration of war between Britain and
Germany and the part played by Ireland during the World war
is a matter of history.
Interlocked with the history of the Irish Republican
Brotherhood, The Clan-na-Gael and Sinn Fein, the activities
of this society after 1914 can be followed in the articles on
these other organizations.

THE PHILADELPHIANS
(THE OLYMPIANS)

(Founded 1798)

The Philadelphians, a Royalist Anti-Bonapartist Secret
Society, was founded on masonic lines about 1798 at
Besancon, France, by General Malet and organized by a
Freemason, Lieutenant Colonel Oudet.
Using England as a base of operations, it cooperated for a
while with the " Chouans " whose chief, Pichegru, was
eventually captured and executed by order of the Directory.
After this event, the Philadelphians adopted the name of
The Olympians. Most of them however, including Oudet,
were shot from ambush the day after the battle of Wagram,
the responsibility for their deaths being placed on Napoleon I.
In 1812 General Malet formed a conspiracy to overthrow
the Empire. Among those implicated were Generals Moreau,
Talleyrand, Trochot, the Comte de Noailles, the Comte de
Montmorency and Fouche, who was then under the cloud of
Napoleon's displeasure. General Massena, Grand Master of
the Grand Orient, who at that time was in disgrace, was to
have been offered the command of the troops. This daring
plot
395

396

almost succeeded and Fouche says that Malet carried with
him to the grave " the secret of one of the boldest conspiracies
which the Grand Epoch of the Revolution has bequeathed to

THE SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHIC RITE
(Founded 1799)
Rev. E. Cahill, S. J., in his book Freemasonry and the
Anii-Christian Movement, page 143, names The Scottish
Philosophic Rite as one of the principal divisions of
Freemasonry, and he writes :
" The Scottish Philosophic Rite is practised by the Masons
subject to the Lodge Alpina in Switzerland. This latter Grand
Lodge, which is among those formally recognized by the
Grand Lodges of the British Isles, is of special importance, as
it is not unfrequently utilised as a kind of liaison body by the
different rites and lodges of the several jurisdictions all over
the world in their negotiations with each other. "

MODERN KNIGHTS TEMPLAR ENGLAND
(Founded 1804)
In an address by Col. W. J. B. Macleod Moore, of the
Grand Cross of the Temple Royal Arch, Grand Prior of the
Dominion of Canada, printed in The Rosi-crucian and
Masonic Record (page 165), we obtain the following salient
points of English Templar history :
" In 1791, we find the Templar Rite styled ' Grand Elect
Knights Templar Kadosh, of St. John of Jerusalem, Palestine,
Rhodes, and Malta', thus combining the modern and more
ancient titles... In 1848 after the Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rite of 33° had been established in England, the
Templar body resigned control over the Rose Croix and
Kadosh, which had been incorporated into the Ancient and
Accepted Rite as the 18th and 30th degrees. It was therefore
necessary to suppress the old ceremonies and confine
themselves to the Templar alone and to change the name into
the degree of ' Masonic Knights Templar '. This title was not
used in England before 1851, although the term Masonic
appears in the warrants of Admiral Dunkerley

between 1791 1 and 1796... Until 1853 the Order of the
Temple and Malta remained combined.
" In 1863 the Grand Conclave again formally revived the
Maltese Order, with a considerable ritual, but as a separate
degree instead of combined with the Templars as it had been
before 1853. "
The following, borrowed from The History of Freemasonry
and Concordant Orders, a work by Stillson and Hughan,
reputed authorities on Masonic matters, gives us the history of
Modern English Templarism.
" In 1867-68 a proposal was promulgated to unite the
branches of the Order in England, Ireland and Scotland, under
one head ; andH.-. R.\ II.-. the Prince of Wales, who had been
initiated into Masonry and the Templar degree in Sweden,
consented, in 1869, to assume the Grand Mastership of the
Templars of the United Kingdom. On the 7th April, 1873,
II.-. R.\ H.\
was installed Grand Master... This assumption by II.-. R.-. II.-.
the Prince of Wales, to use the words of the Arch-Chancellor
of the Order, Sir Patrick Col-quhoun, ' effected a perfect
reformation of the Order, and procured for it a status it had
hitherto not enjoyed, even under the Duke of Kent, who must
be practically regarded as its founder, with the additional
advantage of H.\ R.\ II.-. being at once head of the Craft and
Temple ; indeed, it may be said that as the Order was
reformed in 1804-7 by the Duke of Kent, so it was again
refounded under his grandson, the Prince of Wales, in 1873 '.
At this date the Order assumed the name of United Religious
and Military Order of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem,
Palestine, Rhodes and Malta. "
1. The close connection between Grand Lodge and English Templarism,
prior to 1791, is established in an article by T. B. Whytehead, in The
Rosicrucian and Masonic Record, pp. 317 and 325.

Macleod Moore informs us that in 1813 the Craft degrees,
including the.Royal Arch,'were alone recognized as pure and
ancient Freemasonry and that the possession of the Royal
Arch degree in modern times has been, and is now,
considered quite sufficient to preserve the link between the
Temple Order and Freemasonry.

MODERN KNIGHTS TEMPLAR FRANCE
(Founded 1804)
Heckethorn in his well-known book Secret Societies of all
Ages and Countries gives the following graphic description
of the foundation of this order.
" We read that several lords of the Court of Louis XIV,
including the Duke de Gramont, the Marquis of Biran, and
Count Tallard, formed a secret society, whose object was
pleasure. The society increased. Louis XIV, having been
made acquainted with its statutes, banished the members of
the Order, whose denomination was, ' A slight Resurrection
of the Templars. '
" In 1705, Philippe, Duke of Orleans, l collected the
remaining members of the society that had renounced its first
scope to cultivate politics. A Jesuit father, Bonanni, a learned
rogue, fabricated the famous list of supposititious Grand
Masters of the Temple since Molay, beginning with his
immediate successor, Larmenius. No imposture was ever
sustained with greater sagacity. The document offered all the
requisite characteristics of authenticity, and was calculated to
deceive the most

experienced palaeologist. Its object was to connect the new
institution with the ancient Templars. To render the deception
more perfect, the volume containing the false list was filled
with minutes of deliberations at fictitious meetings under
false dates. Two members were even sent to Lisbon, to obtain
if possible a document of legitimacy from the ' Knights of
Christ ', an Order supposed to have been founded on the ruins
of the Order of the Temple. But the deputies were unmasked
and very badly received : one had to take refuge in England,
the other was transported to Africa, where he died.
" But the society was not discouraged; it grew, and was
probably the same that concealed itself before the outbreak of
the revolution under the vulgar name of the Society of the
Bull's Head and whose members were dispersed in 1792. At
that period the Duke of Cosse-Brissac was Grand Master.
When on his way to Versailles with other prisoners, there to
undergo their trial, he was massacred, and Ledru, his
physician, obtained possession of the charter of Larmenius
and the MS. statutes of 1705. These documents suggested to
him the idea of reviving the order ; Fabre-Palaprat, a
Freemason, was chosen grand master. Every effort was made
to create a belief in the genuineness of the Order. The brothers
Fabre, Arnal, and Leblond hunted up relics. The shops of
antiquaries supplied the sword, mitre, and helmet of Molay,
and the faithful were shown his bones, withdrawn from the
funeral pyre on which he has been burned. " 2
This presumably is the particular Templar sect that
furnished Isaac Long with all the Templar

bric-a-brac that found its way to Charleston in 1804 " As in
the Middle Ages, the society exacted that aspirants should be
of noble birth ; such as were not were ennobled by it.
Fourteen honest citizens of Troyes on one occasion received
patents of nobility and convincing coats of arms. "
The order founded its first Lodge on Dec. 23, 1805,
deriving from the Grand Orient of France.
From 1805 to 1815, the brother Francisco Alvaro da Silva,
Knight of the Order of Christ, secret agent in Paris of John VI
of Portugal, was a member of the order. He knew its secret
history from its organizers, and in 1812 became its Chief
Secretary.
In 1814, Fabre-Palaprat found a Greek manuscript of the
15th century, containing a chapter of St. John the Evangelist
which conflicted on many points with the Gospel inserted in
the canons of the Roman Church and preceded by a sort of
introduction and commentary entitled Leviticon. He forthwith
determined to appropriate this doctrine to his order, which
was thus transformed from a perfectly orthodox association
into a schismatic sect. The author of this work was a monk at
Athens called Nicephorus. He was a member of the Sufi sect,
one which professes the doctrines of the Ancient Lodge of
Cairo.
" Those knights that adopted its doctrines made them the
basis of a new liturgy, which they rendered public in 1833 in a
kind of Johannite church. "
The Order of the Temple of Paris described by Heckethorn,
as stated above, gives a list of the names of the successors of
Jacques de Molay as follows. Other Templars, who do not
admit the legality of the Grand Mastership of Larmenius, give
different lists of Grand Masters :

RITE OF MIZRAIM
(Founded 1805)

This rite had 90 degrees. It was founded in 1805 at Milan
by Le Changeur, Gavel, Marc Bedarride and Joly, and was
introduced into France in 1816.
Its trials of initiation were long and difficult, and founded
on what is recorded of the Egyptian and Eleusinian mysteries.
Heckethorn states that this rite is essentially autocratic
there being no obligation on the Grand Master to account for
his actions.
In the Rosicrucian for January 1871 we read the following
notice (page 136).
" We have great pleasure in announcing that this
philosophic Masonic Rite (Ancient and Primitive Rite of
Mizraim) has been recently established in England under
authority derived from the Grand Council of Rites for France,
and that the Conservators General held a meeting at
Freemasons Tavern, on Wednesday, the 28th December. The
principal chairs were filled by 111. Bros. Wentworth Little
90° ; the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Limerick 90°; and S. Rosenthal
90°; by whom the ' Bective ' Sanctuary of Levites — the 33rd
of the Rite — was duly opened...
407

408

It was then anounced that the following brethren had
accepted office in the Rite : The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Bective,
Sovereign Grand Master, etc., etc. "
The Rite of Mizraim was amalgamated with that of
Memphis in 1775, when John Yarker, as stated by Freke
Gould 1 " sanctioned the communication of the degrees of
Mizraim to members of the Rite of Memphis, the former
having no separate governing body in this country "
(England).
" According to an official statement, repeated in every
number of the Kneph : " France (having) abandoned the Rite,
and the 111. Gd. Hierophant, J. E. Marconis, 33°, 97°, having
died in 1868, Egypt took full possession. The Craft Gd.
Lodge, our Antient and Primitive Rite, and the Antient and
Accepted Rite, executed a tripartite Treaty to render mutual
aid, and restored the Sov. Gd. Mystic Temple — Imp.
Council Cen., 96°, presided over by a Gd. Hierophant, 97°, in
1775. "
Essentially Jewish, the historical activities of this order to
date are interesting.
Some years ago, a document to which the reader must be
referred, The Protocols of the Wise Men or Elders of Zion 2,
was brought to light. Abstracted from a Jewish Lodge of
Mizraim in Paris, in 1884, by Joseph Schorst, later murdered
in Egypt, it embodied the programme of esoteric Judaism.
Schorst was the son of a man who, in 1881, had been
sentenced in London to ten years penal servitude for
counterfeiting.
Before studying these Protocols however, the reader
should be made acquainted with a few facts.
This document was first published in 1905 at Tsarskoe

Selo (Russia), embodied in a book called The Great Within
the Small written by Sergius A. Nilus.
In January 1917, a second edition, revised and documented,
was ready, but before it could be put on the market for
distribution and sale, the revolution had taken place (March
1917), and the Provisional Government had been replaced by
that of Kerensky who himself gave the order to have the
whole edition of S. A. Nilus's book destroyed. It was burnt.
A few copies however had been distributed, one of them
found its way to England, one to Germany and one again to
the United States of America in 1919. In each of these three
countries, a few people determined to make a close study of
the document with the result that it was soon published
everywhere.
In England, it was and still is published by an organization
called " The Britons ".
In Germany, a remarkable work was done by Gottfried
zum Beck.
In France, it was published by Mgr. Jouin of the Revue
Internationale des Societes Secretes and by the fearless M.
Urbain Gohier of Vieille France.
In the United States, two anonymous editions were
published, one by Small Maynard of Boston, and the other,
later, by the Beckwith Company.
Then editions appeared in Italian, Russian, Arabic and
even Japanese.
No sooner had the document been made public than loud
protests were heard coming from all sections of dispersed
Israel. Writers and lecturers were recruited to deny the
assertion and shatter the growing belief of a Jewish
conspiracy for the political, economic and legislative
dominion of the world.
The method of intimidation used to suppress discussion of
The Protocols has always been the same. It

410

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

consists in suggesting that the person guilty of interest in the
subject is crazy or becoming so. As the average mortal prefers
to be thought sane by his fellow men, the trick generally
works.
A short review of the affray must be made. First and
foremost came a strong denial made by a Jew, Lucien Wolf,
who wrote the pamphlet : The Jewish Bogey and the Forged
Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, (1920). Israel
Zangwill, another Jew, also wrote against the veracity of the
Protocols. Then, in America, followed articles by William
Hard, in the Metropolitan, ridiculing belief in the document.
More serious was the painstaking campaign undertaken
against the publication of the Protocols by the chiefs of the U.
S. Kahal or Kehillah, who intimidated the editor, George H.
Putnam, and. forced him to stop the publication of the book by
threats to call his loans and thus ruin him financially. The
Beckwith Co. was eventually induced by the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League to enclose in every copy of the
edition they published a small pamphlet containing the denial
of the contents of the Protocols.
Among the Gentiles found ready to deny the truth of the
Protocols was a certain du Chayla, also a Mrs. Hurl-but and
the notorious Princess Catherine Radziwill who had
previously reached the pinnacle of self-advertisement by
having had herself sentenced to a term of imprisonment in
South Africa for forgery in 1902. It seemed as if all the denials
against the Jewish authorship of the Protocols had been made,
when finally in 1921 the London Times made the sensational
discovery through one of its correspondents in Constantinople,
a Mr. X. — of a French book which they called the Dialogues
of Geneva, published anonymously at Brussels in 1865. It was
this book, the Times affirmed, which

RITE

OF M1ZRAIM

411

had been plagiarized by the author of the Protocols.
The publication of this discovery by the Times seemed to
have closed all further discussion tending to prove the Jewish
authenticity of the Protocols and very little has been heard
since on the subject.
Yet, to use the words of the Zionist, Max Nordau, during
his violent quarrel with another Zionist, Asher Ginzberg :
Audealur et altera pars. It is this other side of the story which
the reader is now asked to hear.
The book The Times called The Geneva Dialogues bears in
reality the following title : Dialogues aux Enfers entre
Machiavelli et Montesquieu. It had been published
anonymously in Brussels in 1864. The introduction ends thus :
" Geneva, October 13, 1865 ".
It was soon discovered by the police of Napoleon III that
the author of the book was a certain lawyer, Maurice Joly,
who was arrested, tried, and sentenced to two years'
imprisonment (April 1865), as it was averred that he had
written his book as an attack against the government of
Napoleon III to which he had lent all the Machiavelian plans
revealed in the Dialogues.
A short sketch of the author's life is necessary in order to
understand the spirit of his book.
Maurice Joly (1831-1878), was born at Lons-le-Saul-nier.
His mother, nee Florentine Corbara Courtois, was a Corsican
of Italian origin and a Roman Catholic. Her father, Laurent
Courtois, had been paymaster-general of Corsica. He had an
inveterate hatred of Napoleon I.
Joly's father was Philipe Lambert Joly, born at Dieppe,
Normandy. He had a comfortable fortune and had been
attorney general for the department of Jura for a period of 10
years under Louis Philippe. Maurice Joly
was educated at Dijon and began his law studies there, but
in 1849 he left for Paris.

412

OCCULT THEOCRASY

There, thanks to his maternal grandfather's masonic
associations, he secured, just before the Coup d'Etat in 1851,
a post in the Ministry of the Interior under M. Chevreau. In
1860 only, he terminated his law studies, — he wrote several
articles, showed a certain amount of talent and ended by
founding a paper called Le Palais for lawyers and attorneys.
The principal stockholders were Jules Favre, Desmaret,
Leblond, Adolphe Cremieux, Arago, and Berryer.
Joly was a Socialist. He wrote of himself: " Socialism
seems to me one of the forms of a new life for the peoples
emancipated from the traditions of the Old World. I accept a
great many of the solutions offered by Socialism but I reject
Communism either as a social factor or as a political
institution. Communism is but a school of Socialism. In
politics I understand extreme means to gain one's ends — in
that, at least, I am a Jacobin. "
Friend of Adolphe Cremieux, he shared in his hatred of
Napoleon III. He hated absolutism as much as he hated
Communism and as, under the influence of his Prime
Minister Rouher, the French Emperor led a policy of reaction,
Maurice Joly qualified it as Machia-velian and depicted it as
such in his pamphlet.
In one of his books he wrote of it :
" Machiavelli represents the policy of Might compared to
Montesquieu's, which represents the policy of Right —
Machiavelli will be Napoleon III who will himself depict his
abominable policy ". (From Maurice Joly — Son passe, son
programme — by himself, 1870).
And here comes the important point which the Times
omitted to put before its readers when it made the sensational
discovery about the Dialogues of Geneva in 1921!
Maurice Joly, who hated Communism and, in 1864,
ascribed the Machiavelian policy of Might over Right

RITE

OF MIZRAIM

413

to the Imperialism of Napoleon III, was evidently ignorant of
the fact that he himself was no innovator, for, long before he
ever entered the journalistic or political world, the very theory
which he had tried to expose and refute had been the guiding
principle of a group of ardent revolutionists, promoters of
Communism, and worthy followers of Illuminatis and
Babouvists, the group of Karl Marx, Jacoby, etc. the agitators
of the 1848 revolution.
Long before Maurice Joly's book Dialogues aux Enfers
entre Machiavelli et Montesquieu had made its appearance,
another book bearing much the same title had been published
in Berlin in 1850. It was called
Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Rousseau
by Jacob Venedy and was published by Franz Dun-nicker,
Berlin. 3
Jacob Venedy, the author, was a Jew, born in Cologne,
May 1805, died February 1871. Owing to his revolutionary
activities, he was expelled from Germany and sought refuge
in France. "While living in Paris, in 1835, he edited a paper of
subversive character called he Pro-scrit which caused the
police to send him away from Paris. He then lived at Le Havre.
Later, due to the intercession of Arago and Mignet, friends of
Adolphe Cremieux, he was once more allowed to return to
Paris. Meanwhile, he had published a book, Romanisme,
Christianisme et Germanisme, which had won for him the
praise of the French Academy. Venedy was a close friend and
associate of Karl Marx. He had spent the years 1843-44 in
England which at that time was the refuge and abode of all the
master minds of the 1848 revolution. In 1847 Venedy was in
Brussels with Karl

Marx who had founded there the secret organization called "
The Communist League of Workers ", which was eventually
brought out into the open under the name of " The
International Society of Democracy " (Societe Internationale
de la Democratic).
In 1848, after the February Revolution, Venedy returned to
Germany, still in the company of Karl Marx. He soon
afterwards became one of the chiefs of the revolutionary
Committee of Fifty, organized at Frankfort-on-Main in March
1848. Venedy was sent as " Commissar " into the Oberland to
stand against Ecker. In Hesse-Homburg he was elected a
member of the Left and took his place in the Committee of
Fifty. It was at this time that in Berlin he published his book
Machiavelli, Montesquieu and Rousseau, upholding the ideas
of Machiavelli and Rousseau for the slavery and
demoralization of the people.
When order was once more re-established in Germany,
Venedy was expelled from Berlin and Breslau.
He was an active member of the Masonic Order Bauhlitte
which was affiliated to the Carbonari. (See Die Bauhlutte for
Feb. 25, 1871).
It is to be regretted that the Times, which had started an
investigation to trace the authorship of The Protocols of the
Wise Men of Zion, and lift it off the shoulders of Jewry upon
which it rested, should have missed looking into the literary
and revolutionary activities of Jacob Venedy.
Following the apparent contradiction between Jacob
Venedy and Maurice Joly, one showing the Machiavelli and
Rousseau policy as that of triumphant Communism, whilst
the other makes it the policy of Reaction and Imperialism, one
is apt to overlook the link between the two. The student of the
1830-1848 period of history is here confronted by a
remarkable fact.

RITE OF MIZRAIM

415

Fould, the Rothschilds of Paris, London and Vienna,
Montefiore, Disraeli, the Goldsmids, were not less Jews than
Karl Marx, Moses Hess, Jacoby, Lassalle, Venedy, Riesser.
The Liberal Conservatism of Disraeli, the reactionary
Imperialism of Fould and the revolutionary Communism of
Karl Marx all point towards the same aim, namely, the
establishment of Jewish power, whether under a
Constitutional Monarchy, an Empire, or a Republic. And
although their respective activities seem to stand so far apart,
yet they are all linked, all tending towards the same end. One
of the most striking instances is the case of Adolphe Cremieux
who played a prominent part in the period we are now
concerned with, and who was connected with all parties and
actually helped form the centre which united them all, viz. The
ALLIANCE ISRAELITE UNIVERSELLE, which was, in fact, the
central Kahal for Universal Jewry.
The life of Adolphe Cremieux and the activities of his
Jewish contemporaries, belonging to widely divergent social
spheres, illustrate forcibly the concerted plan of Judaism to
reach its secret Messianic hope of world domination.
Until about 1848, it seemed somewhat difficult to show
conclusively the link between Judaism and Illuminism,
Communism and Capitalism, but a close study of the life of
Adolphe Cremieux, and that of his confidential agent, Leon
Gambetta, throws full light on the subject.
Whereas in Gentile life, there is an unbridgeable abyss
between Conservatism and Anarchy, Religion and Atheism,
there is no such chasm in the Jewish mentality. There, all
currents, no matter in what direction they may seem to flow,
are finally united and channelled in one unique direction.
If it has been somewhat difficult for historians of

416

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the French Revolution to see the close link between Judaism and
Illuminism, we repeat that no such difficulty exists for the student
of the 1848 revolutionary period, after he has followed the life of
Adolphe Cre-mieux and the activities of his Jewish contemporaries.
The main difference is that the term " Illuminism " used in the 18th
century is replaced by the wide term Freemasonry which embraces
all the existent secret societies.
Adolphe Isaac Cremieux (1796-1880) came from a Jewish family
of the South of France, that had members in Aix, Nimes and
Marseilles. 4
In his youth, Cremieux was an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon
I ; yet in 1831, he pronounces the funeral eulogy of the ill famed
revolutionist of 1789, the Abbe Gregoire. He chose law as his
profession and was admitted to the Bar at Nimes in 1817.
Briefly, Cremieux's life may be viewed from three sides : 1st, his
racial Jewish activities, 2nd, his Masonic activities, 3rd, his
political influence.
Cremieux's racial Jewish activities are exemplified by the part he
took in the Damascus Affair with Moses Montefiore, a Jew of
England, when Jewry successfully but unconvincingly silenced the
accusation of ritual murder committed upon the Catholic priest,
Father Thomas, at Damascus, in 1840. He had a prominent share in
the foundation and development of the Alliance Israelite
Universelle. Officially founded in 1860, this international union of
disseminated Jewry had, as we know, existed for centuries, but
after the Damascus

affair, the Jewish leaders knew that they had attained
sufficient power to feel enabled to show to the whole world
that although the civil rights they enjoyed had been granted
them by different countries, the real allegiance of each and
every one of them was due to their Jewish nationality.
The Masonic activities of Adolphe Cremieux were many
and powerful. His connection with Louis Bonaparte and his
brother, who both were affiliated to the Carbonari, would
suggest that he was also connected with this secret society.
But it is a fact that Cremieux belonged to the Lodge of
Mizraim, the Scottish Rite, and also the Grand Orient. He was
in the Supreme Council of the Order of Mizraim and, at the
death of Viennet, in whose person the Grand Orient and the
Scottish Rite had been united, Cremieux succeeded him as
Grand Master.
The political activities of Cremieux are also manifold and
varied. In his youth, he had been an admirer of Napoleon I and
later became an intimate friend as well as the legal adviser of
the Bonaparte family and joined their party which was
undermining the government of Louis Philippe, son of
Philippe " Egalite "
In 1848, he was one of the most ardent supporters of Louis
Napoleon and took an active part in the overthrow of Louis
Philippe. He had been one of the foremost speakers in the
association known as the Campagne des Banquets which had
done so much to promote the Revolution of Feb. 1848.
He became a member of the provisional government and
was appointed Minister of Justice. He strongly advocated the
candidature of his friend, Louis Napoleon, for the post of
President of the French Republic. Cremieux had had hopes of
being made Chief Executive under Louis Napoleon and thus
play in France the

418

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

same role which Disraeli played in England, that is ruling the
country from behind the scenes. Both Disraeli and Cremieux
had the same financial backing, namely the wealth of the
Rothschilds and Montefiores who, in London, were friends of
Disraeli and, in Paris, friends of Cremieux. Cremieux was
therefore keenly disappointed when General Cavaignac was
appointed Prime Minister in the Republican Government of
Louis Napoleon, and as a revenge, he directed his activities
against the Prince President, his former friend. He became so
hostile to him, that in 1851, after the Coup d'Etat of December
2, by which Louis Napoleon recreated the Empire and
assumed the title of Napoleon III, Cremieux was imprisoned
at Vincennes and Mazas. After his release, he made himself
the champion and defender of the Communist associates of
Karl Marx, the revolutionaries Louis Blanc, Ledru Rollin,
Pierre Leroux and others.
His untiring efforts were directed against the Empire in
general and Napoleon III in particular, and he consorted with
all the Emperor's enemies, among them, Maurice Joly, the
author of the Dialogue between Machia-velli and
Montesquieu. After the overthrow of Napoleon III and the
defeat of France at the hands of Germany in 1871, and the
establishment of the Republic, Cremieux once more took an
open part in the political affairs of the country.
He pushed to the front his former secretary Gam-betta and
effectively directed him in his shady negotiations with
Bismarck, the latter himself being guided by the Jew
Bamberger (1852-1899), a former revolutionist of 1848, but
who, having found refuge in France, had been for many years
manager in Paris of the Jewish Bank Bischoffsheim and
Goldschmidt. He was one of Cremieux's friends, and the war
could not affect

the ties linking the Jews united in the Alliance Israelite
Universelle.
From 1871 until his death, it can be safely asserted that
Cremieux as President of the Alliance Israelite Universelle
and Grand Master of the Scottish Rile. exercised a tremendous
influence upon the anti-religious campaign which followed
the Franco-Prussian War. In this as in all his lifelong activities,
Cremieux was only obeying the teachings of the Talmud and
trying to destroy every religion but that contained in Judaism.
His favourite theme was that there should be only one cult —
and that cult should be Jewish. At a general assembly of the
Alliance Israelite Universelle, on May 31 1864, Cremieux
had said : " The Alliance is not limited to our cult, it voices its
appeal to all cults and wants to penetrate in all the religions as
it has penetrated into all countries. Let us endeavour boldly to
bring about the union of all cults under one flag of Union and
Progress. Such is the slogan of humanity. "5

One cult, one flag ! Are the Protocols of the Wise Men of
Zion or the speeches of Machiavelli in Joly's book anything
but a lengthy exposition of the ideas briefly expressed by
Cremieux ? His activities are one of the clearest examples of
Jewish internationalism and Jewish efforts for the realization
of the Messianic ideal.
The Alliance Israelite Universelle issued from the Rite of
Mizraim plus Universal Freemasonry, subsidized by
International Finance, would spell the doom of Christian
civilization, the destruction of nationalism, the death of
nations upon whose ruin has been erected
5. " Union and Progress " was the name given to several revolutionary
associations and also to several Masonic Lodges.

a new Temple of Solomon, containing the treasures and
material wealth of the whole world, and over which is placed
the six pointed star of ZIONISM. 6
Leon Gambetta (1838-1882) an Italian Jew, obtained
French naturalization on Oct. 29, 1859, and in 1862 became
the secretary of Cremieux. He was Depute in 1869, Dictator
of National Defence, head of the War Office and Minister of
the Interior after the Commune of 1870 and Dictator again
after the Coup d'Etat of the President of the Republic Marshal
MacMahon in 1877.
The following quotation from a letter which he wrote to his
father on June 22, 1863 is interesting.
" My chief, Maitre Cremieux, treats me as if I were his
adopted son, and if within three years time he is elected a
deputy (which is quite possible) my career will be settled
once and for all. I must devote myself to law and politics, and
then I may hope to triumph over all obstacles and finally to
attain great honours. "7
6. The means for the attainment of Cremieux's ambition are
set forth in a book entitled Paris, Capitate des Religions, by
Jean Izoulet.

THE

SOCIETY

(ROMAN CATHOLIC)

(Founded 1805)

This society appeared about 1805-1807.
We are again indebted to Captain Pollard for a sketch of its
history : " After the suppression of the United Irishmen the
society, as such, disappeared, but within a year or two we find
a renaissance of the old agrarian Catholic secret societies
which had been absorbed into the Defenders and thence into
the United Irishmen. The provisions of the Insurrection Act
which forbade the possession of arms and enforced a curfew
at nightfall were in operation until 1805, when with its relaxation appears the Ribbon Society... In different counties local
organizations of Ribbon men called themselves by different
titles, such as the Threshers, the Carders, the Molly Maguires,
Rockites, Caravats, Shanavests, Pauddeen Gar's men and the
like. " l
The Ribbon Society " continued the system of organization
used by the United Irishmen. A lodge was limited to forty
members and they met as a rule in the fields by night,
armed sentinels being posted to

guard the spot. The lodge was under a Master or Body Master,
who controlled three committee-men, each of whom was
responsible for twelve members of the lodge. The Masters
were represented on divisional committees allocated on the
basis of four or more divisions to a geographical county. The
divisional committees were controlled by Parish Masters,
who in turn were represented on the County Council, which
contributed two delegates to the National Board. 2
" As Whiteboys they certainly were at political and
practical war with the Orangemen, and throughout their
activities appear to have been criminal and antisocial ; outrage,
terrorism and murder being their only methods of political
conversion. " 3

RITE (ANCIENT AND

(Founded 1808)
The following article is quoted in part from an article specifically
written by Josiah H. Drummond 33° in The History Of Freemasonry
and Concordant Orders by Stillson and Hughan : l
" In 1806 Joseph Cerneau appeared in New York; he had been a
member of Masonic bodies in the West Indies ; he had a patent from
Mathieu Dupotet certifying that he had received the degrees of the
Scottish Rite of Heredom, and authorizing him to confer the degrees
up to the Twenty-fourth and organize bodies in the northern part of
Cuba, and to confer the Twenty-fifth on one person in each year, the
Twenty-fifth being then the highest degree of the Rite and the
highest Cerneau had received, according to his patent. Cerneau had
his patent from Dupotet, who had his from Germain Hacquet, who
had his from Du Plessis, who had his from Prevost in 1790, who had
his from Francken. "2

In 1808 he called a grand consistory of the Rite of
Heredom having jurisdiction over 25 degrees.
" But already a controversy had arisen with parties acting
under, or deriving their powers from, the Supreme Council at
Charleston. We may well believe that Cerneau and his
associates soon recognized the impossibility of maintaining
successfully a rite of twenty-five degrees against one of
thirty-three degrees... The Thirty-third degree as now existing
originated at Charleston in 1801 ; and no evidence has been
found that Cerneau ever received it. "
Cerneau seems however to have overlooked the obvious
expedient of creating a 34th degree !
" The Charleston body did not recognize the Cerneau
Bodies even by silent acquiescence ; after investigation by a
special Deputy, it declared, early in 1814, Cerneau to be an
impostor, and his organizations illegal and clearly clandestine.
"
" Bitter controversies followed. " Lodges which soon died
were opened at Charleston. Others at New Orleans eked out a
precarious existence under James Foulhouze. " Foulhouze
had received the Thirty-third degree from the Grand Orient of
France, which expelled him, Feb. 4, 1859, for a scurrilous
publication which he issued in answer to one of its decrees.
This Supreme Council became dormant; but, in 1867, it was
revived with Eugene Chassaignac at its head ; in 1868 it was
recognized by the Grand Orient of France, and unless it has
recently gone out of existence, the Grand-Orient to-day
recognizes a so-called Supreme Council in New Orleans as a
lawful body, and its members as possessing the Thirty-third
degree ! "
In 1826 the Morgan murder occurred and Cerneau left for
France. De Witt Clinton, Governor of New York, had been
Deputy Grand Commander of the Sove-

reign Consistory from 1811 to 1823 when he was elected
Grand Commander.
A number of sporadic revivals of this rite occurred during
the ensuing 40 years.
They were known as —
The Hicks Rite, founded in 1832 by Comte de St. Laurent.
The First Atwood Body, founded about 1837 by Henry C.
Atwood.
The Cross Body, founded about 1851 by Jeremy L. Cross.
The Second Atwood Body, founded about 1853.
It was not till 1867 that peace was established between the
three de facto Supreme Councils in the northern part of the
United States. On that date they united and Josiah H.
Drummond was elected Grand Commander.
After five years of peace, however, Henry J. Seymour, who
had been expelled by the council of which he was a member,
organized what he called a Supreme Council of which he was
made Grand Commander, " but, on a visit to Europe in 1862,
in his eagerness to obtain recognition, he unwittingly held
Masonic communication with the Grand Orient of France,
which created such a storm that he resigned his office, and
since but little has been heard of that Supreme Council,
although it probably still exists. "
" In 1881, Hopkins Thompson, an Emeritus member of the
Supreme Council, assisted by a few Honorary members and
by a Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret, who is believed by
many to have been the mainspring of the movement, all of
whom had taken the oath of fealty to the Supreme Council,
formed an association, which they are pleased to call the
Cerneau Supreme Council ' revived '. "

" This body claims jurisdiction over the South, the claim to
which was abandoned, before 1866, by unanimous vote,
including Thompson's ! It denies the legality of the Southern
Supreme Council, from which alone the Thirty-third degree
came, and which Thompson by his vote recognized and
whose recognition and fraternal support, he, with his
associates, sought to obtain. "3
The visit to Europe of Henry J. Seymour referred to in the
above quotation had serious consequences. We find that
Seymour at that time was in communication with John Yarker
with whom he collaborated in founding the Ancient and
Primitive Rite, the ramifications of which reach to all the
branches of occult illuminism such as Societas Rosicruciana
in Anglia, Memphis and Mizraim, Ancient Order of Oriental
Templars, etc.

CARBONARISM (THE
ALTA VENDITA)
(HAUTE

VENTE D'lTALIE)

(Alta Vendita [Lodge] Founded 1809)
The Carbonari had existed internationally, it is said, under
different names since the days of Francis I, King of France,
but not till the year 1815 did we begin to hear of its individual
historical achievements.
The following is a translation of one of the secret official
documents published in Italy by the highest authority of the
order, for the guidance of the active head-centres of Masonry
in 1818, under the title of : Permanent Instructions, or
Practical Code of Rules; Guide for the Heads of the Highest
Grades of Masonry1. The original Italian document was given
to Nubio, one of the Supreme Vendita (Alta Vendita) in 1824,
when he was sent to Rome to carry it into effect, and it was to
this instruction that he referred when he wrote from Forli to
Signor Volpi : " As I have written to you before, I am
appointed to demoralise the education of the youth of the
Church". When these documents

Brothers, p. 62, published 1878.
427

428

OCCULT THEOCRASY

were lost, the Freemasons offered fabulous sums for their
recovery. These secret Instructions, intended only for a
chosen few Masons of heavy calibre, were written three years
after what was called the " Restoration " of 1815, which was
brought about by a number of veteran Freemasons, all born in
the past century, who had preceded, made, planned, and
passed through the French Revolution of 1789. They were
rife with the republican notions of France and Italy. They had
survived their works, and had been in a great measure
defeated, or at least modified, by Napoleon, in whose hands
they were like a boat in the hands of new pilots, and, stunned
by the many changes, were motionless for a time. In 1815,
brought, as it were, in presence of a new world, they took
breath and courage, and gathering up the broken threads of
the tangled skein, determined to spend the rest of their lives in
restoring, if possible, the web commenced in 1789 and 1783.
The principal author was supposed to be a man of the name of
Filippo Buonarotti, one of the great correspondents of Nubio.
From his biography, given in the eighth volume of the Mondo
Segreto di Castro, he would appear to have been an apt pupil
and follower of Nubio's principle, Ama nesciri et pro nihilo
computari. He was born at Pisa in 1761, was a friend of
Robespierre, and an enemy of Napoleon, against whom he
always conspired. He was a centre in Paris for both French
and Italian Carbonari. He had been one of the principals in
1821,2 and in 1830 founded the sect of the Apofe-simeni. In a
published record, entitled Bologna of the New Secret Society,
1835, we find the name of a young man, Giuseppe Petroni,
afterwards a celebrated Maz-zinian,
and now (1878)
Grand Master Aggunto of

Roman Masonry of the Via della Valle, who was likewise one
of this noble band. My readers may now thoroughly
understand the character of the authors of this secret and
curious document of the Instructions. It is a resume and
summary, expressed in the clearest terms, of the aim of
Freemasonry and the means by which it is attained ;
Freemasonry antecedent to the French Revolution;
Freemasonry during the French Revolution ; Freemasonry
revived after the Restoration. Freemasonry, to-day, is one and
the same, using the same means to work out the same end and
object.
" So these old conspirators of the past century wakened up
in 1815 from their long sleep more energetic than ever, and as
a first step towards reviving their secret society work, wrote
the following Permanent Instructions, as a guide for the
Higher initiated who were chosen to command the whole
Masonic movement, especially in Italy : —
" Now that we are constituted in an active body, and that
our Order begins to reign as well in places most remote as in
those that are nearest ov r centre, one great thought arises, a
thought that has always greatly pre-occupied the men who
aspire to the universal regeneration of the world, that thought
is, the Liberation of Italy, for from Italy shall one day issue
the freedom of the entire world — a Republic of Fraternity,
Harmony, and Humanity. This great idea is not yet comprehended by our brothers of France. They believe that
revolutionary Italy can only plot in the shade, and accomplish
the stabbing of a few spies, cr traitors, meantime bearing
patiently the yoke of facts accomplished elsewhere, for Italy,
but without Italy. This error has been very fatal to us. It is
useless to combat it with words which would only propagate
more. It is necessary to annihilate it with facts. And in the
midst

430

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

of anxieties, which agitate the most vigorous spirits of'our
society, one there is that can never be forgotten. The Papacy
ever exercises a decisive influence over the lot of Italy. With
the arm, the voice, the pen, of its innumerable bishops, monks,
nuns, and faithful of all latitudes, the Pope finds everywhere
persons enthusiastically prepared for sacrifice, and even for
martyrdom, friends who would die for him, or sacrifice all for
his love. It is a mighty lever, the full power of which few
Popes understood, and which has as yet been used but
partially. The question of to-day is not the reconstruction of a
momentarily weakened power.
" Our final aim is that of Voltaire and of the French
Revolution, — the complete annihilation of Catholicism, and
ultimately of Christianity. Were Christianity to survive, even
upon the ruins of Rome, it would, a little later on, revive and
live. We must now consider how to reach our end, with
certainty, not cheating ourselves with delusions, which would
prolong indefinitely, and probably compromise, the ultimate
success of our cause.
" Hearken not to those boastful and vainglorious French,
and thick headed Germans, and hypochondriacal Englishmen,
who seem to think it possible to end Catholicism, at one time
by an obscene song, at another by an absurd sophism, and
again by a contemptible sarcasm. Catholicism has a vitality
which survives such attacks with ease. She has seen
adversaries more implacable and more terrible far, and
sometimes has taken a malicious pleasure in baptising with
holy water the most rabid amongst them. We may therefore
allow our brethren in those countries to work off their frenzy
of anti-catholic zeal, allow them to ridicule our Madonnas and
our apparent devotion. Under this cloak, we may conspire at
our convenience, and arrive, little by little, at our ultimate
aim.

CARBONARISM

431

" Therefore, the Papacy has been for seventeen hundred
years interwoven with the history of Italy. Italy can neither
breathe nor move without the leave of the Supreme Pontiff.
With him, she has the hundred arms of Briareus ; without him,
she is condemned to a lamentable impotency, and to divisions
and hostility, from the foot of the Alps to the last pass of the
Appen-nines. Such a state of things must not remain. It is
necessary to seek a remedy. Very well. The remedy is at hand.
The Pope, whoever he may be, will never enter into a secret
society. It then becomes the duty of the Secret Society to
make the first advance to the Church and to the Pope, with the
object of conquering both. The work for which we gird
ourselves up, is not the work of a day, nor of a month, nor of a
year.
" It may last for many years, perhaps for a century; in our
ranks the soldier dies, but the war is continued. We do not at
present intend to gain the Pope to our cause, nor to make him a
neophyte to our principles, or a propagator of our ideas. Such
would be an insane dream. Even should it happen that any
Cardinal, or any Prelate, of his own will, or by deception,
should share in our secrets, such would not be a reason for
desiring his exaltation to the Chair of Peter. Nay, his very
exaltation would be our ruin; for this reason that, his apostasy
being prompted by his ambition alone, that very ambition of
power would necessarily impel him to sacrifice us.
" Catholics ! what must we consider Freemasonry, when
Freemasons themselves pronounce it an apostasy from
Catholicity, and foresee that a power fully acquainted with
them and their machinations would, as a consequence, seek to
crush them.
" That which we should seek, that which we should await,
as the Jews await a Messiah, is a Pope according

432

OCCULT THEOCRASY

to our wants. An Alexander VI would not suit us, for he never
erred in religious doctrine ; a Pope Borgia would not suit us,
for he was excommunicated by all the thinking philosophers
and unbelievers for the vigour with which he defended the
Church. We require a Pope for ourselves, if such a Pope were
possible. With such a one we should march more securely to
the storming of the Church than with all the little books of
our French and English brothers.
" And why ? Because it were useless to seek with these
alone to split the rock upon which God has built his Church.
We should not want the vinegar of Hannibal, nor gunpowder,
nor even our arms, if we had but the little finger of the
successor of Peter engaged in the plot ; that little finger would
avail us more for our crusade than all the Urbans II and St.
Bernards for the crusade of Christianity. We trust that we may
yet attain this supreme object of our efforts.
" But when ? and how ? The unknown cannot yet be seen.
Nevertheless, as1 nothing should move us from our
mapped-out plan, we must labour at our newly-commenced
work as if tomorrow were to crown it with success. We wish,
in this Instruction, which should be kept concealed from those
simply initiated, to give advice to the rulers of the Supreme
Vendita, which they, in turn, should inculcate in the brethren
by means of Insegnamento, or Memorandum.
" Little can be done with old Cardinals and with prelates of
decided character. Such incorrigibles must be left to the
school of Gonsalvi, and in our magazines of popularity and
unpopularity, we must find the means to utilize, or ridicule,
power in their hands. A well invented report must be spread
with tact amongst good Christian families : such a Cardinal,
for instance, is a miser : such a prelate is licentious ; such an
official

CARBONARISM

433

is a freethinker, an infidel, a Freemason, and so on in the
same strain. These things will spread quickly to the cafes,
thence to the squares, and one report is sometimes enough to
ruin a man.
" If a prelate, or bishop, arrive in a province from Rome, to
celebrate or officiate at some public function, it is necessary
at once to become acquainted with his character, his
antecedents, his temperament, his defects — especially his
defects. If he should be our enemy — an Albani, a Pallotta, a
Bernetti, a Delia Genga, a Riva-rola — at once trap him,
entangle him in all the nets and snares you can. Give him a
character which must horrify the young people and the
women ; describe him as cruel, heartless, and bloodthirsty ;
relate some atrocious transaction which will easily cause a
sensation amongst the people. The foreign newspapers will
learn and copy these facts, which they will know how to
embellish and colour according to their usual style.
" For respect due to truth show, or better still, quote from
some respectable fool as having quoted the number of the
journal which has given the names, acts and doings of these
personages. As in England and in France, so also in Italy
there will be no lack of writers who well know how to tell lies
for the good cause, and have no difficulty in doing so. One
newspaper publishing the name of a Monsignor Delegate, His
Excellency, or Eminence, or Lord Justice, will be quite
sufficient proof for the people ; they will require no other.
The people here around us in Italy are in the infancy of
Liberalism. At present they believe in the Liberals, after a
little they will believe in anything. "
Modern Carbonarism was founded in 1815 by Maghella, a
native of Genoa, who, at the time when Joachim Murat
became King of the two Sicilies, was a subordinate of
Saliceti, the Neapolitan Minister of

434

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Police. He was a Freemason, who exempted from initiation
and probation all Freemasons who desired to become
Carbonari. Any one who has read the statutes and ritual of
Carbonarism will see that it is one and the same as that of
Masonry. 3
A sequence of events pertaining to Carbonarism can be
traced by the perusal of several works from which we quote :
At a meeting held on Oct. 13th 1820 by the Grand Secret
Consistory, the Orient of Scotland was recognized. The two
Consistories of Masonry in France and in Italy and that of the
Sublime Carbonari were put into communication and their
co-operation assured.4
The high ruling grades of the Carbonari appear to have
been those of Sublime Maitre Parfait, above which was still
another that of the Sublime Elus. 5
The Alta Vendita constituted the Supreme Directory of the
Carbonari and was led by a group of Italian noblemen,
amongst whom a prince, " the profoundest of initiates, was
charged as Inspector General of the Order. "
Piccolo Tigre, a certain nondescript Jew, rushed about
Europe obeying orders and presumably giving them, but what
he actually did has remained a mystery.
Giuseppe Mazzini had been initiated Carbonaro in
6
1827. Some time after, Carbonarism combined, or
rather coalesced, with the Society known as Young
Italy led by Mazzini whose aims were identical with
those of the Carbonari.

Young Italy, Young Poland, Young England, Young

all international movements of the same character working
towards the same end, viz. the supremacy of the Masters.
The Guelphic Knights, whose object was the independence
of Italy, to be effected by means of all the secret societies of
the country under their leadership, found able helpers in the
Carbonari.
" The Chiefs of the Carbonari were also chiefs among the
Guelphs ; but only those that had distinct offices among the
Carbonari could be admitted among the Guelphs. There can
be no doubt that the Carbonari when the sect had become very
numerous, partly sheltered themselves under the designation
of Guelphs and Adelphi or Independents, by affiliating
themselves to these societies. " 7
At one time the support of the Carbonari was offered by
Maghella to Murat with the advice to declare against
Napoleon and to proclaim the independence of Italy but
Murat's subsequent proscription of the sect induced it to seek
the support of England. The Bourbons and Lord William
Bentinck favoured it while Murat ordered its extermination.
Some of its leaders indeed perished but shortly afterwards the
society was reorganized and a schismatic sect calling itself
Calderari (Braziers) came into being. 8

" R. W. Moffrey (Century p. 18) fixes the year 1810 as that
in which the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows started, though
it was not till 1814 that the minutes of its Grand Committees
began to be printed... however Spry (Hist, of Oddfellowship p.

Order of Oddfellows, dated 12th March 1748, from which it
would seem that eight previous lodges had been established
before that date. "
For the connection of this order with Freemasonry see

We also note the following : —
" The position of Friendly Societies generally before the
introduction of National Insurance is shown in the report of

THE

HETAIRIA

LXVII
OF

GREECE

(ETHERISTS)

(Founded 1814)

Hetairia was the Greek name for societies, organizations or
associations. In ancient Greece the name hetairia applied to
companies in the army. In more modern times, it was used for
societies of learning, or commercial purposes and also for
political secret societies.
It is in connection with the latter that we are concerned.
While Greece was under Turkish dominion, the national
aspirations of its people could be vented in secret only. The
breath of revolution which swept Europe during the latter part
of the 18th century stirred some of the Greek patriots whose
aims was the overthrow of the Turkish power. The main
leader at that time was Constantin Rhygas (1754-1798).
He formed the first secret societies of Hetairias which
were mainly composed of Klephtes or bandits. Bound by oath,
each member of the society was to use all means,
assassination included, to free Greece. The execution of
Rhygas drove the hetairias to seek cover but in 1814, a chief
lodge was re-formed in Odessa under the name of Hetairia
phileke. Its avowed aim was
438

THE

HETAIRIA

OF GREECE

439

the liberation of Greece, and its main seat was in Russia.
Every candidate took an oath, as in all secret societies, and
knew no one beyond his initiator and sponsor. Funds,
collected and administered by a superior council directing all
the lodges, were kept in Russia.
When a sufficient number of Hetairias were organized and
a chief needed to direct the movement against Turkey, Count
Capo d'lstria, (John, 1776-1831) a Greek, minister in Russia
under the Tzar Alexander I, and author of the text of the Holy
Alliance was asked to take the lead but refused, and
Alexander Ypsilanti was nominated. The insurrection broke
out in 1821.
Among the most prominent members of the Hetairia we
find Alexander Mavrocordato (1791-1865) who was under
the influence of England and was also the friend of Byron
whom he had met in Missolonghi in 1822. From him he
received funds for the purchase of arms to the extent of one
hundred thousand francs. It is related that Lord Byron died in
his arms at Missolonghi in 1824. Among the supporters of the
London Branch of the Philhellenic Committee were Jeremy
Bentham, Sir Francis Burdett, Lord Erskine, Lord Ebrington,
Sir John Cam Hobhouse, (afterwards Lord Brougham) Joseph
Hume, Sir James Mackintosh and Lord John Russell. These
foreign committees provided arms, money and volunteers.

There were five grades namely : —
The Adelphoi (Brothers, who took an oath of secrecy but
ignored the aims of the society),
The Systemenoi (Bachelors, who knew that Greece was to
be freed by revolution),
The Priests of Eleusis,
The Prelates (knowing all the secrets),
The Grand Arch (The supreme directing control of 12
members).
" Early in 1827 a motion was unanimously adopted by the
Senate favouring the placing of Greece under the protection
of Great Britain. " This followed a secret interview of
Mavrocordato with Sir Stratford Canning, but Mavrocordato
retired from public life " on the failure of his project for the
establishment of a constitutional kingdom under British
protection."
" Hostilities in Greece were finally terminated, in the
summer of 1828, by a convention concluded at Alexandria
between Admiral Codrington and Mehemet Ali, by which the
latter agreed to withdraw the Egyptian troops from the Morea.

The arbitrary government of Capo d'lstria ended on
October 24, 1831, when he was assassinated.

THE HUNG SOCIETY OF CHINA
(Founded about 1815)

This society has also been known as The Triad Society,
The Ghee Hon, The Society of Heaven and Earth (T'in Tei
Hui), Ts'ing-lin-Kiu, The San-ho-hoei and the Sam-ho-hui.
After the Emperor Kang Hsi issued a Sacred Edict in 1662,
ordering the suppression of Buddhism and Taoism in China,
the Hung and the White Lotus, the latter a Taoist mystical
society also known by the name " White Lily ", are said to
have united to fight the Manchu Dynasty as their common
enemy.
They are supposed to have finally merged towards 1815 as
a secret political occult organization.
In 1851 the Hung broke into open revolt against the
Manchus. This is known as the Taiping Revolt and is often
alluded to as " The Triad War ". It was led by a village
schoolmaster called Hung who, after his defeat by Gordon in
1864, committed suicide.
Since the Taiping revolt the Society has been less
conspicuous but it is supposed nevertheless to have inspired
the successful revolution which in 1911 overthrew the
Manchu Dynasty and established the Repub441

lie of which Dr. Sun Yat-Sen assumed the presidency on
January 1, 1912.
Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, nominally a Christian, was a member of
the Hung Society, and his first official action as the first
President of the Chinese Republic was to enable Yuan Shi-Kai
to unite all parties under his presidency. He then accepted for
himself the Presidency of Nanking. The people received his
proclamation announcing these changes in front of the Ming
tombs, and listened while he told the spirits of the Mings that
the Manchu despotism, having faller, China was now a
Republic.
The Hung 1 having been outlawed since 1890 in China as a
terrorist organization, now, as a secret society, holds its
meetings in the woods at night with the approaches well
guarded.
The English branch of this society is at Liverpool where it
operates as a mutual benefit and charitable institution.

CARBONARISM

(Founded 1820)
The Masonic Lodge Les Amis de la Verite was founded in
1820 by Buchez, Flotard, Bazard and Jou-bert, all
Freemasons, for political purposes. On a riot incited by
members of this lodge a young man was killed. As a
consequence of his death this lodge went out of existence.
One of its former members, Dugied, a Freemason, was
initiated into the mysteries of Carbonarism while at Naples. 1
Having conceived the project of introducing this association
into France he discussed the matter with another ex-member
of the Ami's de la Verite, Flotard, and together they decided
to put the idea into practice by taking as a nucleus of the new
organization the remains of Les Amis de la Verite.
The society was organized as follows :—
The one " Haute Vente ", central " Ventes " and individual
" Ventes " (lodges).
The "Haute Vente" was the committee of direction and
action. Two members of the committee having found an
adept, the adept would agree with them to
1. Thomas Frost, The Secret Societies of the European Revolution, vol.

form a " Vente ". The adept would become President one of
the others censor, the other deputy, the role of the last being to
keep in touch with the committee while allowing the
president to believe that this committee was only a superior
degree of the association; The censor's business was to
inspect the work of the " Ventes ". These three chiefs were
then required to annex 17 recruits, thus bringing the number
of a lodge up to twenty. Thus constituted, this group was
called a central " Vente ". Two of its m?mbers made below
what had been made above them, forming an individual "
Vente " of the first order, which, repeating the same process
formed an ordinary individual " Vente " thus extending
indefinitely the ramifications of the sect.
A similar organization, but under different names, was
adapted to the army. There the Haute Vente was called the
Legion, the central Ventes, the Cohortes, the individual
Ventes of the first order the Centuries ; and the ordinary
individual Ventes the Manipules.
This double system was intended to puzzle the police, by
making it believe that there was a separate association in the
army. A further measure of precaution forbade a Carbonaro,
under penalty of death, being affiliated to another Vente. This
precaution was intended to prevent anyone entering different
groups and thus possibly discovering and denouncing the
seerets of the society.
The direction of the Ventes was indeed centralized but this
unity of control was to be ignored by most of the members.
The Carbonari had no settled principles. It accepted all
opinions provided these favoured the elimination of royal
families. The imperialists and liberals formed important
nuclei. The latter, the sons of middle-class

FRENCH CARBONARISM

449

parents, stirred against the government by patriotism, youth
and class jealousy, dreamed only of grabbing the influence of
the old families. As for what is called the people, it did not
count in Carbonarism ; the illustrious role attributed to it later
had not yet been invented !
To begin with, the Haute Yente counted only seven
members : Dugied, Flotard, Bazard, Buchez, Joubert, Carriol,
Limperani. Among them we find again the four heads of the
Amis de la Verite.
The Carbonari having prospered, the Haute Vente found it
advisable to annex some notable characters. Among others,
the Freemason General Lafayette, who, even in old age, had a
childish weakness for popularity, accepted the offer to join
the conspiracy.
Towards the end of 1820 the society had many branches,
notably those of Bordeaux, Nantes, Toulouse, La Bochelle,
Poitiers, Colmar, Belfort, etc.
The subversive efforts of this society culminated in an
abortive attempt at Bevolution at La Bochelle, and the
subsequent arrest of many of its principal members
completed its nominal dissolution.
After the debacle at La Rochelle the Amis de la Verite
merged into the Amis du Peuple which in turn, in 1832,
became the Droits de I'Homme. After its unsuccessful
attempt to assassinate the king, (Louis Philippe) in 1835 the
remains of the Droits de I'Homme reorganized as the Societe
des Families with Blanqui and Barbes as leaders. According
to Lucien de la Hodde,2 Carbonarism in France had ceased to
exist by 1822, except for a few obstinates like Charles Teste,
(a friend of Babeuf) and Buonarotti who remained

faithful to the old organization. Lucien de la Hodde however,
while following Carbonarism, lost sight of the Haute Vente
which, working through Mazzini and the International
Committee of London, directed its work of destruction in
France through Ledru Rollin and Felix Pyat. After its collapse
in 1836 the Societe des Families became that of the Saisons
(seasons) and it was a branch of this society, the Societe dissidents, that served the purpose of the Haute Vente in 1848 by
aiding in the terrorisation of Paris and the fall of the
Monarchy.
The self-appointed members of the provisional government of France after the abdication of the king were : —
Dupont (de l'Eure) Member of the original Carbonari
founded in 1820, Arago, Lamartine, Ledru Rollin,
Garnier-Pages, Marie, Cremieux.
Lucien de la Hodde was the agent of the French Secret
Police, and for 8 years before the revolution of 1848
occupied an exalted position in the ranks of the
Revolutionaries.
His conclusions are strangely at variance with the facts
which he relates. On page 381, he tells how an indiscretion on
the part of Caussidiere, one of his associates, placed the
blame of a conspiracy upon Ledru Rollin and, because Ledru
Rollin calmly denied knowledge of the affair, de la Hodde
accepts his statement without question.
Though a bona-fide student of the subject, it is quite
evident that de la Hodde had failed to grasp the principle
upon which Revolutionary organizations operate, viz : that of
a body of dupes whose particular job is genuinely to believe
that their organization is the executive one. Into this one all
persons of doubtful revolutionary integrity are steered,
and, in

this branch of the machine, conscientiously attend to their business,
while the real agents do their savage work.

MODERN KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
POLAND
(Founded 1822)
Heckethorn1 tells us of a sect which arose in Poland in
1818 which he refers to as that of " National Freemasonry ",
which borrowed the rites, degrees, and language of
Freemasonry, but aimed at national independence. The
society was open to persons of all classes, but sought chiefly
to enlist soldiers and officials, so as to turn their technical
knowledge to account in the day of the struggle. But though
numerous, the society lasted only a few years : for disunion
arose among the members, and it escaped total dissolution
only by transformation. It altered its rites and ceremonies,
and henceforth called itself the " Scythers ", in remembrance
of the revolution of 1794, in which whole regiments, armed
with scythes, had gone into battle.
They met in 1821 at Warsaw, and drew up a new
revolutionary scheme, adopting at the same time the new
denomination of " Patriotic Society". In the

meanwhile, the students of the university of Wilna had
formed themselves into a secret society which, however, was
discovered by the Russian government and dissolved. In
1822, the Patriotic Society combined with the masonic rite of
"Modern Templars", founded in Poland by Captain Maiewski;
to the three rites of symbolical masonry was added a fourth,
in which the initiated swore to do all in his power towards the
liberation of his country. These combined societies brought
about the insurrection of 1830. In 1834 was established the
society of " Young Poland " by Simon Konarski.
Simon Konarski (1808-1839) was a young Polish patriot
and poet, one of the most active members of the Young
Poland movement founded by Joseph Mazzini in 1834. He
travelled to France, England and Belgium and, in the latter
country, namely in Brussels, was in constant touch with
Lelewel who had been chosen by Mazzini to become the link
between himself and the Polish revolutionists. In Paris, the

movement
was
directed
by
Zwierkowsky.
Simon Konarski was seized by the Russian authorities and
executed in 1839 at Wilna.

BRAHMO

SOMAJ

(Founded 1830)

The Brahmo Somaj movement, also called Brah-moism or
Brahmaism, was founded by Rajah Ram Mohun Roy
(1774-1833), in 1830.
Its main object was to fight idolatrous rites and practices,
and, by many, it has been described as a " Hindu Unitarian
Church. "
The chief achievement of Ram Mohun Roy was the
abolition by Lord William Bentinck of the practice of " suttee
" (sacrifice of the widow on the funeral pyre of her husband).
Ram Mohun Roy's principles were Theistic. He had also
for several years studied Lamaism in the Himalayas. Having
come to England in 1830, he was received with much honour
by many sections of society and entertained by Louis Philippe.
He was considered a great authority by all those who at that
time were conducting spiritualist and psychic researches. He
died at Bristol.
A great impulse was given to the Brahmo Somaj by
Debendra Nath Tagore (also written Devendranath Takur)
who had joined it in 1842 and is considered as its second
founder.
455

456

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Owing to his efforts, the institution became purely Theistic,
giving up the authority of the Yedas and eliminating the
Vedantic element from the Brahmic covenant. In 1856,
Debendra Nath Tagore had also gone to the Himalayas where
he spent three years as a disciple of the Tibetan Lamas. Later,
he was joined in his work by his friend Keshub Chunder Sen
who, however, in 1863, devoured by the ambition of
becoming sole leader, attacked the Somaj, heading what one
might call the revolt of the " Young Brah-maists " and with
his followers seceded from the Mother organization.
The schism gave rise to the formation of another Somaj
which was directed by Keshub Chunder Sen under the name
Somaj of India, whereas the former organization, remaining
under the leadership of Debendra Nath Tagore, was called
Adi Samaj or Original Church. It was also named "
Conservative ", in opposition to the new institution termed "
Progressive ".
Keshub Chunder Sen retained power in his organization ;
the foundation stone of the Somaj of India Church was laid at
Jhamapukur in Calcutta, in 1868. In 1870 he journeyed to
England where he was enthusiastically received by the
spiritualist centres of the day, and succeeded in exciting much
interest in the political, social and religious affairs of India. In
1878, his disregard for the rules of the Somaj regarding
Hindu marriages which he infringed in the matter of the
wedding of his own daughter to the young Maharajah of
Kuch Behar, caused another split in the ranks of the Somaj of
India. The dissidents then formed the Sadharan Brahmo
Somaj.
The career of Keshub Chunder Sen must be followed with
interest by students of Theosophy. Therein will they find
many of the odd principles and injunctions

BRAHMO

SOMAJ

457

laid down by H. P. Blavatsky and Annie Besant. For instance,
the theocratic system was that promoted by Keshub Chunder
Sen in his efforts to found a universal religion which would
unite all creeds and symbols ; the Christian Cross, the
Crescent, the Vedic Om, the Saiva's trident and the
Vaishnava's Khunti. By means of imaginary pilgrimages, he
led his adherents successively to the shrines of Moses,
Buddha, to the Himalayan heights and Lama teachers, to
Jesus and to Mahomet.
Similarly to Annie Besant's Khrishnamurti, he allowed
himself to be worshipped as the Saviour of Sinners ; his
theory was the reincarnation of Great Men of which he was
one. Further, he complacently allowed his followers to raise
him to the dignity of a deity. As the Kheshub Chunder Sen's
worship increased, there grew also the dogma of Divine
Injunction. A salient feature of Keshub's teaching was the
belief or blind faith in the revelations claimed to have been
made to invisible teachers and spiritual guides and exaction
of blind obedience to their commands. We are forcibly
reminded of the claim made by H. P. Blavatsky to her
followers to sign their blind acceptance of all orders
presumably received from invisible masters like her Koot
Hoomi.
Another feature which, later, distinguished Keshub
Chunder Sen's devotees was the " Bhakti " side of their
religion. Unlike " Yoga ", the old Hindu type of religious
meditation or contemplation, " Bhakti ", which has been
chiefly developed by the followers of Chay-tania in India, is a
manifestation of religious frenzy. It spurns the aspiration to
approach God by concentration of thought and desire as well
as silent communion, which they deem unprofitable and vain.
The philosophy of " Bhakti " is that the love of God must

458

OCCULT THEOCRASY

be strong to the point of being maddening. It therefore
induces dancing, sobbing, swooning. The more frenzied the
manifestations, the greater the religious perfection. A great
Bhakta is one who, like the founder of the school, shows the
greatest religious madness.
Women devotees of Keshub Chunder Sen's following were
formed into a sisterhood in 1881 and one hears of " ladies'
journies to the Spirit land ". The readers of " Inquire Within "
1
will remember the description of " journeys in the Astral "
claimed to have been accomplished by women adepts of the
Stella Matutina Order. Soon after, also in 1881, young men
were likewise formed into a brotherhood and were initiated
into different holy orders. In both cases, the number of
initiates was 11. The ceremony of initiation was called New
Horn, Sacred Fire or Blazing Agni. Most of the rites are
found in the different branches of Theosophy and
Anthroposophy, all centred around this sacred fire also
named Kundalini.
In 1880, Keshub Chunder Sen had given his organization
another name, that of " The New Dispensation ".
It is in the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia that one must
seek the amalgamation of Jewish Cabala magic and Hindu
magic. The latter swept over Europe with the spread of
Theosophy and flourished particularly in England. There it
had found a ground in 1830 with the teachings given by Ram
Mohun Roy to the spiritualists of that day with whom he had
formed a Brahmo Somaj circle.

THE MORMONS
(Founded 1830)

Soon after the establishment of Mormonism its founder,
Joseph Smith, conceived the idea of establishing a Masonic
super rite.
In M. R. Werner's book Brigham Young (page 62) the
following remark makes this evident.
" Masonry was always popular with the Mormons until
Joseph Smith claimed that an angel of the Lord had brought
him the lost key-words of several degrees, enabling him to
progress further than the highest Masons. The charter of the
Mormon lodge was then taken away by the Grand Lodge ".
Joseph Smith, applying his powers of mediumship towards
the realization of the ambitious project nurtured by General
Pepe, Mazzini and others for the establishment of a super rite,
was not necessarily acceptable to the Masonic leaders of his
time.
Thus as a Mason he failed but as the founder of a Masonic
sect he succeeded.
So much has already been written about the sect of the
Mormons that we confine ourselves here to a short sketch of
opinion and descriptions given by various authors. The
following is extracted from The Encyclopaedia Britannica,
9th Edition.
459

460

OCCULT THEOCRASY

" This is a religious non-Christian sect, founded by Joseph
Smith at Manchester, New York, in 1830, now settled in Salt
Lake City, Territory of Utah, United States... Smith was born
Dec. 23rd, 1805, at Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, from
which place ten years later his parents, a poor, ignorant,
thriftless, and not too honest couple, removed to New York,
where they settled on a small farm near Palmyra, Wayne
County (then Ontario). Four years later, in 1809, they
removed to Manchester, some six miles off; and it was at the
latter place when fifteen years old that Joseph began to have
his alleged visions, in one of which on the night of 21st Sept.,
1823, the angel Moroni appeared to him three times, and told
him that the Bible of the Western Continent, the supplement
to the New Testament, was buried in a certain spot near
Manchester. Thither, four years later and after due
disciplinary probation, Smith went, and had delivered into his
charge by an angel of the Lord a stone box, in which was a
volume, 6 inches thick, made of thin gold plates 8 inches by 7,
and fastened together by three gold rings. The plates were
covered with small writing in the ' reformed Egyptian ' tongue,
and were accompanied by a pair of supernatural spectacles,
consisting of two crystals set in a silver bow, and called ' Urim
and Thummim '; by aid of these, the mystic characters could
be read. Being himself unable to read or write fluently, Smith
employed as amanuensis one Oliver Cowdery, to whom from
behind a curtain, he dictated a translation, which, with the aid
of a farmer, Martin Harris, 1 who had more money than wit,
was printed and published in 1830 under the title of The Book
of Mormon and accom1. Harris married as one of his many wives the widow of
the murdered Mason, William Morgan.

THE MORMONS

461

panied by the sworn statement of Oliver Cowdery, David
Whitmer, and Martin Harris, that an angel of God had shown
them the plates of which the bock was a translation. This
testimony all three, on renouncing Mormonism some years
later, denounced as false ; but meanwhile it helped Smith to
impose on the credulous, particularly in the absence of the
gold plates themselves which suddenly and mysteriously
disappeared. "
Blanchard draws a parallel between this story of the gold
plates and that of the legend of the 14th degree of Scottish
Rites Masonry, that of Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime
Mason, according to which " the real name oi God was lost,
till it was found by Masons, engraved on a three-cornered
gold plate, in " the ruins of Enoch. "2
In reality, this book " was written in 1812 as an historical
romance by one Solomon Spalding, a crack-brained preacher;
and the MS. falling into the hands of an unscrupulous
compositor, Sidney Rigdon, was copied by him, and
subsequently given to Joseph Smith. Armed with this book
and with self-assumed divine authority, the latter soon began
to attract followers. " 3
Joseph Smith was a Mason.
The Gold Plate trick, having worked so successfully once,
was tried again in 1843 when six plates were found by Robert
Wiley, a merchant of Kinderhook, Illinois. " The true story of
the plates was disclosed " so Stuart Martin writes in The
Mystery of Mormonism (page 69), in an affidavit made by W.
Fulgate, of Mount Station, Brown County, 111. on June 30th,
1879, when he swore before J. Brown, Justice of the Peace,
that the " plates were humbug, gotten up by Robert
Wiley,

Bridge Whitton, and myself. Whitton, who was a blacksmith,
cut the plates out of pieces of copper. Wiley and I made the
hieroglyphics by making impressions of beeswax and filling
them with acid. " He describes the burial and the finding of
the plates, and states that among the spectators at the "
discovery " were two Mormon Elders, Marsh and Sharp.
Smith and his followers founded the city of Nauvoo and "
such were the powers granted them by this charter as to
render the city practically independent of the State
Government, and to give Smith all but unlimited civil power.
He organized a military body called the Nauvoo legion, of
which he constituted himself commander with the title of
lieutenant-general, while he was also president of the church
and mayor of the city. On April 6th, 1841, the foundations of
the new temple were laid, and the city continued to grow
rapidly in prosperity and size. "
Smith's career of treason, profligacy, dishonesty,
polygamy, spiritism and humbug, came to an abrupt end
when the gaol in which he was imprisoned by order of the
Governor of the State was broken into by a mob who shot him
and his fellow prisoner, his brother Hyram.
As head of the Mormons he was succeeded by Brigham
Young (1801-1877).
In 1846, the repeal by the legislature of the charter of
Nauvoo resulted in the Mormons being driven from the city.
In March 1849, they held a convention at Salt Lake City,
and a State was organized under the name of " Deseret ". "A
legislature was elected and a constitution framed, which was
sent on to Washington. This, Congress refused to recognize,
and by way of compromise for declining to admit the
proposed new State

into the Union, President Fillmore in 1850 organized the
country occupied by the Mormons into the Territory of Utah,
with Brigham Young as governor. " Adopting Smith's policy
of aggressive military action, Brigham Young, like his
predecessor, defied the Federal Government. He died on
August 29, 1877, leaving 17 wives and 56 children. 4
The following description of a Mormon ceremony was
printed in the Rosicrucian in an article entitled " Ancient and
Modern Mysteries " by M. W. Frater Robert Wentworth Little
(page 169).
" The converts are then required to purchase white linen
garments, which are furnished by the ' high deacon '. They are
then conducted to the temple, ushered into a private room, and
commanded to undress for the inspection of the presiding
elder '. This official, after a minute examination, clothes the
neophytes in the linen robes or garments of endowment and
conducts them into a large room which is divided by white
screens into many small compartments. Each neophyte enters
one of the compartments, and is ordered to take off the '
endowment robe ' and to step into a long coffin-shaped tin
bath. The elder then pours water upon the naked victim —
blessing each member of the body as the water touches it — '
the brain to be clear and strong — the eyes to be bright and
sharp — the ears to be quick to hear ', and so on down to the
feet — this ceremony being performed upon all, without
distinction of sex. A new name is then given to each convert
by the elder, who commands them to ' arise and follow me '. A
magnificent garden, full of exquisite fruit-trees, is the scene
of the next ceremony. The candidates are still in a state of
nudity, which represents primeval

innocence, and the Temptation of our First Parents is the
subject of the next drama. The women are directed by an
elder personating Satan to pluck an apple from a certain tree,
and after they have tasted, to hand it to the men. Brigham
Young then appears, and drives them out of the garden with a
flaming sword. They return to the temple, implore
forgiveness on their knees for all trespasses and
transgressions and the ceremony concludes with a
benediction upon the new Saints, pronounced by the lips of
this polygamous president.
" Such is a brief outline of the ' Rite of Endowment' the
details of the scene being, as may readily be conceived, of too
obscene a character to be explained at greater length. "
Brigham Young was succeeded by John Taylor, an
Englishman and a Freemason. His apostolic successors were
Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph Fielding Smith
(eldest son of the founder of the order) who died Nov. 19th,
1918, and Heber J. Grant.5
About Mormonism and Masonry, Blanchard makes the
following remark : " The two institutions are morally and
legally the same. " 6
The Mormon dogma is universality, materialism and
pantheism. It blends Judaism and Christianity, aiming at a
progressive universal religion while seeking to unite in itself
all faiths and the cults of every people on earth.
The Mormon state is a theocratic community at the head of
which is a grand priest-president assisted by two others and a
travelling council of twelve. Its mysteries are those of
spiritism and the seance room.

INDEPENDENT ORDER OF B'NAI B'RITH
I. O. B. B. (JEWISH MASONRY)

(Founded 1843)

B'nai B'rith means " Sons of the Covenant ", the Covenant
being that of circumcision practised according to the Mosaic
law. Hence the Independent Order of the B'nai B'rith admits
only Jews as members.
This rite "was founded in New York in 1843 by a number
of German Jews, headed by Henry Jones. " l
Its constitution, District Lodges, Grand Lodges, stamp it
as a Jewish Masonic Society.
Like most societies, it covers its political activities under
the cloak of " benevolence and philanthropy. "
From its inception until the present time, its main contact
has been with Germany and its chief aim the establishment of
the supremacy of the German Jews in all world affairs
through the channel of " Internationalism".
In 1882, the strength of the I. 0. B. B. in the United States
warranted the opening of Lodges in Germany by Moritz
Ettinger, and the growth of the order was s6 rapid there that
in 1885, Julius Bien, President of the Order in New York,
went over and inaugu1.

rated the first German Grand Lodge of the I. O. B. B.
The political activities of the leaders of the order in
Bumania, Austria and Hungary are a matter of record,
although the chief centre of their power is in the United States
where they have lately attained supremacy in the Jewish
World by absorbing " national " Zionism and submitting it
wholly to their own " international " policy when the Jewish
World Agency was created in October, 1928.
It will be well for the reader to bear in mind that, however
united a front the Jews may present to the Gentiles, yet
among themselves they are divided, and the fight for
supremacy and the attainment of world power is not less
bitter between their various camps than it is among the
different sects of Freemasonry.
Babbi Dr. Leo Bach was the president of the B'nai B'rith of
Germany in 1928.
The Grand Master for Bussia of the International Order of
the B'nai B'rith at the time of the Bussian revolution of 1917
was Sliozberg. He was one of the inspirers of Kerensky, the
leader of the first revolution of 1917. 2 Alexander Kerensky,
real name Aron Kirbiz, Kerensky having been the name of
his stepfather, was a member of the Socialist revolutionary
party and a 32nd degree Scottish Bites Mason.
There is but little doubt now that the B'nai B'rith seems to
be the supreme body, shaping and directing, for the
attainment of its own ends, the policies, whatever they may
be, of all Freemasonry beginning with the Grand Lodge of
England, The Grand Orient and Scottish Bites, and ending in
the O. T. O., which is Illuminism under another name.

YOUNG IRELAND
(Founded 1843)

Captain H. B. C. Pollard, in writing of the Young Ireland
movement says " The leaders of the Young Ireland Party of
1848 were John Mitchell, an advanced Radical, deeply tinged
with Jacobin ideas, and William Smith O'Brien, whose
brother later became Lord Inchiquin. They obtained popular
support by reason of the widespread misery caused by the
Potato famine of ' Black Forty-seven. ' Gavan Duffy, Dillon,
Doheny, O'Gorman and Stephens were all minor conspirators.
Mitchell and O'Brien were transported to Van Diemens Land,
but the younger men mostly made good their escape and lived
in exile in Paris and America. " '
" The old traditional combination of an open movement
within the law reinforced by a secret organization of criminal
habits was revived in 1850, when the Tenant Defence Society
was founded with the object of enforcing, by agitation,
legislation which was to accomplish by legal means that
expropriation of property that the combined genius of

terrorist societies had failed to achieve by violence. 2 " The
Archbishop of Dublin at that time was Archbishop Cullen, who was
familiar with the evils resulting from the effective use of Secret
Societies. He had been in Rome when the successful Carbonarists
under Mazzini and Garibaldi drove out the Pope ; 3 and the lesson
had not been wasted. Cullen readily ascertained that the Tenants'
Rights Party was merely a new disguise for the late ' Young Ireland
' movement, whose ideals were both Republican and, within limits,
anti-clerical.
" There was no formal excommunication, but a quiet though
firm ban was placed on the party. " 4
The Young Ireland Movement was but a branch of the Young
Europe Movement led by Mazzini, the main history of which will
be found in Part I.

THE BAHAI MOVEMENT
(Founded 1844)

" Inquire Within", in her book Light-bearers of Darkness,
gives an excellent summary of the crigin and scope of this sect.
From her work we quote the following :
" This movement was founded in 1844 by a Persian, Mirza
Ali Muhammad, who took the title of ' Bab ' (the Gate); he
revolted against the Hierarchy, who, fearing his growing
influence, had him shot at Tabriz, 1850.
" It claims to be the fulfilment ' of that which was but
partially revealed in previous dispensations ', and they look
upon Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, Mohammed, and Confucius
as merely preparing the world for the advent of the ' Most
Great Peace ' and the ' Mighty World Educator ' Baha'u'llah
(Glory of God), 1863-92, and later Abdul-Baha, 1892-1921.
It further claims to be the unity of all religions, also older and
modern movements, such as Theosophy, Freemasonry,
Spiritualism, Socialism, etc. ; it aims at conferring illumination upon humanity, and like all illuminated groups, it works
for universal peace, religion, education, language (Esperanto),
and universal everything leading to unity of humanity;
therefore all prejudices must be abandoned,
469

traditional, racial, patriotic, religious and political ; all
religions must be in accordance with science and reason. "
The Bahais have a temple in Chicago, the building of
which was begun in 1903 which " Inquire Within " describes
as being a perfect nonagon in form, all its dimensions being
based on the number nine, " the cabalistic number of
generation, which initiates and leads to unity with the
universal astral light. " 1
The same author further explains the organization of the
sect most concisely in the following lines :
" There is a Guardian of the Cause — Shogi-Effendi —
with nine co-workers, and in each town there is a Spiritual
Assembly of nine members, who must be consulted, absolutely obeyed, and submitted to. There are also National
Spiritual Assemblies in all countries to which the cause has
spread, and, finally, they are making elaborate plans to form
an International Spiritual Assembly to be elected by all
believers — to enact ordinances and regulations not found in
the explicit Holy Text. "
We leave it to anyone interested to follow the subversive
activities of this sect in either the political or religious realm.

" In 1819, Thomas Wildey established in Baltimore the
first lodge of Oddfellows in the United States, and from 1825
till 1833, he was Grand Sire of the Grand Lodge.
" In 1843 Grand Sire Howell Hopkins of Pennsylvania was
installed, and the United States Grand Lodge issued a
dispensation for opening the Prince of Wales Lodge No. 1 at
Montreal, Canada.

MODERN SPIRITISM
(Founded 1848)

Modern Spiritism, sometimes called Spiritualism, traces its
descent from the mystifications of Catherine and Margaret
Fox, the daughters of John Fox, who, in 1848, during the
course of experiments conducted in a haunted house at
Hydesville, New York, U. S. A. elaborated a system of
communication by raps, with invisible entities. Both sisters
eventually confessed to having abused the credulity of the
public in their spiritist seances but the universal interest
aroused by the phenomena at Hydesville did not abate.
Since then, there has been a regular epidemic of table
turning, ouija boards, planchettes, automatic writings and
similar modes, more or less effective, for achieving
mediumship.
The acquisition of this type of mediumship exposes the
aspirant to the danger of an induced state of mental passivity
during which the mind may register vibrations broadcast
from some terrestrial centre such as that provided by the
recently constituted " Polaire Society " and recognized by the
H. B. of L. (See page 531).
The cultivation of spiritism under all its different aspects
either for amusement or pseudo-scientific inves473

tigation leads to serious consequences when occult adepts
rely upon such manifestations for spiritual and material
guidance. One is appalled at the thought that even the
destinies of nations may become subject to occult direction
emanating from spiritistic seances. In connection herewith,
the following clipping shows the opeiation of these methods
on persons prominent in political life. As everyone knows,

drain their vital energy to such an extent that, when such
practices are indulged in for an appreciable length of time,
their nervous systems may be seriously impaired. A " Ouija "
medium, after a week's consecutive sittings will feel a sense
of heaviness and oppression about the solar plexus at certain
hours. This sensation is shortly followed by serious physical
weakness, manifest in sports-and athletics. Presently, the
medium — now a potential medical patient — will be unable
to sleep at night.
Cracks, bangs, knocks, etc., will mark an approaching state
of obsession. People whose psychic experiments have
brought them to this degree of development, generally cut
short further adventures in this field of science and theology.
These have learned that there is indeed something beyond the
obvious, and that after this stage of induced experimental
mediumship has been achieved the way is open for such
states of mind variously known to psychopathic doctors and
priests as lunacy, possession, obsession, alternating
personality and sadism.
Mediumship does not imply power. A medium is a
receiver and, as such, furthers the will of another. The fakirs
of India are mediums.
That these phenomena are real has been proved by such
prominent scientists as Crooks, Richet and Flam-marion and
the mediumistic exploits of such persons as D. I). Home are
so well known and attested that we will give but one short
extract here from page 171 of The Rosicrucian, quoting a
speech by Lord Lindsay, Senior Grand Warden of England,
for the benefit of persons who may happen to have no
acquaintance with the subject.
" I may mention that on another occasion I was sitting with
Mr. Home and Lord Adare and a cousin of his. During the
sitting Mr. Home went into a trance,.

and in that state was carried out of the window in the room
next to where we were, and was brought in at our window.
The distance between the windows was about seven feet six
inches and there was not the slightest foothold between them,
nor was there more than a twelve inch projection to each
window, which served as a ledge to put flowers on. "
What are we to think when we read in John Drink-water's
remarkable book on Charles James Fox that Sir Francis
Dashwood was Chancellor of the Exchequer under G?orge
III ?
Regarding the career of Sir Francis, we here read the
following. The comment concerns John Wilkes whose "
ambition to be admitted into the childish and blasphemous
fraternity notorious as the Monks of Medmenham was
frustrated by the claims of superior profligacy advanced by
the fourth Lord Sandwich, with whom he competed for
election. His resentment against that nobleman and Sir
Francis Dashwood, the founder of the Society, was not
appeased by the success of an exploit that diverted the town.
Wilkes contrived to let a baboon loose upon one of the
orgiastic rites at Medmenham that was being conducted in
darkness, and had the satisfaction of throwing his victims into
hysterics at the apparition of what their befuddled wits took
to be the devil. " 1
What indeed can be deduced from such an historical fact
as that Lord Sandwich, " notable even in that age as a
corrupter of morals ", was Secretary of State ?
The obvious conclusion we can draw is that men either
corrupt or easily bought are men easily blackmailed just as
those who, being victims of their own greed, are amenable to
bribery.

severely for an instance of judicial iticism of
the claims of spiritualists ade by Mr. Justice

Merely mentioning that the plaintiff won his

comments of the judge may be quoted full,
because reference was made the statute which
it is now sought to fiend
" It is an open question whether the
manifestations given by mediums are genuine
or mere tricks by which people are able to
represent that there is com-unication with the

conclusion that there is no certain desire to
deceive or impose, but that it is desired that
people should be puzzled as to whether there
is a genuine manifestation of spirits or w h e t
h e r it is trickery. " There are those who
believe that the spirits can communicate in
this world with those they have known,

through some medium. Their time is so
unoccupied in the next world, and it is such a
dreary place, that thev are perfectly ready to

"Before even they get on the stage they are
counting the pennies in Mr. —'s overcoat or the

" On the other hand, there are those who are
capable of supposing that this really is a kind of
existence imposed for eternity upon those who
have ceased to exist in life. If that is so, ' well
may we weep for friends who die '.
" All they (the plaintiffs) desired to do was to
give an exhibition which would leave some
people in doubt as to whether it was real
divination by means of the dead or some
trickery. No magistrate ought to convict them
on this account under the statute of George IV.

THE IRISH REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD (I. R
B.)
THE FENIANS.

(Founded 1857-1858)
Concerning this famous Secret Society, Captain Pollard
writes :
" From its earliest days to the present time the I. R. B. has
existed as a militant revolutionary secret society, with the
avowed object of separating Ireland from all connection with
the British Empire and establishing an independent
Republican Government. l
" The founders of this movement were Colonel John
O'Mahoney and a barrister, Michael Doheney, both of whom
had fled from Ireland for their share in the rising of 1848.
Both these men took refuge in France, at that time a hot-bed
of secret Carbonarist societies, such as the Communistes
Revolulionnaires, the Constitutional Society with its ' Acting
Company ', the Seasons and many others, and it was in Paris
that these two fugitives lived with James Stephens, the real
head and organizer of the Fenian movement, who was also a
refugee. "
" In 1857 a messenger was sent from New York to James
Stephens, then in Dublin, asking him to get

up an organization in Ireland on resources provided from the
States (U. S. A.) ; and it is clear that Stephens had already
cut-and-dried plans in his mind as to how this was to be done.
He stated his terms, which were agreed to, and on St. Patrick's
Day 1858, the I. R. B. movement was initiated by Stephens
and Luby in Dublin. "
In 1859 the I. R. B. exacted the following oath ; " I, A. B.,
in the presence of Almighty God, do solemnly swear
allegiance to the Irish Republic now virtually established ;
and that I will do my utmost, at every risk, while life lasts, to
defend its independence and integrity ; and finally that I will
yield implicit obedience in all things, not contrary to the laws
of God, to the commands of my superior officers. So help me
God. Amen. "
" The organization made rapid headway, but the weight of
the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was surging against the
movement, and in due course the Brotherhood was
excommunicated ; in 1861 no Fenian could get absolution. "
In reference to the founding of the Fenian society in
America, Heckethorn fifty years ago had written the
following :
" In Nov. 1863, the Fenian organization assumed a new
character. A grand national convention of delegates met at
Chicago and avowed the object of the Brotherhood, namely,
the separation of Ireland from England, and the establishment
of an Irish republic, the same changes being first to be
effected in Canada. Another grand convention was held in
1864 at Cincinnati, the delegates at which represented some
250,000 members, each of which members was called upon
for a contribution of five dollars, and this call, it is said, was
promptly responded to.... About the same time a Fenian
Sisterhood was established, and the

THE IRISH REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD

483

ladies were not inactive ; for in two months from their
associating they returned upwards of £200,000 sterling to the
Fenian Exchequer for the purpose of purchasing arms and
other war material. " 2
To raise money the Fenians issued bonds redeemable 90
days after the establishment of the future Irish Republic.
Availing ourselves of the remarkable documentation
furnished by Captain Pollard we gather the following facts :
" The American Fenian Brotherhood was a separate
organization, distinct from the Irish Fenian Brotherhood or I.
R. B. having its own leaders ; but both organizations were on
the same lines and had their officers, both civil and military
oaths, emblems, and passwords, funds and stores of arms. " 3
All was well till Sept. 14, 1865 when "the Dublin
authorities, who were thoroughly well informed, raided the
offices of The Irish People and arrested the staff.
James Stephens was arrested with the rest but " escaped
through the nominal complicity of a warder, John Breslin,
who was also a member of the I. R. B. "
" Stephens had received some twenty-five thousand
pounds, little of which was spent in Ireland, and in later years
it was a matter of common knowledge that Stephens, besides
being Head Centre, had also an agreement with the British
Government, which threw a peculiar light on his immunity
from arrest and his later escape from prison and leisurely
retreat to France. "4
On March 5, 1867, " Colonel " Kelly, heading a dissident
group of Fenians, established a Directory

separate from the original I. R. B. in London.
" Kelly, it should be noted, was the inventor of the
Committee of Safety, later known as the Assassination
Committee, whose function was to shoot people suspected of
' treason ' to the Brotherhood. "
" In 1869 new influences in America and Paris succeeded
in reforming the I. R. B. Directorate in London, a nd the
organization became not only a mainspring of revolutionary
endeavour in Ireland, but a definite element in the complex
machinery of world-revolution. "
In March 1865, the Fenians joined the amalgamation of
subversive Secret Societies under Karl Marx, known as the
International Association of Working Men, founded in
London on September 28th.
" It is, at all events, clear that Marx and the leaders of the I.
R. B. were in close touch, and that Marx knew, even if the
mass of Irish dupes did not, that the Irish revolutionary dream
of the I. R. B. and Fenian leaders was no merely nationalist
rebellion, but was to be a social revolution.5
" The function of the Fenian ' General ' Cluseret and his
relation to the International are not precisely clear, but he
appears to have acted as a chief of the military rather than the
civil side of the secret Lodges. During his stay in England on
his Fenian mission he paid particular attention to the problem
of how London might be captured, held and burnt.... After the
suppression of the Paris branch of the Internationale it was
Cluseret who organized the workers as a secret communist
revolutionary society. "
The more recent activities of the I. R. B. should be
followed in connection with The Clan-na-Gael.

PHOENIX SOCIETY OF SKIBBEREEN
(Founded 1858)
In our enumeration of subversive societies we must
include the Phoenix Society of Skibbereen of which Captain
Pollard writes the following in The Secret Societies of
Ireland (page 46).
" In 1858 a premature organization, contrived to revive the
tenets of the Young Irishmen of ten years earlier, was
founded at Skibbereen by Jeremiah O'Dono-van Rossa and
James Stephens. Both these men were later to attain notoriety
in criminal annals, but the Phoenix Society was abortive.
Attacked by the priests it was suppressed. "
This society is interesting to us on account of the
subsequent career of James Stephens, one of its founders,
who had previously been identified with the Fenian
movement.

L'ALLIANCE ISRAELITE UNIVERSELLE
(A BRANCH

OF JEWISH

MASONRY)

(Founded 1860)
If, as it has been appropriately defined, Judaism is a sect,
the creation of the Alliance Israelite Univer-selle which took
place in 1860 can be regarded as that of its exoteric centre.
It was founded in 1860 by Aristide Astruc, Isidor Cahen,
Jules Carvalho, Narcisse Leven, Eugene Manuel and Charles
Netter. Its first president was Konigs-warter. Adolphe
Cremieux was president from 1863-1867 and again from
1868-1880.
In 1840, the world had been startled by the news of the
fearful murder of Pere Thomas at Damascus. Serious
investigations had resulted in the conviction of three Jews
who had confessed to the commission of the abominable
crime for Jewish ritual purposes of procuring human blood.
The indignation of the whole world rising against Jewry
made its prominent members realise the danger threatening
their newly acquired emancipation in most countries, and they
made a concerted effort to disprove Jewish guilt in the
Damascus affair. Foremost among them had been Moses
Monte fiore, Adolphe Cremieux

L'ALLIANCE ISRAELITE UNIVERSELLE

and Solomon Munk. Yet, the real inspirer of the Alliance
Israelite Universelle was Hirsch Kalisher, Rabbi of Thorn
(Russia) and its enthusiastic exponent, Moses Hess.
The chief aim of the Alliance Israelite Universelle was
political, and was clearly expressed in the report circulated
after its foundation in which was stated : All important faiths
are represented in the world by nations, that is to say, they are
incarnated in governments especially interested in them and
officially authorized to represent them and speak for them
only. Our faith alone is without this important advantage; it is
represented neither by a state nor by a society, nor does it
occupy a clearly defined territory.
The Alliance Israelite Universelle therefore was destined to
be the governmental representative of all Jews from whatever
country they lived in under the authority of their secret Kahal
or community rule.
The first political manifestation of the Alliance Israelite
Universelle took place at the Berlin Congress in 1878 where it
was represented by three of its delegates : Kann, Netter and
Veneziani.
The link between the Alliance Israelite Universelle and
Freemasonry was for many years Adolphe Cre-mieux and
Masonic writers have asserted that the 18th degree, conferreo
by the Grand Orient, makes the initiate, if not a member, at
any rate a supporter of the Alliance.
The Alliance Israelite Universelle saw its dream of
international Jewish Government shattered when Zionism
emerged and came tc the fore in 1897. It is noteworthy that
the " Prophet " of Zionism : Ahad Ha'am (Asher Ginsberg)
was a member of the Alliance Israelite Universelle and a
disciple of Charles Netter. The avowed

aims of the A. I. U., namely a super-government of the world
and a universal religion, both to be Judaic, are being steadily
pursued by the " Jewish World Agency " functioning to-day.

THE INTERNATIONAL
( F I R S T AND

SECOND)

(Founded 1860)

In his early days, Karl Marx, later to be the moving spirit of
the First International, edited a paper in Paris, Annates
Franco-Allemandes, the organ of a secret society. This paper
had been founded by Arnold Riige, a disciple of Mazzini.
Marx met Riige through Henri Heine, the celebrated poet. l
Heckethorn, in his Secret Societies of All Ages and
Countries gives an interesting synopsis of the early phases of
this movement destined ultimately to form the keystone of
subversion throughout the world. 2
" The first attempt at an international society was made by
a small number of German workmen in London, who had
been expelled from France in 1839 for taking part in the riots
in Paris. Its members consisted of Germans, Hungarians,
Poles, Danes and Swedes. Of the few English members Ernest
Jones was one. The society was on friendly terms with the
English Socialists, the Chartists, and the London French
Democratic

Society. Out of that friendship sprang the Society of the
Fraternal Democrats, who were in correspondence with a
number of democratic societies in Belgium. In November,
1847, a German Communist Conference was held in London,
at which Dr. Karl Marx (real name Morde-chai) was present.
In the manifesto then put forth it was declared that the aim of
the Communists was the overthrow of the rule of the
capitalists by the acquisition of political power. The practical
measures by which this was to be effected were the abolition
of private property in land ; the centralization of credit in the
hands of the State — the leading agitators of course to be the
chiefs of the State — by means of a national bank ; the
centralization of the means of transport in the hands of the
State ; national workshops ; the reclamation and improvement
of land ; and the gratuitous education of all the children.
" In 1860, a Trade Unionist, Manhood Suffrage, and Vote
by Ballot Association was established, of which G. Odger, a
shoemaker, was chairman. As if it had not enough of what
might be called legitimate work to do, the association also
undertook to agitate in favour of Poland, for which purpose it
co-operated with the National League for the Independence of
Poland. The London International Exhibition of 1862 induced
the French government to assist many French workmen with
means to visit that exhibition... " and "... on the 5th August, all
the delegates met at a dinner given to them by their English
colleagues at Freemason's Hall, where an address was read
which formed, as it were, the foundation-stone of the International. The Imperial Commission that had enabled the
French workmen to visit the London Exhibition had no doubt
furnished them with return tickets. But several of the artisans
made no use of their second

THE

491

halves, since profitable employment in London was found for
them by their English brethren, so that they might form
connecting links between the workmen of the two countries. "
The next year, another meeting was arranged and this was
followed by others. At last one was held in London on Sept.
24, 1864, presided over by Professor Beesly, at which it was
finally determined to establish a permanent organization of
the working people of the civilized world. The International
Working Men's Association was thus founded. In The Jewish
Encyclopaedia, Article on Karl Marx, we read that Mazzini
and Marx were entrusted with the task of preparing the
address and the constitution. Then came the big public
meeting held on September 28, 1864 at St. Martin's Hall,
which " declared the International Working Men's
Association to be established and congresses were appointed
to be held at different times and places to decide on the
measures to be taken to found the working men's Eldorado.
Many societies at first were affiliated, but dissensions soon
broke out among them, and many, such as the Italian Working
Men's Society, withdrew again. " 3
This withdrawal of the Italian section was doubtless
influenced by its recognition of the subversion of the original
scheme for the amelioration of industrial conditions by the
Mazzinian revolutionary agents.
" At a meeting held in London, in 1865, the '
re-establishment of Poland entire and independent ' was again
one of the questions discussed. The Paris delegates were for
avoiding political questions; but Mr. Odger reminded them
that Poland had furnished the occasion for the establishment
of the association,
3. Heckethorn, op. cit.

492

and that the Conference must stand by the Polish cause.
"
In 1866, a meeting or congress was held at Geneva, where
the abolition of standing armies, the destruction of the
monopolies of great companies, and the transfer of railways
and other means of locomotion to the people, were decided on.
Another resolution favouring Polish Independence was
passed and the report of Marx made in 1864 was adopted.

expropriation of all existing proprietors, by the abolition of
the political and legal state, which is the sanction and only
guarantee of all property as now existing, and of all that is
called legal right; and the expropriation, in fact, everywhere,
and as much and as quickly as possible by the force of events
and circumstances. ' " 4
After such remarks, the International was evidently
considered by its masters to have shown its mettle and to be
deserving of better quarters. " A temple worthy of their cult
was sought and found... near Geneva, where... a fine building,
the Masonic Temple — Temple Unique... was procured. ...
They put the name of Temple on their cards and bills. Their
cult had gained a worthy shrine... " 5
The further aims of the movement are thus described by
Heckethorn:
"... At the time when the International was founded, the
French Empire was as yet in all its strength and.... its ministers
looked upon themselves as small Machia-vellis when they
permitted the International (which claimed to be a social,
non-political organization), to grow in order, some day, to use
it against a mutinous bourgeoisie. The Emperor had an
opportunity on September 2, at Sedan, and the Empress on
September 4, at Paris, to judge of the value of such policy.
However, the scheme of the association having been settled in
London in 1864, the organizers opened at Paris a bureau de
correspondance, which was neither formally interdicted nor
regularly authorized by the Prefect and the Minister. But the
constantly growing power of the International shown by the
strikes of

Roubaix, Amiens, Paris, Geneva, etc. after a time compelled
the government either to direct or to destroy it. The Parisian
manifesto read at Geneva was stopped at the French frontier ;
but M. Rouher agreed to admit it into France, if the
association would insert some passages thanking the Emperor
for what he had done for the working classes —a suggestion
which was received with derision by the members. In the
meantime the old revolutionary party, of which Mazzini,
Garibaldi, Blanqui, and Ledru-Rollin were the oracles, looked
with suspicion on the foundation of the International; for, as
this last declared that it would not meddle with politics, the
others called out, Treason ! and thus the two parties were soon
in a condition of violent opposition. In 1867, the Congress of
Lausanne voted against war, but at the same moment the other
fraction of the demagogues, assembled at Geneva, under
pretence of forming a congress of peace, declared war on all
tyrants and oppressors of the people. However, the two
parties, the bourgeois demagogues and the workmen demagogues, eventually united ; and thus it came to pass that by
virtue of this pact the International took part in two
revolutionary manifestations which occurred about six weeks
after — the one at the tomb of Manin in the cemetery of
Montmartre, and the other on the following day on the
Boulevard Montmartre, to protest against the French
occupation of Rome. The International having thus been
carried away to declare war against the government, the latter
determined to prosecute it. The association was declared to be
dissolved, and fifteen of the leaders were each fined a
hundred francs. The International taking no notice of the
decree of dissolution, a second prosecution was instituted,
and nine of the accused were condemned to imprisonment for
three months. The International now hid itself

THE

INTERNATIONAL

495

amidst the multitude of working men's societies of all
descriptions that were either authorized or at least tolerated,
and made enormous progress so that its chiefs at last declared
themselves able to do without any extraneous support. ' The
International', said one of the speakers at the Bale Congress
(1869), ' is and must be a state within states ; let these go on as
suits them, until our state is the strongest. Then, on the ruins
of these, we shall erect our own fully prepared, such as it
exists in every section. '
" On September 3rd 1870, the disaster of Sedan became
known at Paris. On the next day, Lyons, Marseilles, Toulouse,
and Paris proclaimed the Republic. This simultaneous
movement was the result of an understanding existing
between the leading members of the International in the
various parts of France ; but that the 'Jules Favres and
Gambettas, ' that vermine bourgeoise, as the International
called them, should obtain any share of power, was very
galling to the demagogues. At Lyons and Marseilles, however,
the supreme power fell into the hands of the lowest wretches.
The Commune installed at Lyons began its work by raising
the red flag — that of the International. At Paris the
association pretended at first to be most anxious to fight the
Prussians. When the battalions were sent to the front, however,
it was found that those comprising most Internationals were
the most ready ' to fall back in good order, ' or even to fly in
great disorder at the first alarm ; and General Clement
Thomas pointed out this instructive fact to the readers of the
Journal Officiel. But when a few Prussian regiments entered
Paris, the Internationa1, through its central committee,
announced that the moment for action was come ; and so the
members seized the cannons scattered in various parts of the
city,

496

OCCULT THEOCRASY

and then began that series of excesses, for which the
Commune will always enjoy an infamous notoriety. Its first
sanguinary act was the assassination of Generals Lecomte
and Clement Thomas. 6
" One would have supposed that the International would
disavow the Communists : but, on the contrary, it approved of
their proceedings. Flames were still ascending from the Hotel
de Ville when already numerous sections of the International
throughout Europe expressed their admiration of the conduct
of the Parisian outcasts.
" At Zurich, at a meeting of the members of the
International, it was declared that ' the struggle maintained by
the Commune of Paris was just and worthy, and that all
thinking men ought to join in the contest. ' "
Thus they agreed with Armand Levi and Jewish Masonry !
In 1872, another Jew, Karl Marx, transferred " the seat of
the General Council to New York, in care of his faithful
follower F. A. Sorge ", his co-religionist. 7 There the
organization
degenerated
into
a
gang
of
Anarchist-revolutionaries. In 1876 it was dissolved.
Numerous efforts to re-create the First International were
made by Marx assisted by Jules Guesde and in 1889 they
founded the Second International, the development of which
was retarded by internal dissensions. In 1905 however a
programme of unification, elaborated at Amsterdam, was
accepted by the contending factions. 8

THE KU-KLUX KLAN
(Founded 1865)
The Ku-Klux Klan was the name of an American secret
association formed by the Whites of the Southern States for
self protection after the Civil war.
It was started at 1865 at Pulaski, Tennessee, as a club for
young men. The period of organization of the K. K. K. lasted
from 1865 to 1868. It absorbed other societies of similar aims
such as the Knights of the White Camelia, the White
Brotherhood, the White League, the Pale Faces, Black
Cavalry, White Rose, etc.
Apart from the protection of whites, one of its chief aims
was opposition to a government based on negro suffrage such
as the North wanted to impose on the South.
The Klan denominated the entire South as the Invisible
Empire under the rule of a Grand Wizard : General N. B.
Forrest. Each state was a Realm under a Grand Dragon; each
county a Province under a Grand Giant, etc.
The avowed principles were the maintenance of peace and
order, of the laws of God, of the political and social
supremacy of the white race and also the prevention of the
intermingling of the races.

It showed strenuous opposition to the " scallawags " and "
carpet-baggers " as they called the Northern Whites who
incited the negroes to commit all kinds of depredations
against the Whites of the South.
In 1871 and 1872, the United States Congress enacted a
series of " Force Laws " to break the K. K. K. By that time
however the negro was once more subdued and the K. K. K.'s
central organization was disbanded.
Its spirit however survived and reasserted itself in 1915
when it was revived.

SOCIETAS ROSICRUCIANA IN ANGLIA
(Founded 1866)
For an historical sketch of the Societas Rosicruciana in
Anglia, the cover name for modern Illuminism, we can do no
better than turn to such an authority as its historian William
Wynn Westcott, erstwhile Supreme Magus of the Society.
The following items of information are gleaned from his
History of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, published in
1910. 1 The official statement of the aims of the Society reads
as follows :— " The aim of the Society is to afford mutual aid
and encouragement in working out the great problems of Life
and in searching out the secrets of Nature ; to facilitate the
study of the system of philosophy founded upon the Cabala
and the doctrines of Hermes Trismegistus, which was
inculcated by the original Fratres Rosae-Crucis of Germany,
A. D. 1450 ; and to investigate the meaning and symbolism of
all that now remains of the wisdom, art and literature of the
ancient world. "

" The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was founded in 1866
by Frater Robert Wentworth Little, an eminent Freemason
with much literary talent, and of great personal popularity. He
was Secretary of the Province of Middlesex, and Secretary of
the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls. He became the first
Supreme Magus and Master General of the College in 1867.
His knowledge and authority emanated from two sources, and
were supplemented by the learning and researches of several
other prominent students of occult philosophy. Brother
William Henry White, the Grand Secretary of England,
preserved certain Rosi-crucian papers2 which had ccme into
his possession on attaining office in 1810, at Freemason's Hall,
and ot these he made no use ; Brother Little fouud these
papers and used them. At the same time, and with the object
of re-constituting a Rosicrucian College in London, he
availed himself of certain knowledge and authority which
belonged to Brother Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, who had,
during a stay in Germany in earlier life, been in
communication with German Adepts who claimed a descent
from previous generations of Rosi-crucians. German Adepts
had admitted him to some grades of their system, and had
permitted him to attempt the formation of a group of Masonic
students in England, who under the Rosicrucian name might
form a partly esoteric society. With this license and with the
manuscripts of ritual information, which Brother White had
discovered in the vaults of Freemason's Hall, Fratres R. W.
Hughan, Woodman, O'Neal Haye, Irwin and some others, the
present English rituals were adopted, and have been in use
2. Part of these papers are presumed to be some of Nick
Stone's rituals.

SOCIETAS ROSICRUCIANA IN ANGLIA

with some modifications made by Dr. Woodman and his
successor, ever since the first regular meeting of the Society.
" The basic rule of the new Society stated that only Master
Masons of good standing and repute should be admitted to
membership, thus drawing a new distinction, of which we
have no previous record ; for earlier English Rosicrucian
Colleges had no Masonic basis, and some fraternities abroad
certainly admitted women on equal terms, of which fact there
is extant literary proof.
" See the curious document called ' The admission of
Sigismund Bacstrom, dated September 12th 1794 '. This will
be found reprinted in The Rosicrucian of October, 1876. The
only literary extant evidence of the source of our Rosicrucian
ritual from Brother W. H. White is contained in a letter in
possession of the Society. The share of Kenneth Mackenzie in
the origin of the Society depends at the present time on his
letters to Dr. Woodman and Dr. Westcott, and on his personal
conversations during the years 1876-1886 with
Dr.
Westcott.
" Fratres Hughan, Irwin, Hockley, Woodforde and
Benjamin Cox have also contributed their personal
knowledge on the subject.
" The original MSS. which Little possessed never came
into the possession of the S. M., the late Dr. Woodman, and so
were never received by the present Magus who has thus few
proofs in writing of the historic basis, which he lays down in
this sketch of the Society. The most natural conclusion is that
Little returned these papers to some obscure portion of the
records at Freemason's Hall, and that they are there still,
although the present officials have not traced them. This
explanation is very probable, because in September 1871, a
Brother

502

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Mathew Cooke raised a complaint in Grand Lodge against
Masonic officials for discovering, using and removing old
manuscripts from the record rooms of Freemason's Hall.
These papers supplied the basis for the reconstitution of the
Order of the Red Cross of Constantine, as well as of the
Rosicrucian Society. They were both Christian bodies, and
their records had been hidden away since the time of the
Grand Mastership of the Duke of Sussex, in 1813, who,
favouring the Unitarian doctrine, did all in his power to
remove Christian grades from notice.
" Our records include a letter from the Rev. T. F.
Ravenshaw, Grand Chaplain of England, one of the earliest
fratres of the Society, confirming much of the historic
information which the author received from Dr. Woodman,
Woodforde, Mackenzie and Irwin. This letter recites as
follows : — (I) that the first S. M. Frater R. M. Little
explained to him that the German Fraternity had an
established regulation which permitted distinguished
members to confer Rosicrucian grades in due order on
suitable persons. (II) That a certain Venetian Ambassador to
England in the last century had conferred Rosicrucian grades
and knowledge on Students in England; these in their turn had
handed on the rule and tradition to others, oi whom one of the
last survivors was Frater William Henry White, Grand
Secretary of English Freemasonry from 1810 to 1857 ; he
retired and lived until 1866. (Ill) From the papers he
possessed Frater White admitted Frater Robert Wentworth
Little. (IV) These papers came into Little's possession at
Freemason's Hall on Frater White's retirement from office.
(V)The rituals are mentioned as being imperfect for
ceremonial open use. "

offshoots : Golden Dawn, Stella Matutina and Ordo Templi
Orientis, etc. As to the organization of the Society, in order to
enable the reader to understand the system on which it

some of the articles governing its organization.
I. — That the meetings of the Society shall be held in
London at such house as the majority of the members shall
select, on the 2nd Thursdays in January, April, July and
October in each year, at such time and place as the majority
shall select. The first meeting in the year shall be considered
as the obligatory meeting and any member unable to attend on
that occasion or at the banquet meeting shall be required to
send a written excuse to the Secretary-General. Each brother
present at the banquet shall pay his quota towards the
expenses thereof.
III. — The Master-general and the Officers shall be
elected annually at the obligatory meeting and shall be
induced into their several offices on the same evening. The
Master-general shall then appoint the Assistant officers for
the year.
IV. — No brother shall be eligible for election to the
office of Master-general or Deputy Master-general unless he
shall have served one year as an Ancient, and have attained
the third Order; and no brother shall be eligible for the offices
of Treasurer-general, Secretary-general, or Ancient, unless he
be a member of the second Order.

In 1877, the order of membership was rearranged to
provide that in future, every College under the jurisdiction of
England would be restricted to 36 subscribing members
exclusive of members of the 9th grade : the only exception
being the Metropolitan College which was to be permitted to
enrol 72 members.
In The Rosicrucian the Society defines its aims in the
following terms :—
" The object of the society being purely literary and
antiquarian it is almost unnecessary to state that no
interference with, or opposition to, any rite of Freemasonry is
intended, or even tolerated : and it matters not to the members
whether the aspirant be a disciple of pure and ancient
Masonry, as interpreted by the Grand Lodge of England, or be
enthusiastic follower of those rites which embrace the Hauts
Grades, provided he be of good standing and possess
sufficient ability to take part in the peculiar objects of
research to which the society restricts itself — mystic and
Rosicrucian lore.

Scotland — in 1877.
In connection with the statement made at the opening of
this chapter that The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was
modern Illuminism, the reader's attention must be drawn to
the similarity of the grades of the modern Rosicrucian Society
with those of Weis-haupt's Bavarian Uluminism.
Much has been said and written by various and numerous
English authorities on the subject of English Grand Lodge
being in no wise connected with any outside societies,
whether exoteric or esoteric or with foreign or, as they call it,
" Continental " masonry.
We however submit the following suggestions as a logical
deduction from a close study of the organization, activities
and connections of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia.
English Grand. Lodge is today what it was intended to be at
the time of its creation, by disciples of avowed
Rosicrucianism, namely a dragnet or nursery. Under the guise
of philanthropy, humanitarianism, democratic ideals, and the
promise of material advancement, it attracts untold numbers
of unsuspecting men. The sifting takes place from the time of
their initiation. For those who are deemed useless to the
further secret aims of Masonry and therefore unworthy of
climbing from the Master's chair in Grand Lodge to The
Royal Arch degree, English Masonry will always remain what
it was represented to be when they became candidates for
initiation. They will be useful carriers of the legend that
English Masonry believes in God and philanthropy. But, like
Charity, English Grand Lodge covers a multitude of sins....
Above all, it covers Gnosticism under all its aspects ; it is in
fact its screen.

508

OCCULT THEOCRACY

It is a common error to believe that the Enghsn Grand
Lodge is an independent body which was formed in 1717.
Logical deduction will show that, owing to its formation
being the result of Rosicrucian effort, it always has been, and
still must be, subject to the direction of its esoteric parent
body, i. e. ROSICRUCIA-NISM or Manichean and Socinian
Gnosticism.
Childish as may be the claim of English Grand Lodge as to
its autonomy and independence, yet it has been most
successfully defended by scores of English writers who
attacked Masonic Societies and their subversive activities
against state and religion. According to them English Grand
Lodge was always exempted from such groups.
It is time to put an end to this legend. English Grand Lodge,
the body which claims to represent English Freemasonry, is
as much the child of Rosicrucianism today as it was in 1717
and has no more power or wish today to rebel against, or deny
its parent, than it had then. As to Esoteric Rosicrucianism,
this Esoteric body, mainly Cabalistic in its direction, always
has been and is in truth international. It has penetrated every
association, society or organization just as did the Illuminati
of Bavaria at the Wilhelmsbad convent of 1782.
In the particular Gnostic Rosicruciana in Anglia, briefly
sketched here, we see internationalism clearly depicted. At
one time it was personified in Kenneth Mackenzie who,
initiated and illuminized by the German Rosicrucian adepts,
was later the connecting link between German, English and
French Gnosticism, the latter represented at the time by
Eliphas Levi (A. L. Constant).
Nearer to our own time, William Wynn Westcott is the
connecting link of this international Rosicru-

SOCIETAS ROSICRUCIANA IN ANGLIA

cian-gnosticism. Prominent Grand Lodge and Royal Arch
Mason, he was also Supreme Magus of Rosicru-ciana in
Anglia and Knight Kadosch etc.
His connections with John Yarker, as also with the French
hermetist Papus and with the theosophist Blavatsky, were of
an esoteric kind, but most important of all were his close
relations with his brother Rosicrucian MacGregor Mathers
and the German Theodore Reuss. For it is, we know, William
Wynn Westcott, the respected English Grand Lodge and
Royal Arch Mason, Supreme Magus of Rosicru-ciana in
Anglia who, together with the Cabalist MacGregor Mathers,
created the Rosicrucian branch known as the Order of the
Golden Dawn. With Theodore Reuss he was closely
associated with the foundation of the Ordo Templi Orientis
which from Reuss and Karl Kellner's manuscripts is known to
be phallic.
How far the reciprocal conferring of degrees in their
respective orders between John Yarker, W. W. Westcott,
Theodore Reuss, Engel and Papus is a case of interpenetration
remains to be determined. John Yarker was the head of the
Ancient and Primitive Rite of the Rite of Swedenborg, etc.,
Wm. Wynn Westcott, the Supreme Magus of Rosicruciana in
Anglia, Theodore Reuss and Engel, heads of the German
Illuminati and Ordo Templi Orientis, and Papus, head of the
Martinists. We are fully aware of the Gnostic practices of
these different rites but the student bent on a certain type of
research will find interesting and instructive the study of the
political activities of the different bodies mentioned. The
author of Light Bearers of Darkness4 has attempted to

We reprint below two letters exchanged between William
Wynn Westcott and the German Theodore Reuss which show
the interlocking and international gnostic direction of those
two late honoured members of English Grand Lodge
Freemasonry.
It remains for the student to follow every line of enquiry to
the point of ccncentration where all threads are gathered and
systematically manipulated for the eventual destruction of
Christian civilization.
It may lead to the B'nai B'rith, the Universal Israelite
Alliance, India or Thibet, but in any case, a thorough and
complete study of Rosicrucianism embracing a minute one of
Rosicruciana in Anglia and its various branches will be a
great step taken in the direction of uncovering much of the

THE CLAN-NA-GAEL (V. C.)
(Founded 1869)
In his oft quoted book, The Secret Societies of Ireland,
Captain H. B. C. Pollard, late of the Staff of the Chief of
Police, Ireland, gives much valuable information concerning
the Clan-na-Gael (See page 69 et seq.).
" In 1869 a new secret Irish-American organization was
formed, known as the Clan-na-Gael. It traces its origin back
through a permanent secret society known as the Knights of
the Inner Circle, which, in turn, descended from the Knights
of St. Patrick, known as the Ancient Order of Hibernians
to-day. It was originally a seceding circle (The Brian Boru) of
the United Irishmen, an American society tracing back
to 1789. "
By 1873, the Clan had absorbed all independent Irish secret
societies save that of " The Irish Confederation " of Jeremiah
O'Donovan Rossa with which it had reached an arrangement
for mutual toleration.
" The original organizer of the Clan had called it the United
Brotherhood, and in all its work a simple letter cipher
composed of the next letter in the alphabet after the one really
meant, was utilised. The secret name of the Clan being the
United Brotherhood, it was therefore designated and spoken
of as the V. C.
513

514

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

Ireland was known as ' Jsfmboe, ' and so on. To this day the
Clan speaks and writes of the I. R. B. as the S. C.
" Up to 1881 the Clan-na-Gael was governed by an
executive body, the F. C, and had an annually elected
chairman. A Revolutionary Directory, the ' R. D. ' consisted of
seven members \.. Great secrecy shrouded the R. D. and the
names of members were only known to the delegates and
three ' Senior Guardians ' of each ' Camp ' of the Clan.
" These Lodges or ' Camps ' were known in cipher as ' D's ';
each had a number and an outward innocent name, such as the
Emmett Literary Association. The essential precaution for the
maintenance of secrecy was the rule that all documents, when
read, had to be burnt before the Brotherhood, a rule also
common to the I. R. B. of today. "
" An open Irish movement had been evolving in the States 2
and a great Irish Convention was held at Chicago in
November, 1881, where all kinds of Irish associations were to
be represented by delegates who would be addressed on the
subject of the Land League. By a clever political manoeuvre
the Clan secured the office of Chairman to one of its members,
the Rev. George Betts, and as he had the right of appointment
of all members of committees, they were enabled to nominate
a Clan-na-Gael majority and force the Clan views on the
whole body of the Convention.
" In 1882 the Clan, which had for long controlled the secret
organization in America, now also controlled all the various
open Irish societies and associations which had been
represented at the Convention. The mechanism of control was
simple — the whole influence
1. Pollard, The Secret Societies of Ireland, p. 71 et seq.
2. United States of America.

THE

CLAN-NA-GAEL

515

of the Clan was exerted to secure to their members a
preponderant representation as office-holders in these
associations, and it soon became recognised that membership
of the Clan was an indispensable preliminary to advancement
in local Irish affairs. 3
" The American Clan-na-Gael had concentrated all Irish
organizations, however innocuous, in the body of the National
League,4 and had, by controlling the Committee of the League
by its own members, thereby possessed itself not only of a
vast field from which to draw funds and recruits, but of the
whole co-ordinated political power of the Irish organizations
in America. The process developed by the I. R. B. in Ireland
was analogous ; through its members they were represented
on the Committees and Councils of practically every
organization which, in the opinion of its leaders, could be of
use to it. The identity of the I. R. B. men was always a secret.
" The secret power of the Brotherhood was brought to bear
on all questions of appointment to positions and offices in
various open associations, and it was its influence and
corruption which achieved those mysterious appointments to
position of persons singularly devoid of merit, which were,
and are, a marked feature of Irish life...
" In so far as the activist military policy of the I. R. B. was
concerned, the period from 1895 to 1912 was practically
negative.
" The I. R. B. had always held that membership of any
sectarian secret society, such as the A. 0. H., or the Orange
Society was incompatible with membership of the I. R. B.5

Howevei, the A. O. H. in America has for many years been
under the direct control of the Clan-na-Gael which also
influences through the A. 0. H. such American Catholic
Associations as are not distinctly Irish, such as the Knights of
Columbus, a Catholic Fraternal Society. "
In the year 1912 "the action of the North in arming had its
immediate repercussion in the South... On November 25th
1913 The Irish Volunteers, as distinct from the Ulster
Volunteers, had been formally instituted. "
" The outbreak of war introduced a new element in the
shape of an alliance between the I. R. B., the Clan-na-Gael,
and Germany. "
Casement, whose political activities were ruled by the two
Germans, Albert Ballin of the Hamburg-American line and
Professor Kuno Meyer, " had been active in the councils of the
Irish Volunteers and at the date of the outbreak of war was in
the United States on business connected with the relationship
between the I. R. B. and the Clan-na-Gael... On the 3rd Nov.
1914, he reached Berlin and laid before the German Foreign
Office the suggestion of alliance between the Irish
Republicans and Germany, and established a line of
communication via the American Clan-na-Gael with
revolutionary Ireland. From Berlin, he communicated with
Judge Cohalan and John Devoy, the Clan Leaders in the States,
who, in turn, maintained communication with the I. R. B. in
Ireland through emissaries and an established letter-carrying
service on craft crossing between Ireland and America. 6

representing the I. R. B. and the German Government

are amply set forth in such documents as the British
Government has yet disclosed, e. g. in the White Paper,
Documents relative to the Sinn Fein movement, published by
H. M. Stationery office in 1921. "
The Wolf von Igel papers, taken by the United States
Government at 60 Wall Street, New York, in April 1916,
further prove the complicity of the Clan-na-Gael. Casement
was captured when he landed from a German submarine on
the coast of Kerry, April 21, 1916.
The rebellion broke out in Dublin on Easter Monday, April
24, 1916 and on April 29 P. H. Pearse, the rebel leader,
President of the Provisional government, surrendered to
General Sir John Maxwell, and on the first of May the rebels
surrendered.
After the entry of the United States into the war in 1917,
the Irish-German headquarters were transferred to Spain,
operating from there via South America back to the
Clan-na-Gael.
" In 1921, on the 6th of December, the Irish representatives
and the Cabinet signed a Peace Treaty which gave Ireland the
status of a Dominion. "

John Yarker, in a pamphlet The Grand Mystic Temple,
states that in 1872 " we (the English) took from them (the
Americans) a Charter for its (The Ancient and Primitive Rite)
degrees 33-95 in and for Great Britain and Ireland and in the
Scottish Rite allied ourselves with the Supreme Grand
Council 33, (Cerneau) for the United States of America, of
which the writer (John Yarker) was made honorary 33°,
Representative of Amity. We had thus for long the Scottish
Rite allied with Mizraim, and now with Memphis. In the case
of the former, we established Representatives with various
Supreme Grand Councils and revised the Statutes of 1762, in
preference to the forged Constitution of 1786 in the year 1884;
in Mizraim with the old bodies of Naples and Paris ; and in
Memphis with America, Egypt, Roumania and various other
bodies working that Rite. We also, in these three Rites,
accepted foreign Charters to confirm our original powers. "
Yarker then makes the following apologia —

ANCIENT AND PRIMITIVE RITE

523

" Whatever may be the value assigned to Craft Masonry in
this country (England), a Master Mason is held in small
esteem abroad . . . Our object in giving our time at our own
cost to these degrees is to break with the unmasonic
exclusiveness bred of sycophancy and to give every reputable
Master Mason a chance of acquiring the high Masonic
initiation at a reasonable cost. 1
Neophytes upon entering a Chapter received the 18th
degree of the Ancient and Accepted Rites (Rose Croix) and
Ancient and Primitive Rites and 46th of Mizraim. Advanced
in a Senate, these receive the 30th of the two Rites and the
66th of Mizraim. In the series of the Council they receive the
higher and more important occult grades of Mizraim and
Memphis or Ancient and Primitive Masonry.
" The governing body or ' Sovereign-Sanctuary Supreme
Grand Council of Rites 33-95 has already issued Charters for
Grand Mystic Temples, Council General (of Rites) 32-94, for
England, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand and West Africa
and each Charter covers a Grand Consistory 32-93, Ancient

also established a Sovereign body with like powers for the
German Empire. 2
" The Constitution of the A. and P. Rite declares ' that Great
Britain and Ireland derives from the Sovereign Sanctuary for
the American Continent, which again derives its authority
from the Sovereign Sanctuary of France, the College of Rites
and the Grand Orient of France '. In America authority was

ANARCHISTS

(Founded 1872)

Anarchists claim direct descent from Diderot and those
factions which during the French Revolution of 1789 had
formed the clubs of the Enrages and Hebertistes. Prudhon
was their prototype.
Chronologically speaking, however, the Anarchist party
was formed on Sept. 29, 1872, when a split occurred in the
ranks of the participants in the Hague Congress of the
International Association of Workers, numbers siding with
Bakunin whilst others rallied round Karl Marx.
Bakunin's adherents formed the Anarchist party and
organized in Switzerland the " Federation Juras-sienne "
which soon extended its ramifications to Northern Italy,
Eastern France and Spain. The Federation's tenets were
plainly anarchistic, urging terrorism as the means of
overthrowing all forms of existing governments. The attempt
of Haedel on the life of the German Emperor Wilhelm in 1878,
as well as the murder of the Tzar Alexander II of Russia, 1882,
were engineered by anarchists. From Europe, their activities
spread to the United States of America when Most, the
German anarchist, founder of the Freiheit, went

of Colonel Peter Hahn and granddaughter of General Alexis
Hahn von Rottenstern Hahn, of Mecklenburg, Germany,
settled in Russia. When very young, she married Niciphore
Blavatsky, Councillor of State, from whom she separated
after three months.
As regards the founder of this order, Rene Guenon, who
has made a close study of Theosophy, thus briefly sketches
her career.
" Mme. Blavatsky's extraordinary life of adventure started
in 1848. During her travels in. Asia Minor with her friend
Countess Kiseleff, she met a Copt (some say a Chaldean)
called Paulos Metamon, who claimed to be a magician, and
who seems to have been a fairly accomplished conjurer. She
continued her travels with this personage with whom she
went to Greece and Egypt till her funds gave out, when she
returned to Europe. " l

Having quarrelled with her family, she was unable to go to
Russia so she went to London where she frequented spiritistic
and revolutionary circles. She was initiated into the Carbonari
by Mazzini in 1856 and was also an initiate of the Order of the
Druses, according to John Yarker.
About this period, (1856) her Mahatma Morya is supposed
first to have manifested. The Mahat-mas Morya and Koot
Hoomi are said to be members of the highest degree of "The
Great White Lodge ", that is to say of the occult Hierarchy
which, according to the theosophists, secretly governs the
world.
Guenon thus continues : 2
" Towards 1858, Madame Blavatsky decided to return to
Russia; she became reconciled with her father, staying with
him till 1863 when she went to the Caucasus and met her
husband. A little later she was in Italy whither she seemed to
have been summoned by a Car-bonarist order; in 1866, she
was with Garibaldi, whom she accompanied during his
expeditions, she fought at Viterbo, then at Mentana, where
she was seriously wounded and left on the field as dead ; she
recovered however and went to Paris for her convalescence.
There she remained some time under the influence of a certain Victor Michal, a spiritist-magnetizer. This Michal, a
journalist, was a Freemason as was also his friend Rivail
(alias Allan Kardec) once founder, later director of the
Folies-Marigny and the pioneer of French spiritism. It was
Michal who developed the medium-istic faculties of Madame
Blavatsky... Madame Blavatsky was, at that time, herself a
believer in spiritism and claimed to belong to the school of
Allan Kardec, from whom she preserved certain

ideas, notably those concerning reincarnation. "
In 1867, she succeeded after three previous attempts in
entering Tibet.
" Inquire Within ", who acknowledges Guenon as her
source of information and who has also closely followed the
activities of Madame Blavatsky during this period of her life,
refers to her visit to America in the following terms :
" In 1875 Madame Blavatsky was sent from Paris to
America where she met Henry Steel Olcott and where on
October 20, 1875, a society, said to be for ' spiritualist
investigations ', was founded in New York.
" Olcott was President, Felt and Dr. Seth Pancoast
vice-presidents, and Madame Blavatsky Secretary. Among
other members were William Q. Judge, Charles Sothern, one
of the high dignitaries of American Masonry, also for a short
time General Albert Pike, Grand Master of the Scottish Rite
for the Southern Jurisdiction U. S. A., who was said to be the
author of the thirty-three degrees received from the Arabian
member of the ' Great School. ' ". 3
To anyone who has read Part 1 of this book the significance
of this connection with Pike and Luci-ferianism at this period
requires no further comment!
Guenon, detailing this American visit of Madame
Blavatsky, further explains how " George H. Felt, self-styled
Professor of Mathematics and Egyptologist, had been
introduced to Madame Blavatsky by a journalist called
Stevens. Felt was a member of a secret society generally
called by the initials ' H. B. of L. ' (Hermetic Brotherhood of
Luxor). This society, which played a prominent part in the
first stages of spiritistic phenomena in America, is
definitely opposed
3. " Inquire Within ", Light-bearers of Darkness, p. 26.

to spiritistic theories, for it teaches that these phenomena are
due, not to the spirits of the dead, but to certain forces
directed by living men. " 4
Madame Blavatsky and Olcott had both joined this society
from which they were expelled before they left America.
A letter from John Yarker quoted in Freemasonry
Universal (Vol V, part 2 Autumn Equinox, 1929) is
here relevant. It states that Madame Blavatsky's
masonic certificate in the Ancient and Primitive Rite
of Masonry was issued in the year 1877.
Yarker writes " Both the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim,
as well as the Grand Orient of France, possessed a Branch of
Adoptive Masonry, popular in France in the 18th century and
of which, in later years, the Duchess of Bourbon held the
Rank of Grand Mistress.
" We accordingly sent H. P. B., on the 24/11/77, a
Certificate of the highest rank, that of a Crowned Princess 12,
said to have been instituted at Saxe in the last quarter of the
18th century. "
" In November, 1878 ", according to ' Inquire Within', "
Madame Blavatsky and Olcott left for India, and in 1882
founded the Theosophical centre in Adyar, near Madras ;
there she initiated her ' esoteric section ', and contacted the
so-called ' Mahatmas ', and her phantastic phenomena,
precipitated letters, astral bells, materialisations, etc., were in
time suspected and exposed. The matter was taken up by the '
Society for Psychical Research ', which in December, 1885,
reported her as ' one of the most accomplished, most
ingenious, and most interesting impostors. '5

THEOSOPHICAL

SOCIETY

533

" Mrs. Besant was presented to Madame B!a-vatsky in
1889 by the socialist Herbert Burrows, also member of the
Stella Matutina, and she immediately succumbed to Madame
Blavatsky's irresistible magnetism and formidable power of
suggestion. Madame Bla-vatsky died in London May 8, 1891.
Mrs. Besant was elected President in 1907. From 1910 to its
consummation one of her chief works, assisted by Leadbeater,
was to train Krishnamurti as Messiah, or as he preferred to be
called, ' World Teacher '. On February 19, 1922, an alliance
between Mrs. Besant's Co-masonry and the Grand Orient of
France was celebrated at the Grand Temple of the Droit
Humain in Paris. "
The Society has over seven hundred affiliated sects at
present. " Its objects are, The World Religion, The World
University, and the World Government (by the Restoration of
the Mysteries, i. e. by the recognition of their place as the
World Government as they were recognized in ancient days,
the place they have ever continued to occupy...). " 6
The political status of this organization as a centralizing
point for numerous secret and theocratic orders is evidenced
by a letter dated July 1, 1926, from 171 Palace Chambers,
Westminster, London, according to which the Editors and
Correspondents of the English Information Service, to which
was given the name of " The Theosophical News Bureau ",

In 1887, when Madame Blavatsky settled in London, she
had started a Theosophical magazine called Lucifer the
light-bringer and published her Secret Doctrine. She is the
authoress of another well known work Ms unveiled.
In the year 1889, Mr. MacGregor Mathers, 8th degree
Rosicruciana in Anglia, wrote a letter to the editor of Lucifer
in which he stated that the Theosophical and Rosicrucian
Societies entertained very friendly relations 8 and this idea of "
friendly foreign relations " is further confirmed by Rene
Guenon who writes : " There are persons who believe that the
' Esoteric Section ' exists no longer in the Theosophical
Society, but that is not so ; the truth is that, to defeat curiosity,
it has been made into a nominally separate organization but
one nevertheless, under the same direction ".
The religious principles of The Theosophical Society are
gnostic and anti-christian and are the same as those of " The
Hermetic Society ".
Numerous were the dissensions and many were the
" Each one of these adaptations being applicable to the
physical or spiritual world, one understands how real '
Illumines ' can draw towards the light of truth, towards this '
light which illuminates all men coming into this world ', towards
the divine living voice, the profanes called to initiation.
But for that it was necessary that the fundamental and
hermetic key of the degrees and their adaptation should be
conserved by an occult university. Such was the role that the
Rose-Croix and the judeo-christians had reserved to themselves. "

Known as the Rite of Primitive and Original Phremasons,
The Supreme Grand Lodge and Temple of the

the Supreme Council of the Phremasons in Canada (founded
by the Golden Square Body of London) which was composed
of the following well-known Brethren :

The rite has six degrees, the craft degrees and three others,
namely, Enlightened Prince or Green Brother, Sublime Prince or

The Rosicrucian and Grail grades form the apotheosis of the
entire system.
Bro. John Yarker tells us (see page 416 in The Equinox, March
1912) that Samuel Beswick informed him that in his book, the
matter added by Chastanier had been rejected and " that what was
left was the work of Swedenborg. Hence", continues Bro. Yarker,
"Bro. Waite's description of two secret and unnamed degrees, are of

THE RUSSELLITES
OR THE INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS

(Founded 1879)
The International Bible Student Movement was founded by
Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916) with the object chiefly of
attracting the lower middle class intelligentsia of Christian
communities such as certain clerical workers, teachers,
servants and persons not accessible to direct forms of
propaganda. In America the movement has had great
influence among the negro element.
In 1879 Russell founded The Watch Tower of which he
was the sole editor.
The Russellite teaching, drawing its own arbitrary
conclusions and proclaiming them as final, professes to prove
from Biblical sources that all Christian churches are evil and
corrupt, that the time of the Gentiles ended in 1914, and that
the Jews must henceforth reign supreme over the world. It
also elaborates an occult dogma alleged to be based on
biblical precedents.
It condemns the Roman Catholic Church, referring to
Rome in true esoteric Masonic style as Babylon and disposes
of the Pope and his entire hierarchy as agents of the Antichrist
who are doomed to extinction according to the familiar
Masonic formulas of Albert Pike, Mazzini and Co. We are
further told on biblical autho539

rity, interpreting the following words in Rev. II. 24 " As they
speak " that this means that " Satan is a name applicable to
Rome as describing its characteristics. 1
The Protestant Episcopal and other Christian churches
which in Russell's graphic language are " the Harlot daughters
of the Romish Church " and " have committed fornication "
which term he interprets as meaning the union of Church and
State, so bitterly opposed by the Jews in all countries, fare no
better at the pen of this prolific writer, who predicts that,
under the visible rulership of the Ancient Worthies (The
Jewish Sanhe-drin), those Gentiles who still believe in Christ
will acknowledge his reign as an invisible one while submitting as Christians to all the hardships these Jewish lords
might choose to put upon them.
Brother Russell gives us little hope for the time of
tribulation which is upon us, for on page 122 of The Finished
Mystery he wrecks any hopes we might still cherish with
regard to benevolent brotherhoods in the following sentence
— " As the trouble increases, men will seek, but in vain, for
protection in the great rocks and fortresses of society
(Freemasonry, Oddfellowship, and Trades Unions, Guilds,
Trusts and all societies secular and ecclesiastical) and in the
mountains (governments) of the earth ".
The publications of The International Bible Students
Association are interesting samples of political propaganda
and seem well calculated to suppress possible instincts of
revolt among such members of the Christian community as
might object to the role allotted to them under the Jewish
Super State.
The present head of this movement is John Rutherford.

GRAND LAMAISTIC ORDER OF LIGHT
(FRATRES LUCIS)

(Founded 1882)

This order, Fratres Lucis, was founded in 1882. by an
English Jew called Maurice Vidal Portman, an orientalist and
a politician who in 1876 was in close contact with Lord
Lytton, then Viceroy of India, the author of the well known
occult novel Zanoni.
As regards this order, John Yarker, recipient of The Crown
of Kether, gives us the following information :
" The Altar is that of Maha Deva and had a ritual of three
degrees — Novice, Aspirant, Viator. The writer (John Yarker)
arranged with Bro. Portman to amalgamate it with the Sat
Bhai, Rite of Perfection, but it seems to be continued
separately at Bradford, Yorkshire, as the ' Oriental Order of
Light '. Its early certificate adopted the forms of the Cabala,
with which the Theo-sophy of India has some affinity. In the
East, ceremonial degrees are not valued, the object being the
development of practical occultism, which was the purpose of
the establishment of the Order of Light, governed by a Grand
Master of the Sacred Crown or Kether of

the Cabala. The writer (John Yarker) has a letter from Bro.
Portman in which he says ; ' the Sat Bhai rituals are without
exception the finest and best suited to an occult order of
anything I have ever read ' and he leaves all arrangements in
the writer's hands. " 2
If, as John Yarker says, the Altar is indeed that of Maha
Deva, we refer the reader to that part of this book where the
Indian cult of Siva (The Destroyer, Maha Deva) is outlined.
The present headquarters of the order are still at Bradford,
Yorkshire.

THE AHMADIYYAH SECT
(Founded 1882)
The ahmadiyyah sect is described in an article by Fr.
Lawrence as having been founded in 1882 at Quadiam,
Punjab, by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who died in 1908. It
resembles in many ways Bahaism and attempts to conciliate
the oriental and occidental religions while its dogma, based
on the shi'a (unorthodox Mahometan) foundation of free
thought, embraces the buddhist belief, rites and
metempsychosis as well as the idea of the occult Messiah.
In accordance with the Ismali theory of the advent of the
reincarnated mahdi at the opening of each century, this sect
proclaims their founder to have been the reincarnation of
Christ for the XIV Century (XX of our era) and the harbinger
of the future Messiah.
An Indian branch of the sect endorses a legend according
to which Christ, having escaped the Pharisees, died at
Srinagar, Kashmir. At this place is the tomb of an obscure
buddhist saint Yus-asaf.
The propaganda of the sect is worked from two centres, one
at Lahore, India, and the other at Woking, England, the latter
being chiefly political in character adhering to the kemalist
and panturanic programme.

CO-MASONRY
(ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITES)
SOVEREIGN GRAND MASTER, ELECTED 1929,
THE VERY ILLUSTRIOUS BROTHER LUCIEN LEVI 33°.

(Founded 1892)

We quote the following from a pamphlet issued under the
sanction of the Deputy of the Supreme Council of Universal
Co-Masonry for Great Britain and its Dependencies by the
Grand Secretary of the said Jurisdiction.
" In the system of the Grand Orient of France the Craft
lodges are under the control of the Supreme Council of the
highest degree of the rite. The first attempt to found mixed
lodges in France was made in 1774. These adoptive lodges
spread to other countries, but the modern Co-Masonic Order
or, L'Ordre Magonnique Mixte International Was founded in
1882. It consisted of a group of Lodges which united under the
name of La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France,
received immediate recognition from the Grand Orient of
France.
" In 1872 the Lodge Le Droit Humain was founded by
Mademoiselle Maria Deraismes in the presence of Dr.
Georges Martin, a prominent mason.
547

548

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

" In 1900 the new Grande Loge Symbolique amended its
policy so as to enable it to extend its ramifications to other
countries and to work the higher degrees. Aided by Brethren
in possession of the 33rd degree, the body was then raised
from a Craft Grand Lodge to a Supreme Council of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites. Madame Marie Martin,
the close friend and collaborator of Mademoiselle Deraismes,
succeeded upon the death of the latter to the leadership of the
movement, (Dr. Georges Martin holding the Office of Grand
Orateur) and held it till her death in 1914.
" There are Co-Masonic lodges in France, Belgium,
England, Scotland, India, Australia, South Africa, America,
Holland, Java, Switzerland and Norway.
" The first English Co-Masonic Lodge was consecrated in
London on Sept. 26th 1902 by the Grand Officers of the
Supreme Council under the title of Human Duty, No. 6, and
Mrs. Annie Besant was created Vice-President Grand Master
of the Supreme Council and Deputy for Great Britain and its
Dependencies.
" The Grand Lodge of England does not recognize this
particular body of Masonry (1927) but Universal Co-Masonry
recognises and admits to its lodges Masons of all regularly
constituted Masonic orders. Its laws and regulations are based
on the principles adopted by the Universal Assembly of
Supreme Councils gathered together at Lausanne on Sept.
22nd, 1875. "
Much of the real information bearing upon the position of
woman in Masonry has been omitted by Masonic writers and
the reader would be well advised to refer for it to Vol I.
In The Hidden Life in Freemasonry (p. 191) C. W.
Leadbeater 33° gives us the following cryptic description of
the preparation of the Candidate for Initiation

CO-MASONRY

549

into the degree of Apprentice in the Co-masonic order :
"Before his admission he is divested of all m...s and v...s, is
h...d, and has his r... a..., ]... b... and 1... k... b..., and his r... h...
s...d. "
" In plain English the foregoing would read : Before his
admission he is divested of all metals and valuables, is
hoodwinked and has his right arm, left breast and left knee
bared and his right heel slip shod. "
The candidate thus prepared is saturated with magnetic
energy during the ensuing ceremony from which
consequently he or she issues already under hypnotic
influence.
These hypnotic bonds are further strengthened during the
ensuing ceremonies of Apprentice and Master Mason which
however, in this order, according to Mr. Leadbeater's
description of elementals, undines and other sprites, seem to
emulate very closely the phenomena of the Spiritualist's
seance room.
After attainment by the Candidate to the third degree the
Kundalini is supposed to be fully developed.

KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
(Founded 1882)
The Knights of Columbus is the name of a Roman Catholic
organization founded in 1882, in the United States of
America, by a Roman Catholic priest, Father P. McGivney of
New Haven, Connecticut.
From the Roman Catholic paper, La Croix, of Paris, in the
number dated December 20, 1913, we gather that, at that date,
the Knights of Columbus wielded an immense power with
which public authorities had to reckon. Their number then
was acknowledged to be more than three hundred thousand.
The Order had four degrees and was headed by a Grand
Master, six pro-Grand Masters and a General Secretary. The
territory of the United States was divided into six provinces,
each province administered by one of the six pro-Grand
Masters. Each province was in turn subdivided in districts
administered by a Master of the 4th degree and appointed by
the Grand Masters for a period of two years. Districts were
subdivided in councils or chapters.
The Verite of Quebec, a Canadian paper, in August 1913,
put the number of the councils at 1630. At that time, the
Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus was composed
of James O'Flaherty, Martin H. Carmody,
550

KNIGHTS

OF COLUMBUS

551

William J. McGinley, Daniel J. Callahan and Joseph C.
Pelletier.
The order of the Knights of Columbus was the cause of
much perturbation in the Roman Catholic Church.
Under cover of being an association for mutual help, it had
recruited a considerable number of members whc believed
that the Order was fully approved by the Church authorities.
When however its activities took on the appearance of a
Masonic society with initiation rituals, symbolism and secret
oaths, many among the Catholic Clergy became alarmed.
Their fears were not allayed when it was known that the
leaders of the Knights of Columbus were having fraternal
exchanges of all kinds with the Oddfellows, Templars and
other Masonic bodies. The climax was reached when it was
rumoured that in Rome, the Knights of Columbus had
petitioned the Pope to allow their members to become, at least
in the United States, regular Masons.
The Knights of Columbus, like the Oddfellows, formed
lodges of adoption in 1913, women being enrolled under the
caption of " Daughters of Isabella ". Women lodges were
called " courts ". In 1913, the number of " courts " was over
200 and the membership of " Daughters of Isabella " over two
hundred thousand.
Like the society of Oddfellows and similarly to the O. T. O.
of the Rosicrucians the Knights of Columbus hold much
power over the property and various interests of their
members.
Due to their efforts in the direction of establishing a
universal religion and inter-confessionalism, the Knights of
Columbus have been considered by a large section of the
Roman Catholic clergy as an element having departed from
the teachings of the Church of Rome and whose secret aim is
to bore from within and disintegrate the Roman Catholic
power.

552

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Although the Knights of Columbus and the Daughters of
Isabella have extended their ramifications into the United
Kingdom, it is in the United States that their strength mainly
resides. This is easily understood when one studies the
activities of Roman Catholics in America and realises that,
there, they are far more a political entity with subversive
tendencies than a religious body.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
(Founded 1883)
Christian Science was founded in 1883.
Mary Baker Eddy, the founder, was born in 1821 at Bow,
New Hampshire, U. S. A. and died in 1910.
Having suffered greatly all her life from neurasthenia and
hysteria she developed mediumship at an early age. Spiritistic
sessions further revealed her psychic gifts but it is more than
likely that her early years of experimental psychic research
exposed her, in after years, to the horrors of what she later
described as " Malicious Animal Magnetism ", familiarly
referred to by her students as M. A. M.
At the age of 22, she married George Washington Glover, a
Freemason and Oddfellow, who took her to live at Charleston,
South Carolina, six months later. However he contracted
yellow fever while at Wilmington where he died in June 1844.
In 1853, she married Daniel Patterson, a medical
practitioner, from whom she was later separated.
In October 1862 she applied for medical assistance to
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (d. 1866) a healer, who had many
marvellous cures to his credit. His medical system was based
on an understanding of the scientific laws
553

554

OCCULT THEOCRASY

governing the use of hypnotism, mesmerism and suggestion.
It is claimed that she derived her system from him.
Her book Science and Health was first published in 1875.
In 1877 she married Asa Gilbert Eddy who left her a
widow in 1882.
In 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical
College in Boston and two years later, when the movement
was well established, started publishing the Christian
Science Journal.
On June 13, 1888, the National Christian Science
Association held its second annual meeting at Central Music
Hall, Chicago. This had been organized as well as advertised
by George B. Day, Pastor of the First Church of Christ
Scientists, Chicago, and the speech delivered by Mrs. Eddy
on the second day of this session was acclaimed by her 4,000
listeners as an inspired oration. In view of the extraordinary
pitch of enthusiasm attained by her audience and knowing the
practice of " charging" public rooms or halls one is led to ask
oneself the question as to whether the assembly hall had been
specially "charged" for that particular meeting. Whether Mrs.
Eddy herself, like the Sybils of ancient times, was also "
inspired" by outside hypnotic influence is another hypothesis
to conjure with.
From then on, Mrs. Eddy's religious future was assured.
Under her leadership suggestion became indeed the
foundation of a religion, a religion in which psychic force,
operating under suggestion, accomplishes definite physical
results.
Mrs. Eddy's acquaintance with Mrs. Augusta Stetson,
another Christian Science leader, had already taken place for,
according to E. F. Dakin, author of Mrs. Eddy {page 178) "it
was at a meeting in a fashionable home on

Stetson, in 1884... She (Mrs. Stetson) had been born of old
Puritan stock in Waldoboro, Maine, about 1842. In after life
she shrouded her past in mystery, refused -to tell her age, and
the town records were eventually burned. She grew up as one
of five children in a house which her father, Peabody Simmons,
carpenter, built with his own hands. When the family moved
to another Maine town, Damariscotta, Augusta was organist
there in the Methodist church and a singer in the choir. At 24
she married a ship-builder, Frederick Stetson, who was
partially an invalid as a result of imprisonment in Libby Prison
during the Civil War. As his wife, she went to England where
he secured employment with a British shipbuilding firm. Later,
he was sent to Bombay, and here she had an opportunity to
delve into a subject in which she had an instinctive interest —
the oriental philosophies. In these philosophies affirmation
and denial play an important role, and a pantheistic God is
postulated — a God who is the Universe, whose mind is All,
and of whose mind matter, like force, is but one manifestation
or expression in the midst of many. "
Mrs. Stetson started healing and teaching Mrs. Eddy's
system in New York in 1886, later resigning her connection
with the Christian Science church in 1909.
One can almost describe this system as emerging clearly
out of the realm of occultism, a kind of suggestion or
auto-suggestion, whereby practical beneficial results may be
induced in a patient by the application of certain occult laws
to their personal medical requirements.
Mrs. Eddy's dogma is summed up by Hudson in the
following words :
" Matter has no existence. Our bodies are composed of
matter, therefore our bodies have no existence.

556

OCCULT THEOCRASY

" It follows of course that disease cannot exist in a
non-existent body. " 1
However, regardless of this paradox and the various
opinions hitherto expressed about Christian Science, we
recognize, while admitting the efficacy of Mrs. Eddy's use of
the force of beneficent animal magnetism, that her personal
fear of the action of Malicious Animal Magnetism, so derided
by her theological adversaries, is logical and founded.
These forces operate on sound scientific lines and those
who can use the power of suggestion to gain ascendency over
a sick person may use it again later for other motives. The
danger of such misapplication is not one to be disregarded in
calling in a healer, whatever Mrs. Eddy's detractors may say !
That danger is real and every student of the occult knows it.
The movement has become popular and has a following
among people of wealth who seem to become the easy prey of
occultists and charlatans.
The following extract from the Daily Telegraph of Deer.

THE FABIAN SOCIETY
(Founded 1883)
The nominal founder of The Fabian Society was Thomas
Davidson, an idealist who, in the hope of bettering the lot of
humanity, organized a debating club the original aim of
which was, according to Mr. Pease, author of The History of
the Fabian Society, " the reconstruction of society on a
non-competitive basis with the object of remedying the evils
of poverty. " l
This non-competitive basis meant maintenance for all by
the community as a right, regardless of merit.
The club met fortnightly in the drawing rooms of its
various members and in 1884 adopted the name "The Fabian
Society".
Among those prominent in the movement in its early days
were : Frank Podmore, a spiritualist, Percival Chubb, a clerk
on the Local Government Board, Edward Pease, Hubert
Bland, J. Ramsay Macdonald, later Prime Minister of
England, R. B. Haldane, afterwards Lord Haldane, George
Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, afterwards Lord Passfield,
Graham Wallas, William Clarke, a former disciple of Mazzini,
Mrs. Annie Besant, then a radical with an office at 63, Fleet
Street, who

controlled The Freethought Publishing Co., Dr. Pank-hurst,
husband of the later leader of the Women's Social and Political
Union and Mrs. Charlotte M. Wilson who, while retaining her
membership in the Fabian Society " devoted herself ", so we are told
by Mr. Pease, to the Anarchist movement led by Prince Kropotkin
and for some years edited the anarchist paper Freedom. On page 68
of The History of the Fabian Society by Edward R. Pease we read :
" In order to avoid a breach with Mrs. Wilson and her Fabian
sympathisers, it was resolved to form a Fabian Parliamentary
League, which Fabians could join or not as they pleased ; its
constitution, dated February, 1887, is given in full in Tract No. 41 ;
here it is only necessary to quote one passage which describes the
policy of the League and of the Society, a policy of deliberate
possibilism :—
" The League will take active part in all general and local
elections. Until a fitting opportunity arises for putting forward
Socialist candidates to form the nucleus of a Socialist party in
Parliament, it will confine itself to supporting those candidates who
will go furthest in the direction of Socialism. It will not ally itself
absolutely with any political party; it Will jealously avoid being
made use of for party purposes ; and it will be guided in its action by
the character, record and pledges of the candidates before the
constituencies. In Municipal, School Board, Vestry, and other local
elections, the League will, as it finds itself strong enough, run
candidates of its own, and by placing trustworthy Socialists on local
representative bodies it will endeavour to-secure the recognition of
the Socialist principle in all the details of local government. "...
" The League first faded into a Political Committee of the Society,
and then merged silently and painlessly into the general body. "
The foregoing is interesting : first, — as showing the original
Anarchist connection with Fabian Socialism

THE

FABIAN

SOCIETY

559

as we now know it, secondly, — as an example of one of the
most usual methods of subverting an existing organization.
An offshoot of the existing organization was here formed,
pledged to a policy or policies which might have been
repudiated by the parent body. This offshoot being destined to
eventual reabsorption into the parent body could thus assure
the successful " boring from within " of the old organization.
We are further told by Mr. Pease that in 1888, " a
Universities Committee, with Frank Podmore as Secretary for
Oxford and G. W. Johnson for Cambridge, had begun the '
permeation ' of the Universities, which has always been an
important part of the propaganda of the Society ".
By 1890, the support of a splendidly organized intelligentsia was assured to the socialist cause with the Fabian
Society as its propaganda centre and a number of local Fabian
societies were formed. They were succeeded by and merged
into branches of the Independent Labour Party.
On page 209 of Mr. Pease's book, we glean some more
enlightening information which definitely connects the
Fabians with the Jew-captured organization of the old
International
" The International Socialist and Trade Union Congresses,
held at intervals of three or four years since 1889, were at first
no more than isolated Congresses, arranged by local
organizations constituted for the purpose in the preceding year.
Each nation voted as one, or at most, as two units, and
therefore no limit was placed on the number of delegates ; the
one delegate from Argentina or Japan consequently held equal
voting power to the scores or even hundreds from France or
Germany. But gradually the organization was tightened up,
and in 1907 a scheme was adopted

560

OCCULT THEOCRASY

which gave twenty votes each to the leading nations, and
proportionately fewer to the others. Moreover a permanent
Bureau was established at Brussels, with Emile Vandervelde,
the distinguished leader of the Belgian Socialists, later well
known in England as the Ministerial representative of the
Belgian Government during the war, as Chairman. In England,
where the Socialist and Trade Union forces were divided, it
was necessary to constitute a special joint committee in order
to raise the British quota of the cost of the Bureau, and to elect
and instruct the British delegates. It was decided by the
Brussels Bureau that the 20 British votes should be allotted ;
10 to the Labour Party, 4 to the I. L. P. (Independent Labour
Party) 4 to the British Socialist Party, into which the old S. D.
F. (Socialist Democratic Federation) had merged, and 2 to the
Fabian Society, and the British Section of the International
Socialist Bureau was, and still remains, constituted financially
and electorally on that basis. "
In the same chapter of his history, Mr. Pease explains that "
half of two-thirds of the Fabians belonged also to the I. L. P.
and nearly all the I. L. P. leaders were or had been members of
the Fabian Society ". The I. L. P. was founded in January
1893 by Keir Hardie and Fried-rich Engels, the disciple of
Karl Marx.
This Independent Labour Party virtually took over the
active political work of the Fabian Society, leaving to the
parent body its literary and propaganda status.
At a conference at Leeds in 1899 it was resolved to form a
Local Government Information Bureau, to be jointly managed
by the I. L. P. and the Fabian Society.
In 1904, Sidney Webb became chairman of the Technical
Education Board which up to that date directed all higher
education for England. This event, and the concerted working
of a group of Fabians within the London County Council,
considerably enhanced the

THE FABIAN

SOCIETY

561

opportunities for further socialistic expansion of the
Society.
It should be borne in mind that Anarchists and Socialists,
while seeming to differ in their social Utopian policies, agree
on the first step necessary to provoke an economic condition
which would enable them to reorganize the world to their
liking.
This first step is the destruction of present day civilisation,
the good with the bad.
Their aim of Destruction is the same, only the method
whereby it is to be effected differs. This effort at destruction
accounts for the community of action of Socialists and
Anarchists throughout history.
According to the Anarchists : All must be destroyed in
order that all may be rebuilt, but, according to the Socialists,
the present system will fall of itself by the passage of certain
measures into law. These laws, while framed to appeal to
popular fancy, once introduced, can be administered in such a
way as to operate the International Destruction which is the
primary aim of both parties.
Writing of Babeuf and Buonarotti and their abortive
conspiracy of 1796, Professor H. J. Laski in The Socialist
Tradition in the French Revolution states that " the strategy
they (the Babouvists) invented has provided ever since the
methodology of revolutionary socialism at least in its large
outline ".
The Fabians form numerous detached societies,
committees, study clubs, associations, leagues, schools and
what not, in order to gain the support of non-socialists for
such sections of the Socialist programme which might fail to
receive public approbation if the connection with the World
Socialist-Communist scheme was revealed. Thus the " sucker
lists " of capitalistic supporters of socialism are made
available

562

OCCULT THEOCRASY

for England. The system is the same in America.
Among the societies which owe their origin to Fabian
initiative may be mentioned :
The London School of Economics, founded 1895.
The Fabian Research, founded 1912, later known as the
Labour Research Bureau.
The Pan-Fabian Organization, founded 1907.
The University Socialist Federation, founded 1912, later
known as University Labour Clubs.
The Labour Representation Committee, founded 1900,
known after 1906 as The Labour Party.
Among the members of the Fabian Association during the
last 30 years we find the following names : Bertrand Russell
(now Earl Russell), Professor H. J. Laski, Mrs. Sidney Webb
(now Lady Passfield), H. G. Wells (resigned), F. W.
Pethick-Lawrence, George Lansbury, Philip Snowden
(ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Privy Seal) and
Mrs Snowden (now Viscount and Viscountess Snowden),
Will Crooks, Sir Sidney Olivier (ex-Secretary of State for
India, now Lord Olivier), the late Brig.-Gen. C. B. Thomson
(subsequently Lord Thomson, late Secretary of State for Air),
Arthur Henderson (ex-Home Secretary) and Noel Buxton.
It is rather interesting to note how many Fabians have
found their way to the House of Lords.
Mr. Pease remarks further that after the Labour Party came
into office in 1923, "about half the remaining Fabians in
Parliament became either Under-Secretaries or Parliamentary
Private Secretaries to Ministers, all positions of greater or
less influence with the Government".
The following extract from the Evening Standard, London,
May 28, 1931, shows the accuracy of Mr. Pease's statement
and will serve to further enlighten our readers as to the full
significance of present events.

The Government is to be presented with
a brand new policy. Certain ministers are
to take part in its preparation.
It is called a " long run " policy, and is
planned " for ten years ahead. "
To-morrow evening a group of
Socialists and Trade Unionists will begin
fashioning the new plan at a meeting to be
held at Transport House. The prime
movers are Major C. R. Attlee
(Postmaster-General), and Mr. G. D. H.

among those expected to accept the
invitation of Major Attlee and Mr. Cole at

AFTER THE WEEK-END
PARTIES.

The new policy—or the plan for a new
policy—had its origin in a series of house
parties held last year at Easton Lodge (the
Labour Chequers), when Socialist politicians, economists and trades unionists
foregathered at week-ends. Out of these
meetings grew the new Fabian Research
Bureau (of which Major Attlee is chairman
and Mr. Cole secretary), which received
the official blessing of the Labour
movement two months ago and is now
established in premises in Abingdon
street.

One of the chief ideals of this Society is the extinction of
the poor as evidenced by the following extract from The
Sunday Express (London) of May 17, 1931.

The best known and cleverest Destructionist laws now on
the statute books are those of the Income Tax

564

OCCULT THEOCRASY

and the Inheritance Tax. This form of taxation is calculated
eventually to precipitate Municipalisation and Nationalisation
which also are part of the Fabian scheme for world peifection.
This ideal is to be achieved by the gradual expropriation and
pauperisation of all classes by systematic, economic pressure,
each class to be separately ruined according to the best means
available for ruining it. Municipalisation and Nationalisation
means control by government, or, in other words, domination
by ONE GREAT TRUST.
Is this Socialism ?
There is nothing new or extraordinary in this plan for
World control by a centralized, Super-Capitalist power.
It is the plan so minutely explained in The Protocols of the
Wise Men of Zion.
It is the plan of modern Judeo-Masonic Russian Soviet
Communism.
It is the plan of Weishaupt's Illuminati and that of
International Freemasonry symbolized by the three points of
Albert Pike — Destruction, Materialism, Imposition.
One is all and all is one.
It should here be noted that the tax question is handled no
differently by Conservative Governments, when in power,
than by Labour or Liberal Governments and it is well known
that any Conservative daring to question the Fabian policy of
confiscatory taxation would commit immediate political
suicide.
The stranglehold of Fabian Babouvism on England may
however eventually be mitigated by an international
organization of taxpayers combining as a counter
revolutionary body. Who knows ?

HERMETIC SOCIETY
(Founded 1884)
This spiritistic Society was founded in London on May 9,
1884, by Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland, both
members of the Theosophical Society.
According to R. Guenon, it advocates a Gnostic mixture
of Christianity and Buddhism.
For Anna Kingsford, as for Mme Blavatsky, the Christs are
beings who have succeeded in developing in themselves
certain superior powers latent in all men. This is presumably
the " Serpent Power " or Kundalini, the Sex Force. Jesus is
not the historical personage Jesus Christ. Jesus is only an
initiate, one of " the Christs " incarnating through the ages in
different bodies, other incarnations of the " Christ force "
having been in the persons of Maitreya Bouddha, Krishna and
the various prophets of the other religions.
As a foundation for a Universal World Religion, the idea is
a clever one but its consequences are that anyone who makes
enough fuss about himself can become a god, thus reducing
the idea ad absurdum.
This is the principle which when further elaborated leads
to the usual Gnostic belief that " Man is God ".
Man being God is thus infallible therefore, as God

HERMETIC

can " do what he will ". This convenient principle leads in
turn to an equally convenient code of morals which,
unfortunately, eventually leads to the abyss.
Anna Kingsford and her society were in close contact with
MacGregor Mathers the head of " Golden Dawn ".
The Hermetic Society eventually became known as " The
Esoteric Christian Union ". 1

This society was founded in England in 1888. It admits
men and women.
As a branch of Occult Masonry, its esoteric teaching is a
blend of modern Tibetan magic and Theosophy. (See
Chapters on Lamaism and Theosophy).
In his History of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia 1 M.
W. Supreme Magus Dr. William Wynn Westcott IX, P. M. P.
Z., 30°, informs us that " in association with himself and Dr.
Woodman ", R. W. Frater MacGregor Mathers J. S. M. IX "
founded the Isis-Urania Temple of the Hermetic Students of
the G D. (Golden Dawn) and that he (Mathers) was then (in
1900) the Chief Adept of the entirely Esoteric Order of the R.
R. and A. C. in France, Great Britain and other countries. "
Thus the story basing its foundation on the finding, by A. F.

shown to have been a fabrication calcu1. Presented to the British Museum Library 5/11 /05, London. Privately printed Dec. 30th 1900, see p. 13.

lated presumably to hide the direct connection with the "
Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. "
William Wynn Westcott in the above mentioned book
gives the following epitome of the Masonic career of
Mathers.
" R. W. Frater MacGregor Mathers (Comte Mac-Gregor de
Glenstrae), the present Junior Substitute Magus, was admitted
to Freemasonry in the Hengist Lodge at Bournemouth and
was an early member of the Correspondence Circle of the
Quatuor Coronati Lodge at which he was a frequent speaker
before he settled in Paris. He is a very famous occult student,
and has contributed several learned lectures to the
Metropolitan College. He is the author of the Kabalah
Unveiled, the Tarot Cards, The Key of Solomon the King and
The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. "
Mrs. MacGregor Mathers, the sister of Henri Berg-son, the
Jewish-French philosopher, received clair-voyantly most of
the early teaching still used in the order from the " Hidden
Secret Chiefs of the Third Order. " 3
A. E. Waite was an early member of the " Golden Dawn ",
but at a meeting held at Dr. Felkin's residence in 1903,
according to Dr. Felkin's history, " a split occurred, as Waite
and his followers denied the existence of the Third Order,
refused to have examinations in the inner, objected to all
occult work, and said they must work upon purely mystic
lines. "
In consequence of the split, the old organization of Golden
Dawn changed its name to Stella Matutina with Aleister
Crowley and William Wynn Westcott at its head while the

Modern Illuminism, as we know it, was founded by Karl Kellner
in 1895. He died in 1905 and was succeeded by Theodore Reuss, the
agent of John Yarker.
In 1902, Reuss named William Wynn Westcott as Regent of the
Illuminati in England thus establishing the interlocking directorate
between Soc. Rosicru-ciana in Anglia and German Illuminism. This

This publication also states that " the dispersion of the
original secret wisdom having led to confusion, it was
determined by the Chiefs of all these Orders to recombine
and centralize their activities, even as white light, divided in a
prism, may be recomposed. "
" Secret wisdom " in the case of masonic societies of any
kind is invariably synonymous with " occult knowledge. "

MODERN ILLUMIN1SM

573

In the case of the 0. T. 0. the practice of the " secret wisdom
" begins with the understanding of the very name of the order.
The book referred to above contains the following
information on page 200 : " The letters O. T. O. represent the
words Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of the Temple of the
Orient, or Oriental Templars); but they have also a secret
meaning for initiates. "
Were we to make a guess at the secret meaning ot the O. T.
O., we would borrow the words of Godfrey Higgins, the
author of Anacalypsis and, with him, " penetrate into the
Sanctum Sanctorum of the ancient philosophers of India,
Egypt, Syria and Greece. " There shall we discover the secret
meaning of the Order of To Ov, Greek term for the emanation
of fluid or invisible fire. It is the To Ov of neo-platonism of
which Godfrey Higgins writes : "I am convinced that the
emanation of the To Ov was believed to be this fire. "
The To Ov was supposed to be duplicate, then from that to
triplicate. From him proceeded the male Logos, and the
female Aura or Anima or Holy Ghost in ancient times always
female. The To Ov was supposed in himself to possess the
two principles of Generation.
The reader who already knows the meaning of this " fire "
otherwise known as Kundalini, sex-force, astral light, etc. will
easily understand the phallic hidden meaning of the O. T. O.
However, it would hardly be fair to leave such a statement
under the classification of either suggestion or assumption.
Proof might be demanded and proof therefore is appended.
The Equinox states that " it was Karl Kellner who revived
the esoteric organization of the 0. T. 0. and initiated the plan
now happily complete of bringing all occult bodies again
under one governance. "
In the " Gnostic Mass " printed in the same volume,

574

OCCULT THEOCRASY

mention is made, in one of the orisons, of the saints among
which are named Karl Kellner and Theodore Reuss.
From notes written by Theodore Reuss himself and from
correspondence between him and Karl Kellner, the basic
principles of the 0. T. 0. have become known and bear out the
statement that this organization was formed for the express
purpose of substituting the phallic religion for Christianity.
The conception of the O. T. O. was far from being original
but it was undoubtedly reformed by the two Germans above
named. 2 It was no vain boast on the part of the writer in The
Equinox to name all the orders as concentrated in the O. T. O.,
for proof has been obtained that both Karl Kellner and
Theodore Reuss were, among a host of others, in close
masonic relationship with John Yarker, William Wynn
Westcott, Supreme Magus of Soc. Rosicruciana in Anglia, a
Warden of the Grand Lodge of England, Papus of the
Martinists, etc.
Apparently all concurred in the formation of the esoteric
doctrine of the Order of Oriental Templars.
In the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris is filed a document,
dated 1917, containing the constitution and certain
information concerning the O. T. O. It states that " The
Ancient Order of Oriental Templars ", an organization
formerly known as The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, has
been re-organized and re-constituted.
As evidenced by the Reuss papers, one may gather that the
O. T. O. has existed since 1902. Prior to 1917, the official
date of its foundation, it was presumably
a secret
organization, operating under
2. The German Organ of the Sect was The Oriflamme.

MODERN ILLUMINISM

575

Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites, acting, as these papers
indicate, as the link between this organization and the various
unofficial International occult groups. 3
The prominent persons connected with this organization at
its start were : John Yarker, William Wynn Westcott, Papus,
Karl Kellner, Theodore Reuss, Mac-Gregor Mathers, Franz
Hartmann and Aleister Crowley.
Apart from its secret phallic doctrine the 0. T. 0. seeks to
unite with a revival of Gnosticism, the study of the Jewish
Cabala, Esoteric Lamaism and Indian Yogism. It seeks to
extract from their combined doctrines the practical
application of Eastern Sorcery and Western Witchcraft,
wherein medicine and hypnotism occupy a place of prime
importance, serving solely materialistic ends.
The reader can always be referred to the press for
descriptions of the practices of the present Chief of the Order
who was obliged to leave Italy following an investigation into
his magic practices at Cefalu near Palermo in Sicily.
Calling himself " The Master Therion", Aleister Crowley is
also known under the name of Frater Per-durabo and, from his
own extravagant writings, we know that he looks upon
himself as a reincarnation of Eliphas Levi etc. etc.
To give the reader a feeble idea of the perversion of the O.
T. O. we quote the following : — " The blood is the life. This
simple statement is explained by the Hindus by saying that the
blood is the principal vehicle
3. Article IV, Section 3, of the constitution of the O. T. O.
provides that " The person (male or female) filling this office

office shall appoint his or her successor. "

of those savages who tear the heart and liver from an
adversary, and devour them while yet warm. In any case it
was the theory of the ancient Magicians, that any living being
is a storehouse of energy varying in quantity according to the
size and health of the animal, and in quality according to its
mental and moral character. At the death of the animal this
energy is liberated suddenly.
" The animal should therefore be killed within the Circle,
or the Triangle, as the case may be, so that its energy cannot
escape. An animal should be selected whose nature accords
with that of the ceremony, — thus, by sacrificing a female
lamb one would not obtain any appreciate quantity of the
fierce energy useful to a Magician who was invoking Mars. In
such a case a ram would be more suitable. And this ram
should be virgin — the whole potential of its original total
energy should not have been diminished in any way. For the
highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that
victim which contains the greatest and purest force. A male
child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most
satisfactory and suitable victim.
" For evocations it would be more convenient to place the
blood of the victim in the Triangle, the idea being that the
spirit might obtain from the blood this subtle but physical
substance which was the quintessence of its life in such a
manner as to enable it to take on a visible and tangible shape.

" Those magicians who object to the use of blood have
endeavoured to replace it with incense. For such a purpose
the incense of Abramelin may be burnt in large quantities.
" But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more
efficacious ; and for nearly all purposes human sacrifice is
the best. The truly great Magician will be able to use his own
blood, or possibly that of a disciple, and that without
sacrificing the physical life irrevocably. "

It is even suggested by Miss Murray in The Witchcult in
Western Europe that most of the legends of transformations
of witches into cats, horses and other animals arose from
references by other witches to craft adepts by the costumes
and masks these had worn during the witchcraft ceremonies.
Thus again, the witchcraft of the Middle Ages is reflected
in the occultism of today.
The philosophical teachings of the 0. T. 0. seem to be
adequately summarized by its leader in the following sentence

: " This is in fact the formula of our Magick; we insist that all
acts must be equal ; that existence asserts the right to exist ;
that unless evil is a mere term expressing some relation of
haphazard hostility between forces equally self-justified, the
universe is as inexplicable and impossible as uncompensated
action ; that the orgies of Bacchus and Pan are no less
sacramental than the Masses of Jesus ; that the scars of
syphilis are sacred and worthy of honour as such. "
Eliphas Levi, quoting from the Oupnek'hat, the standard
Indian book on Magic (Histoire de la Magie, p. 76) outlines
the same moral code ;
" It is permissible to lie in order to facilitate marriage and
in order to exalt the virtues of a brahmin or the qualities of a
cow.
" God is truth and in him light and darkness are one. He
who knows that never lies, for, if he wishes to lie his lie
becomes a truth.

does, he is never guilty. Even should he be twice parricide,
even though he should have killed a brahmin initiated into the
mysteries of the Vedas, whatever he may do, his light is never
less, for, says God, ' I am the universal soul, in me are good
and evil to correct one another. ' He who knows that is never a
sinner ; he is universal as I am myself. " 8
Is this not the ever recurring dogma of Manichean
Dualism ?
Every effort is made to attract wealthy people, mostly
women, to the " Profess Houses " of the Order of O. T. O. In
these centres, where the " Nudity cult " and other
eccentricities are cultivated, the victims become quickly
amenable to the insinuating suggestions of such as covet their
wordly goods.
To enhance its attractiveness to the public, the system is
represented as embodying the secret knowledge which leads
to all material success. Playing on the egoistical instincts of
humanity, the O. T. O. attracts within its orbit all those who,
with inordinate ambition and limited capacity, hope in some
nebulous way, through the Glorification of self, to save
humanity.
There seems no doubt that the head of the O. T. O. is
justified in saying that this order reigns above all others as,
everything, from political espionage to blackmail may
emanate from it.
Like numerous organizations such as Mazdaznans and
Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophism, it lays great stress upon
physical culture and rhythmic movements. Pretences of
producing renewed youth and vigour attracts many adepts.
Moreover, it promises its initiates the attainment of their
ambition and desires. The

Advertising the accomplishment of such feats attracted

As to the American house of the same type, the scandalous

Consciously or unconsciously the artist spoke the truth.
Psychiatrists tell us that this school of insidious humbug is
simply an elaboration of the policy of the interruption of
ideas leading to total incoherence and madness. " Cubist " art
is an effort to produce certain psychic effects obtainable by
optical illusion. Beauty has nothing to do with it. The cubist
school is not in the realm of art at all. It belongs to that of
medicine and psychic science. Those who forget that this
devastating fad of " The Interrupted Idea " can be extended to
music, literature and every other phase of human effort, do so
at their peril.
A mind that is positive cannot be controlled. For the
purposes of occult dominion minds must therefore be
rendered passive and negative in order that control can be
achieved. Minds consciously working to a definite end are a
power, and power can oppose power for good or for evil. The
scheme for world dominion might be doomed by the
recognition of this principle alone, but, as it is unfortunately
unrecognized, it remains unchallenged.

In November 1894 William Q. Judge rebelled against Mrs.

On April 27th, 1895, he and his followers seceded from the
Adyar Society and constituted an independent organization
under the name " Theosophical Society of America ". This
organization, which still exists, has its headquarters at
Point-Loma, California, It was first presided over by Ernest
Hargrove and later by Katherine A. Tingley. It has branches
in Sweden and Holland.
Katherine A. Tingley, known to her followers as " The

Not till 1900, when the Grand Orient virtually took over

Greeks and Armenians, did this movement assume a serious
aspect.
Vicomte Leon de Poncins in The Secret Powers behind the
Revolution (page 66) giving the history and origin of the
Young Turk Movement adds the following information taken
from the Masonic organ of the Grand Orient, The Acacia
(October 1908).
" A secret Young Turk council was formed and the whole
movement was directed from Salonica.
Salonica, the most Jewish town in Europe — 70,000 Jews
out of a population of 100,000 — was specially suitable for
the purpose. It already contained several Lodges in which the
revolutionaries could work without being disturbed. These
Lodges are under the protection of European diplomacy and
as the Sultan was without weapons against them his fall was
inevitable. "
He further adds : —
" The Young Turks entered these lodges and met

there in order to organize and prepare the revolution.
Moreover a great number of the members of the lodges
strengthened the secret Young Turk ' Committee of Union and
Progress '... On the 1st May, 1909, the representatives of 45
Turkish lodges met in Constantinople and founded the ' Grand
Orient Ottoman '. Mahmoud Orphi Pasha was nominated
Grand Master... A short time after a Supreme Council of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites was also founded and
recognized by the French and Italian authorities. " To
complete this information, we may add that two of the

connected with the Grand Orient of Italy and that of Veritas
was under the Grand Orient of France.

The foundation of Stella Matutina, with Aleister Crowley

Outer which occurred in 1903. It admits men and women.
Dr. Felkin, who had been elected one of the three members
of the Council governing the Society in 1902 was appointed
head of Stella Matutina by Rudolph Steiner in 1912 at which
date A. E. Waite's temple, Golden Dawn, received the order
to join with it.
Dr. Felkin held this office until 1919.
We are told by " Inquire Within ", author of Light-bearers

FEIN

(Founded 1905)

Sinn Fein, an Irish patriotic organization advocating
boycott and passive resistance against England was founded
by Arthur Griffiths in 1905. He was succeeded as president in
1917 by Eamon de Valera. By that time the Society was
controlled and subsidized by the Clan-na-Gael and Germany.
After the start of the World War in 1914, it asserted itself
as the open foe of England.
Richard Dawson in Red Terror and Green, page 176,
publishes a despatch sent to Count von Bernstorff, the
German Ambassador in the United States at that date. The
document was marked " very secret " and dated April 18,
1916. It reads as follows :
" Judge Cohalan (of New York, U. S. A.) requests the
transmission of the following remarks : The revolution in
Ireland can only be successful with the support of Germany :
otherwise England will be able to suppress it, even though it
be only after a hard struggle. Therefore helpis necessary. This
should consist principally of aerial attacks on England and a
diversion of the fleet simultaneously with the Irish revolution.
Then if possible a landing of arms and ammunition in

Ireland and possibly some officers from Zeppelins. This
would enable the Irish ports to be closed against England.
The services of the revolution, therefore, may decide the war.
"1
The part played by the Irish-Roman Catholic church in
Irish National and International politics is gathered from the
following telegram from Count von Berns-torff to the
German Foreign Office.
" The Bishop of Cork having died, there is a sharp contest
over the succession. The present Assistant Bishop, Daniel
Cohalan, is the choice of the local clergy ; but England is
using unusual efforts to have — appointed. — is strongly
anti-German, although Germany, at our request, released him
shortly after the outbreak of war. Assistant-Bishop Cohalan is
cousin of Judge Cohalan, and strongly Nationalist and
pro-German. He was the intermediary between the insurgent
Cork Volunteers and the British military authorities, and
publicly exposed the gross breach of faith of the English with
the surrendered men. Hence the effort to defeat him through
the English Envoy at the Vatican. It would have a great moral
effect in Rome if Cohalan were chosen. If Germany can exert
any influence to bring about this result it would defeat the
English intrigue against her interests. " 2
Dr. Daniel Cohalan was chosen.
Let us repeat that by a close study of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians and the Knights of Columbus, one cannot fail to
see the control that Freemasonry exercises over the
Irish-Roman Catholic church. This, unfortunately, is a phase
of the international situation which
is
generally
overlooked.

(Founded 1908)
This order, which began its existence as an organization in
1908, thanks to the efforts of the Rev. Geikie Cobb, admitting
both men and women on equal terms, no longer accepts men
as candidates, deeming their proper place to be in Lodges
working under the jurisdiction of the United Grand Lodge of
England. It seeks to supplement the work of Grand Lodge.
In 1920, it presented a petition to The Grand Lodge of
England for examination with a view to recognition. To have
acceded to the request would have been poor policy and, in
any case, unnecessary, so Grand Lodge gave the usual answer
and the matter ceased to be further discussed.
By 1927, there were 12 Lodges of this order in Great
Britain. We know it is the policy of the official body to deny
the existence of "real female masonry" and we also know that
many English Masons of high rank as well as members of
other rites continue to believe that there are no " real "
women's lodges.

lying the Prohibition policy of the Federal Council of
Churches, it can at any rate judge of its lesults which are a
national calamity for the United States. No surer method
could have been devised for the promotion of general
subversion and complete disregard of law and order. A
summary of the situation created by Prohibition was given by
Mr. Ralph Shaw during the Congressional hearings already
referred to. He thus expressed himself :
" For the first time in the history of the civilized world,
organized violators of the law are being financed — the
criminal underworld is being financed, and financed
magnificently. Prior to this amendment, the underworld was
dependent for its scanty living upon houses of ill fame and the
gambling resorts. The saloons, deplorable as they were, were
at least observing the law, and they paid taxes to the State.
Now the enormous revenues which were formerly paid into
the Treasury of the Government and the State is going to the
underworld, and it is going by millions.
" Organized society, resenting invasion of the liberty of the
individual, is willing to pay any price to destroy the invasion,
not so much because organized society wants what it pays for,
but in order to show those who have trampled upon the spirit
of liberty that they cannot possibly succeed. The result is that
millions and millions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of
the underworld and making it so powerful financially that it is
able to debauch prosecutors, judges, legislators and all the
instrumentalities of government. "
The truth of these words has been clearly demonstrated in
the sensational revelations made lately in the American press.
It is not overrating the power of the underworld gangsters to
say that they rule the United States for he indeed rules who
is able to " debauch

598

prosecutors, judges, legislators and all the instrumentalities
of government ".
By its fruits shall you judge a tree.
When, in addition to the above one takes into consideration
the friendly support the Federal Council of Churches has
constantly afforded to the subversive " Civil Liberties Union ",
one is entitled to look upon this Federation as upon a tree, the
fruits of which are a menace to the national welfare. 3

SUFISM

CXIX

(OCCIDENTAL)

(Founded 1910)
In his history of Persia, Sir John Malcolm devotes much
space to Sufism or Sopheism.
It is supposed to have been the esoteric knowledge of the
Mohammedan religion and in the possession of Ali and his
successors.
Sufism in Persia dates from A. D. 1500 to 1736 when the
kingdom was conquered by Nadir Shah.
Godfrey Higgins, in Anacalypsis, concludes that Sufism "
is Gnosticism and that if we can discover the one we shall
discover the other. " He tells us however that their (Sufist)
sect has four stages or degrees and that they have " a species
of Masonic or Eleusinian initiation from lower to higher
degrees. "
The subtle metaphysics of Sufism are contained in the
Dabistan and their esoteric teaching is centred around the
principle of life. It is essentially pantheistic, the soul beirg an
emanation of God's essence.
The teaching of Sufism was introduced by Knayat-Khan
into the West in 1910. The centre of teaching

ODBRANA

(Founded 1911)
The Narodna Odbrana was founded in 1911 by the well
known Dr. Karl Kramarsch, the organizer of the Panslavic
movement. It claimed to be a patriotic Serbian organization
pledged to free Serbia from Austrian influence and to achieve
specifically the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Its secret lodge however was closely affiliated to the Crna
Ruka (The Black Hand, a terrorist society) and it had
absorbed the large and well known Slav organization "
Omladina ".
" Sokol ", a group of physical culture clubs, served as a
mask for the wider activities of the Narodna Odbrana in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was stated as a fact by
Cubrilovitch during his trial following the murder of the
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28th, 1914,
which precipitated the World War.
The trial for high treason of Vangaluka which lasted from
Nov. 15 to the spring of 1916 gives a short idea of the
activities of the Narodna Odbrana.
Its aim, the grouping of all the Slav southern states into
one federation, could be achieved only through the death of
high standing personalities and the revolution
601

602

OCCULT THEOCRASY

of the masses. The master mind of the attempt on the
Archduke's life was Radoslav Kazimirovitch, a Freemason,
who had prepared the attempt. He had travelled abroad
extensively, visited all the Lodges and had returned with
revolvers and bombs. Among the murderers, Sovanovitch,
Cabrinovitch and Grabez were Freemasons and Veliko
Cubrilovitch was member of Narodna Odbrana and Sokol.
Gabriel Prinzip, a student, a youth ot 19, the murderer of
the Archduke, was found to have received arms through
Major Tankosich, a Freemason and a friend of the Serbian
Crown Prince Alexander, His assistant assasin, the
bomb-thrower Cabrinovitch, stated openly at his trial that in
Masonry, killing was permissible, adding further that the heir
to the throne oi Austria had been condemned to death by the
Freemasons two years previously but that hitherto, no one had
been found to execute the sentence.
The Serbians however could not divulge the secrets of the
Serbian Lodge Narodna Odbrana which, in secret alliance
with the Crna Ruka had organized the murder of the
Archduke, heir to the Austrian throne. The documents
concerning the organization of this murder were however
made known and available from the diary of the Serbian
Major Todorovitch which was found in Loczinka, and it was
clearly demonstrated at the trial for high treason of the
bomb-thrower Cabrinovitch that the leading personalities of
the Narodna Obrana were Freemasons. (Refer Kolnische
Volkzeitung. Nov. 1914.).
The Badische Observer for June 1917 says that it cannot be
doubted that the International Lodges (Scottish Rite) must
take the full responsibility for the uprising en masse of the
Rrethren in the Lodges and it is therefore responsible for the
political propaganda (made against Germany) and also for
the murder of

the Archduke which was organized in the Lodges.
On the 15th of September, 1912, La Revue Internationale
des Societes Secretes contained the following lines (page
788).
" Possibly also, some day we will understand the remark
made by a Swiss about the Archduke, heir presumptive to the
Austrian throne. " He is all right. It is a pity that he has been
condemned. He will die on the steps of the throne. "

THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY

The Anthroposophical Society, an offshoot of the
Theosophical Society, was founded on Jan 14, 1913. by
Rudolph Steiner, who had been secretary of the Theosophical
Society of Germany in Berlin since 1902.
Mr. Edouard Schure, the author of the well known book
Les Grands Inities, deserted Mrs. Besant and The
Theosophical Society at the time of the schism and followed
Steiner into the Anthroposophical Society. Later, however,
he reverted also to his old allegiance.
Soon after its creation it practically merged with the
Theosophical Society.
Stsiner was a friend of Dr. Hubbe Schleiden, the Secretary
General of the German Theosophical Society and President
of several German secret societies, the Druidenorden, Black
Templars, Rosicrucians, Ygdrasil.
The headquarters of the cult and its chief temple " The
Goetheaneum" are at Dornach, Switzerland. This building, a
crude " Noah's Ark " specimen of architecture, flaunts the
symbol of the cult above its main portal, while within its
precincts the use of the iod (see Appendix, Chapter on
Symbolism) as a decorative motif further emphasizes its
esoteric phallic dedication.

Luciferianism as advocated by this branch of the sect.
Its Christ teaching is the same as that of the Theo-scphical
Society and The Herm3tic Society.
The Anthroposophical Society is developing an extensive
educational system for children of all ages. Its principal
school, founded in 1919 by Emil Molt, teaching what is
known as the Waldorf System, l is at Stuttgart, Germany. The
Society conducts a school, The New School, at 40 Leigham
Court Road, Streatham, London, and contemplates many
further acquisitions along these lines.
Space does not permit of further elaboration of the Steiner
Educational system which robs the child of its birthright of
innocence and ideals to plunge it into the
grossest
materialism.
Steiner died in 1925 and was succeeded by Karl Unger.

1915 under the auspices of the Clan-na-Gael.
As regards this organization Captain Pollard gives the
following facts : —
" T. St. John Gafmey was appointed representative of the
Friends of Irish Freedom for Europe. A bureau was
established in Stockholm, whither Gafmey repaired, and from
there and at Berlin maintained, along with George

"7
These attacks ultimately provoked a congressional
investigation into the Society during which the details
relevant to its organization above given were read into the
record. Many charges were brought against the klan on that
occasion but none was satisfactorily proved.
After five years of quiet uninterrupted organization, the
society, which had adopted for its uniform the white hoods of
the Ku-Klux Klan, its ancestor of the reconstruction period of
American history, had reached proportions which the
subversive element in the United States regarded with great
uneasiness.
The Jewish power, in particular, recognized a challenge to
its established dominion of American Freemasonry for the K.
K. K. constituted an " Imperium in Imperio " in the heart of
Judeo-American Freemasonry, a Christian empire sound and
free and, as a masonic sect, one refusing to adhere to three of
its chief tenets namely; Mongrelization of race,
Anti-christianity, and Internationalism.
The great war was over and the new immigrant "
Americans " were mostly natives of the different ghettos of
Poland, Russia, the Balkan states and Germany. American
ideals meant nothing to them. New York city alone numbers
over two million Jews in its heterogeneous population and
was derisively known by native gentile Americans as " Jew
York ".
The Americans had realized too late that in the melting pot
of Israel Zangwill nothing melted.
The American Jewish Kahal, fully aware of the menace to
their peoples from this new nationalist movement, took
precautions against it.

With great political dexterity, the whole press concurring,
the K. K. K. was pointed out on all sides as the great foe of
the Roman Catholic Church and the Roman Catholics of
America, falling in with the ideas, recognized the K. K. K. as
merely a branch of their old enemy, Freemasonry.
So the Roman Catholics and the Ku-Klux Klan took up the
old fight and the Jews looked on, while their two old rivals
proceeded to destroy each other. Divide et Impera !

(Founded 1919)
In 1917, Leon Trotzky, through the intercession of an
agent acting for Mr. Jacob Schiff of the firm of Kuhn, Loeb
and Co. of New York, broke through the British blockade and
with a cheque on Max Warburg of Hamburg (Mr. Schiffs
brother-in-law) started the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.
Few people seem to be aware of the fact that Mr. Jacob
Schiff was the head of the Russian Section of the Jewish
International World government (Kahal). l
The Third International was founded at a Conference held
in Moscow from March 2-6, 1919. The Russian Bolsheviks
founded the Third or Communist International, sometimes
known as the " Komintern ".
Mrs. Nesta Webster in The Socialist Network (page 44)
describes the foundation of this International political
subversion centre, in the following words :
" The Manifesto of the Conference, issued on September 8,
1919, calling upon the revolutionaries of the

-world, whether Socialist, Syndicalist or Anarchist, to unite as
soon as possible and form a unified Communist Party, was
drafted by a committee consisting of Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev,
Rakovsky and Fritz Platten. Zinoviev, alias Radomislsky,
alias Apfelbaum, alias Ovse Gershon Aronovitch, was
elected President of the Executive Committee. Among those
who later formed the Executive were W. Maclaine and Tom
Quelch of the B. S. P., Jack Tanner and J. T. Murphy of the
Factory and Works Committee of England, Jacques Sadoul, A.
Rosmer and Delignet for France, L. Fraina and A. Stocklitsky
of the American Communist Party, D. Bilan of the American
Communist Labour Party, the Jewish leader of the Dutch
Communists, D. Wyn-koop, whilst the Petrograd Committee
of the Russian Communist Party was represented by N.
Bukharin, V. Vorovsky, G. Klinger and Angelica Balbanova ".
Let no one believe that these people were personalities in the
game. They were agents. Agents only !
" While the Second International was being reconstituted
in Geneva the Red or Third International was holding its
Second Congress, which on July 19, 1920, met at Petrograd,
and then continued its sessions in Moscow from July 23 to
August 7.
" This time it was able to call itself a " World Congress ",
for no less than thirty-seven countries were represented. 2
" At this second Congress the attitude of the Komin-tern
was made clear on two important points :
Parlia-mentarianism and Syndicalism. With regard to the
former, it was frankly stated that the aim of the Communists
was to destroy parliamentarianism, which " has become a
democratic form of the rule of the bourgeoisie.
2. Nesta Webster, The Socialist Network, p. 44 et seq.

616

OCCULT THEOCRASY

At the same time Communists should not refrain from
participating in a political campaign on the score that
parliament is a bourgeois government institution... The
Communist Party enters such institutions not for the purpose
of organization work, but in order to blow up the whole
bourgeois machinery and the parliament itself from within ".
" The foundation of the Third International had immensely
facilitated the spread of Bolshevism by providing the Soviet
Government with a camouflage for its activities. No longer
could groups or individuals working in co-operation with
Moscow be accused of having dealings with a foreign power,
but only with an independent Socialist organization.
"By the end of 1919 the Komintern had spread its tentacles
all over Europe. In December of that year the West European
Secretariat of the Third International, a marvellous
organization controlling a network of smaller organizations,
both open and secret, was established at a Conference
attended by Great Britain. At a further Conference at
Amsterdam in February 1920, it was decided to mark off this
Secretariat as a Central European Secretariat, with
head-quarters at Vienna (later known colloquially as the D. I.
K. I.) and to set up a new Western Secretariat at Amsterdam.
A Southern European Bureau of the Third International
and an Eastern Secretariat of Propaganda, comprising the Far
East, were established. "
In August 1922, the Convention of the Communist Party of
America was raided at Bridgeman, Mich., and numerous
revolutionary documents were seized by the United States
government.
Manifold requests for the recognition of the Soviet
government by the United States of America, were later met
by a refusal on the part of the Senate.

Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee
of Foreign relations, United States Senate
Sixty-eighth Congress
Senate Resolution 50
Declaring that the Senate of the United States
favours the recognition of the Present Soviet
Government in Russia
Year 1924
" It is believed that the evidence presented by the
Department
of
State
at
this
hearing
has
conclusively-established three facts ; First, the essential unity
of the Bolshevik organization known as the Communist Party,
so-called Soviet Government, and the Communist
International, all of which are controlled by a small group of
individuals, technically known as the political bureau of the
Russian Communist Party. Second, the spiritual and organic
connection between this Moscow group and its agent in this
country — the American Communist Party and its legal
counterpart, the Worker's Party. Not only are these
organizations the creation of Moscow, but the latter has also
elaborated their activities. While there may have existed in the
United States individuals, and even groups, imbued with
Marxist doctrines prior to the advent of the Communist
International, the existence of a disciplined party equipped
with a program aiming at the overthrow of the institutions of
this country by force and violence is due to the intervention of
the Bolshevik organization into the domestic political life of
the United States. The essential fact is the existence of an
organization in the United States created by and completely
subservient to
3. Recognition of Russia, p. 530, part 2.

a foreign organization striving to overthrow the existing
social and political order of this country. Third, the
subversive and pernicious activities of the American
Communist Party and the Worker's Party and their
subordinate and allied organs in the United States are
activities resulting from and flowing out of the program
elaborated for them by the Moscow group. "
These findings of the Senate of the United States were duly
brought up before the British Parliament on Monday July 7,
1924 (see Hansard).
They were however disregarded.
The United States alone persevered in its condemnation of
the tyrannical rulers of Russia in opposition to European
countries which had welcomed The Communist International
at Locarno and reinstated its ambassadors as the
representatives of the Russian people.
The Third International disseminates its subversive
propaganda through the medium of so called commercial
organizations such as Amtorg in America and Arcos in
England. These organizations operate in conjunction with
certain powerful banking institutions.
The Communist International and Soviet Russia stand
today as monuments ot the Masonic ideal of Albert Pike
symbolized by the three .-.
Destruction — Its organization of the Terror.
Materialism — Its assault on Religion.
Imposition — Its communist State.

THE FASCISTI
(Founded 1919)

From their activities one may assume the Fascisti to be the
descendants of the Calderari.
After the European War of 1914 certain banks, conscious
of the menace of Satanism, ultimately rechris-tened
Bolshevism, fearing that the monster might get out of hand,
selected certain men whose integrity, patriotism and bravery
they trusted and, by paying them a stipend, kept them as a
nucleus, ready, when the signal was given, to rally to a leader.
Fascism was founded at Milan on March 23, 1919 and
Benito Mussolini became the leader of " the First Fifty-Five
".
On October 27, 1922, the Fascisti marched on Rome.
At a meeting convoked previously, seventy-two
socialist-bolshevist leaders had been summarily dealt with,
thus preparing the way for the Coup d'Etat.
Freemasonry was outlawed in Italy in 1922, and the Grand
Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, Domizio Torregiani, was
arrested and condemned to five years banishment to the
Lipari Islands. A similar fate also awaited Ulisse Bacci, son
and namesake of the confi619

620

dential agent of Crispi, Lemmi and Mazzini forty years ago.
The Fascisti also put an end to the activities of the terrorist
society known as the Mafia in 1928 which, two years
previously, had received its death blow at a trial involving
280 prisoners and 1600 witnesses.
The following reprint from The Daily Telegraph of May
26, 1931, is of interest in this connection :

March wrote to the Grand Master of

had been compelled to reconstitute
themselves outside their own country,
they

had settled temporarily in London.
They added that they had no intention of
disregarding the tradition of nationality by
which Freemasonry was governed or the
territorial rights "which belonged to the
Grand Lodge of England. They also
asserted that they had no desire to make
use of the sovereignty of the Grand Orient
on the territory of the United Kingdom.
"VIEWED WITH SURPRISE"
The Board of General Purposes, in its
report to Grand Lodge for the -meeting on
June 3, says that it has " viewed with

THE

ANTI-SALOON

LEAGUE.

(1920)
The eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the
United States was passed and became the law of the land in
1920.
The Anti-Saloon League, the organization which thus
succeeded in outlawing the use of all wines, spirits and
liquors, was founded in 1874 by a group of Oberlin citizens,
headed by H. Fairchild, who became its first President.
The suggestion made by F. Scott McBride, General
superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League, before the Senate
lobby Committee, on May 9, 1930, that the chief protagonist
of Prohibition in America, The Anti-Saloon League, was
"born of God ?nd will fight on while He leads " precipitated
altercations which, seeming ridiculous to some, suddenly
brought a hitherto unsuspected factor to the fore, in which the
Wet and Dry issue is concerned.
As recorded in the New York Herald of May 10, 1930
(Paris Edition), Mr. McBride's remark provoked the
following conversation :
" When Mr. McBride, referring to drinking, added,
621

622

OCCULT THEOCRASY

" Those things in the way of the progress of the Kingdom of
God must get out of the way ", Senator Blain demanded :
" What authority have you for claiming that the
Anti-Saloon League is a son of God ? "
" The league was born at a prayer meeting in Ober-lin. "
" Did you get a message from God that He gave birth to
your organization ? "
"No. "
" Then what notice did you receive that this had been a
divine conception ? "
" The fact that it was born at a prayer-meeting. We never
have such a meeting without opening with a religious service,
and we are led by the leadership of God just as the activities
of the church. "
" Oh ! So the league dons the cloak of religion ! "
" We do not don the cloak, it is real religion. "
Then Senator Blain, launching into the fray, exclaimed :
" I don't believe that God would approve of some of your
practices, and I think your statement is an outrageous and
sacrilegious thing. That's how I feel about it ! "
To us, attempting to trace the obscure sources of these
movements the following question seems relevant. What
"mediumistic " instructions were received at that prayer
meeting in Oberlin thus to have fanaticised the faithful ?
We note that all religious extravagances seem indeed to
spring from the same root, namely, the exercise of occult
hypnotic influences over the masses to determine any
movement whether religious, social or political. That this is
so has been clearly demonstrated in the articles which deal
with the Moravians, Jansenists,

AMERICAN PROHIBITION

623

Anabaptists, Mormons, etc.
but to be obliged to add
Prohibition to this list comes rather as a shock.
In order that the reader may realize that we have a logical
reason for putting Prohibition in this category of
extravagances we must stress the point of alcohol being
recognized by occultists as a deterrent to hypnotic influences.
Thus the annulling of the receptivity of mediums,
conscious and unconscious, by the general use of alcohol
among the masses, must create serious difficulties to such
powers, if such indeed there be, who seek to rule by thought
transference and absent suggestion.
Alcoholism, being undoubtedly a menace to the life of any
nation, it is natural that the soundest element in the
community should wish to fight the spread of such an evil.
Thus again, the hidden powers wishing to eliminate the use of
Alcohol for their own purposes, found fertile ground on
which to sow the seed of dissension.
This explains the creation of the Anti-saloon League which
was in effect opposed to the interests of the Catholic church
(Vatican) the funds of which, in the United States, had been
largely invested in the whisky trust by the Jew Judge, Max
Pam of New Orleans. The Roman Catholic Church, had, by
this act of its agent, thus been put in the unhappy political
position of fostering the evil of the Saloon !
The move was a clever one, for the Saloon was a manifest
evil and the saloon had to disappear. Its disappearance was
precipitated by the drastic Prohibition law as a consequence
of which, not temperance, but the 18th Amendment, is the
law of the land today.
The following report of what may indeed be termed a
national disaster was given on Feb. 12, 1930, by Hon. George
S. Graham, in his opening speech as chairman

624

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

of the House Committee 71st Congress (U. S. A.) on The
Prohibition Amendment. 1
" The eighteenth amendment and the enforcement law have
been tested for 10 years, without satisfactory results.
Enforcement has left a train of consequences most deplorable
and depressing to every patriot. Killings amounting to over
1,360 have resulted in the last 10 years from enforcement.
One hundred and fifty-one citizens were killed by prohibition
officers, and 64 agents killed by citizens. In one year there
were 77,351 arrests for violations, alleged or real. During the
first year under prohibition there were 29,000 cases instituted,
and during the last fiscal year there were close to 70,000.
Demand for more prisons has been made and new ones
ordered, which it is said will not give relief from overcrowding except for a period of 5 years or possibly 10. Prison
population has jumped 4 per cent per 100,000 in the last five
years. When we add corruption, bribery, demoralization of
the citizenry, disrespect for law, bootlegging, and kindred
offences, does not such a picture call for the fair dispassionate
judgement of men and women, to come together and reason
over what remedy can be devised to abate this sad condition ?
"
Later Mr. Channing Pollock, in his testimony before the
Congressional Committee, made the following statements.
(Pages 176-178)
" At the most unfortunate and dangerous of all dangerous
and unfortunate times, it has bred class hatred, religious
hatred, and sectional hatred.
" I know a great deal about the Federal Council of
Churches of America and I have worked with them a

long time. I know every one of the men mentioned here
to-day very intimately — Doctor Cadman and others. That
contempt of public opinion led the saloon keeper to bring
about prohibition by continuing to do things no people would
stand, and I want to say this, that if these men in the Federal
Council of Churches are not careful, they will bring about the
abolishment of the church for that same reason. People will
not stand that sort of dictation.
I consider the eighteenth amendment the greatest danger in
our national existence. Inability to enforce it spells anarchy;
ability to enforce it spells despotism. Between the two lies the
golden mean of Aristotle, which is good government. "
In reading this indictment we are once more forcibly
reminded of the three points of Albert Pike :
Mr. Pollock
Albert Pike
Anarchy.............................................................. Destruction
Destruction of the Church .................................. Materialism
Despotism............................................................ Imposition.
But meanwhile this " Despotism or Imposition "
established by Prohibition is being helped along its
destructive career by all the occult groups which furthered
the passage of the 18th Amendment.
Among these are The Theosophical Society, Good
Templars, Women's Christian Temperance Union,
Methodist Board of Temperance and Social Service and a
host of others !

THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION
(Founded 1920)
In 1924, a book by R. M. Whitney called The Reds in
America made its appearance. The American Civil Liberties
Union founded by Upton Sinclair had by that time become an
important branch of the Third International so Mr. Whitney
gave several pages to a description of its organization and
methods. All these would be quoted here were it not that
space forbids. Our chief object in including this minor society
among those already mentioned is to show the methods
whereby Communism is rendered palatable to those whose
world it would destroy.
" The American Civil Liberties Union owes its existence to
the notorious pacifist organizations of war-time fame, which
were presumably financed by German agents in this country
working desperately, and for a time successfully, to keep the
United States from entering the war. To be sure, in its present
form it has existed only since January 12, 1920, when it was
formed as an outgrowth and with the merging of various
organizations which were developed during the World War,
dating from October, 1914, and the members of which were
pacifists, defeatists, German agents, radicals of many hues,
communists, I. W. W. and Socialists. Among the
627

organizations included in the merger were such pacifist
bodies as the American League to Limit Armaments,.
Emergency Peace Federation, First American Conference for
Democracy and Terms of Peace, People's Freedom Union,
People's Council of America, American Union against
Militarism, League for Amnesty for Political Prisoners, Civil
Liberties Bureau, National Civil Liberties Bureau, American
Neutral Conference Committees and Legal First Aid Bureau.

" The activities of this organization are extensive. It assists
any radical movement through publications of high standing
in order to influence public sympathy toward the radical
organizations, furnishing attorneys for radical criminals,
conscientious objectors and radical or foreign spies, " bores
from within" in churches, religious and labour organizations,
Women's Clubs, schools and colleges and the American
Federation of Labour, in order to spread radical ideas. The
union maintains a staff of speakers, investigators and lawyers
who are working in all sections of the country. Lawyers are
furnished on short notice wherever a radical criminal gets into
trouble. A press clipping service is maintained which keeps
the organization in close touch with every radical criminal or
group of radical criminals in trouble and immediate financial
aid, publicity and counsel is offered. Aiding in this service are
some 800 co-operating lawyers, and more than a thousand
correspondents and investigators, representing 450 weekly
labour, farmer and liberal papers with 420 speakers and
writers.

Federated Press organization to handle matter requiring
direct contact with the Government.
" The policies of the organization are determined by the
National Committee and the carrying out of them is left to the
Executive Committee which meets weekly. "
Mr. Whitney quotes the following paragraphs from the
1920 Lusk Committee report concerning the American Civil
Liberties Union :
" An examination, however, of the propaganda and
agitation which has been carried on in favor of the forceful
overthrow of this Government shows that it does not consist
of a mere expression of opinion, but invariably advocates
measures for its effectuation. In other words, the
representatives of revolutionary Socialists, Communists,
Anarchists and other groups, state that by doing certain acts
this Government may be overthrown and in each instance the
agitator urges his hearers or his readers to commit those acts.
It is a well settled principle of law that any reasonable man is
responsible for the logical and reasonable consequences of
his acts and utterances.
" While the Constitution of the State of New York
guarantees the right of free speech it also contains the
warning that the citizen may exercise it " being responsible
for the abuse of that right ". The effect of the activities of the
American Civil Liberties Union is to create in the minds of
the ill-informed people the impression that it is un-American
to interfere with the activities of those who seek to destroy
American institutions. They seek to influence legislators and
executives to repeal or veto any act calculated to protect the
State or the Federal Government from the attacks of
agitators. "
After some further analysis this report says :
" The American Civil Liberties Union, in the last analysis,
is a supporter of all subversive movements, and its
propaganda is detrimental to the interests of

630

OCCULT THEOCRASY

the state. It attempts not only to protect crime but to
encourage attacks upon our institutions in every form.
" The union is closely identified with groups in practically
every city in the country known as ' parlor Bolsheviki'.
Speakers are furnished for these dilettante radicals whose
influence would amount to little, but for the fact that they can
be counted upon for financial contributions to any movement
that promises them a thrill. It has been said that many idle men
and women become identified with this parlor Bolshevik
movement through emotionalism and because it gives them
something to think about. Whatever the reason, the Communists and the Civil Liberties Union agitators make use of these
groups for financial aid and as means of spreading
propaganda.
" It is well known ", as Mr. Whitney further explains, " that
the Workers' party, as a branch of the Communist party, has
access to the ' sucker lists ' of people who have contributed to
the finances of the party in various cities, and besides has '
sucker lists ' of its own which are shared by the Communists.
The most remarkable feature of these lists is the number of
names of prominent people upon them. "
Naturally most of the people on these ' sucker lists ' have no
idea what sort of an organization they are assisting, but their
money assists just the same ! Hazy notions of helping the
poor and downtrodden and bettering the condition of the
working classes serve to produce the necessary enthusiasm
leading to subscriptions.
Among the persons whose names have appeared as
members or officers of this society we name the following:
Roger N. Baldwin, Albert De Silver, Scott Nearing and Max
Eastman.

THE V. V. V.
VEREINIGUNG VERGEWALTIGTER VOLKER.

(Founded 1920)
The origin of this society is given by Mrs. Webster in The
Surrender of an Empire (p. 132) in the following terms :
" The League of Oppressed Peoples had been founded in
the United States under the name of the ' League of Small and
Subject Nationalities ' by Dudley Field Malone, attorney for
Ludwig Martens, who was afterwards appointed Bolshevist
ambassador to the United States by Chicherin. Aleister
Crowley, the well-known Satanist, who was then working in
the United States for Germany, was connected with this
association through one of its agents in America... After the
Armistice the society became the ' League of Oppressed
Peoples ', a name coined by the Germans who had declared
themselves to be the champions of the numerous oppressed
peoples of the British Empire ".
In the archives of certain Secret Services, there is a report
stating that John Wesley De Kay, having travelled from
Switzerland to Berlin on a German diplomatic passport, had
an interview there with Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, and
four members of the
631

632

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Druidenorden of which the direct outcome was the
foundation in January 1920 of the V. V. V.
This organization was to operate in a subordinate capacity
to the well known masonic " Druidenorden " and, at a secret
meeting held Jan. 14, 1920, a certain Colonel was elected
President of the Council. At the same meeting, a council of
the League was founded and provision was made for the
headquarters, and representatives in every country. It was
also further decided that only bonafide accredited
representatives in a recognized revolutionary society, with an
occasional " Socialist Humanitarian ", would be eligible for
membership in this council, two representatives being the
quota allotted to each member country.
It was further ordered that a secret Inner Council, the very
existence of which was to be ignored by the General Council
and the members of the League, was to be formed. Five
persons composed this secret council of which John De Kay
was the President for life.
The Swiss branch of the society was founded on the same
day as the German by a colleague of De Kay.
" The Druidenorden " writes Mrs. Webster, " was the
concrete expression of the idea... of the ' Eastern School ' of
German Monarchists, who believed in coming to an
understanding with Soviet Russia for the purpose of a war of
revenge against the Allies or, failing this, of undermining
them by revolutionary propaganda, particularly throughout
the British Empire. This section of German Monarchists
never ceased to co-operate with the Bolsheviks after Lenin
and his companions in the sealed train were sent by them to
Russia : and the marvellous organization of Soviet
propaganda abroad has been largely attributable to the
German as well as the Jewish brains behind it.
" Up till about 1922 the activities of this German

THE V. V. V.

633

group and the Soviet Government were indistinguishable.
Radek — alias Sobelssohn — acted as the link between
Berlin and Moscow. The Druidenorden, like the Komintern,
was internationally organized with lodges in Rome, Milan,
Prague, Budapest and ramifications in England, France,
Holland, Italy, Algeria, Canada, Egypt, India, Vladivostok
and Japan. At the same time it had two important centres in
Switzerland — at Zurich and Lugano — under Baron von A.
and Baron von D. who co-operated with the Soviet agents in
that country by supplying revolutionaries throughout the
world with arms, ammunition and propaganda, Bolshevist,
pro-German and anti-Entente.
" This inner secret society was behind the Moplah risings
in India in 1921, and it was again the Druidenorden that
recruited revolutionary Jews in Germany, and passed them
through Switzerland via Milan and Genoa to Palestine, in
order to stir up feeling against Great Britain. "
" There was also a direct connection between the
Druidenorden and the I. R. B. (Irish Republican Brotherhood)
though relations with Ireland were principally maintained
through the V. V. V. and its agents in America. "
In 1922 the V. V. V. founded a subsidiary organization : "
The League of Oppressed Peoples of the East, calculated to
coordinate the activities of various societies such as those of "
The Friends of Soviet Russia " and the " Friends of India ".

JUVENILE FREEMASONRY
(Founded 1920)

If a novice is not the son of a Freemason he must,
according to the rule, be 25 years old; that is to say, he must
be the age demanded by the Priesthood before he can become
a Mason. The son of a Freemason, however, can obtain a
dispensation as regards the age at which he is admitted into
the order. It is only necessary for him to be 18 years of age.
According to an article in Freemasonry Universal, Vol. I,
Part I, June 1925, page 22 — " There are two movements in U.
S. A., however, particularly worthy of attention. The first is
the establishment of two orders, for boys and girls
respectively, under the age of 21. These are more or less
attached to Masonry, and the Order of De Molay, which is
open to boys, and which five years ago consisted of nine
members, to-day has over 1,177 Chapters, with over 125,000
members. The Order of the Rainbow for Girls, which was
only started in 1923, now has over 300 Assemblies, with at
least 20,000 members, and is increasing by leaps and bounds
".
We refrain here from going too closely into the subject

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
(Founded 1920)
The League of Nations came into being on January 10,
1920, when the Treaty of Versailles, incorporating the first
26 articles of " The Covenant of the League " was ratified.
Cradled in Mazzini's Masonic Young Europe movement,
the League and Treaty are the apotheosis of the policy of the
old International Commitree of London and its satellite
societies.
Of these, Mrs Webster, in her book The Surrender of an
Empire, 1 gives us the following epitome :
" It was towards 1850 that a modified form of this scheme
became known as ' The United States of Europe ', The actual
formula seems first to have been used publicly by Victor
Hugo in his opening speech to the Peace Congress held in
Paris in 1849, but it was not until some years later that it was
formally adopted as the slogan of International Socialism.
The impulse came again from the masonic lodges. In 1866,
a Freemason named Santallier composed a work on Pacifism
for his brother masons which led to the
1. Op. cit., p. 56.

THE LEAGUE

OF NATIONS

G37

founding of the Union de la Paix, under the presidency of
another Freemason, a German Jew named Bielefeld. The
movement spread to Switzerland and on September 5, 1867, a
further Congress was held. The proceedings were enlivened
by a duel between the Constitutionalists and the Socialists,
who declared that kings, soldiers — and some added priests
— must be swept away in order to make room for the new
Federation of Republics. The Socialists, led by Emile Acollas,
won the day. Dupont, Karl Marx's right hand, was invited to
represent the First International, of which he was secretary.
Longuet, Marx's son-in-law, also attended. It was finally
decided to found a " League of Peace and Liberty ", with a
Franco-German periodical, entitled Les Etats-Unis de
I'Europe, as its organ. This association, the ' Ligue
Internationale de la Paix et de la Liberte ', still exists and
publishes its paper ".
It is small wonder that members of Fabianism should have
made themselves the heralds of the idea of the League of
Nations. In 1917, Henry Noel Brailsford, helped by Noel
Buxton, a noted Fabian, had written a book called A League
of Nations, in which he outlined its principles and eventual
organization. Later, Fabians proudly proclaimed that with the
advent of the Labour Party, which was their party, they had
gained full control of the League of Nations. But the most
outspoken statements on its spirit of internationalism comes
from the pen of one of the Founders of Fabianism, George
Bernard Shaw.
In April, 1929, the Fabian Society published a tract (No.
226) called The League of Nations, in which the noted author
gives an account of the strange relations which exist between
the members of the respective national governments and
those of the international government of the
League.
Alluding to an incident

638

OCCULT THEOCRASY

which took place at Geneva between Mr Locker-Lampson,
Under-Secretary to the British Foreign Office, sent by his
Government and representing it, and Sir Eric Drummond,
permanent Secretary-General of the League at Geneva,
George Bernard Shaw writes :
"These deciduous members arrive mostly in scandalous
ignorance of the obligations already contracted by their
Governments to the permanent governing bodies of the
League. As party men they are at the opposite pole to the '
good Europeans ' of Geneva. As patriots they conceive
themselves to be advocates of British national interests (not to
say nationalist spies in the international camp) and expect to
be supported devotedly by
their distinguished
fellow-countrymen on the permanent staffs. They are rudely
undeceived the moment they begin their crude attempts at
sabotage.
" Thus the British Jingo Imperialist finds himself writhing
in the grip of Sir Eric Drummond whilst the French
Poincarist-Militarist takes the full count in the first round
from Mr Albert Thomas...
" This situation, in which the permanent nominees of the
constituent governments are thrown into resolute opposition
to their deciduous representatives is chronic at Geneva. One
of Mr Albert Thomas's greatest victories there was won over
the French Government when he defeated its attempt to
exclude agricultural workers from the scope of the Labour
Office on the ground that they are not 'industrials'. The really
great thing that is happening at Geneva is the growth of a
genuinely international public service, the chiefs of which are
ministers in a coalition which is, in effect, an incipient international Government. In the atmosphere of Geneva
patriotism perishes ; a patriot there is simply a spy who
cannot be shot.
" In short, the League is a school for the new inter-

THE

LEAGUE OF NATIONS

639

national statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office
diplomacy ".
The struggle described by Bernard Shaw as taking place at
Geneva between the Assembly — or " Hot Air Exchange " —
as he terms it, and the Secretariat of the League on the one
hand and the International Labour Office on the other is also
edifying. The Labour Office, as its offspring, has the blessing
of Fabianism and we are informed that together with its
friends it is " quite willing to let the Secretariat die a natural
death. "
How reminiscent of Marxism are all these utterances of
one of the notorious disciples of the School of Destruction!
Another aspect of the League of Nations was given by an
ardent Zionist — Jessie E. Sampter, who wrote that " the
League of Nations is an old Jewish ideal, the ideal of
nationalism and internationalism... The Jewish God-ideal
implies democracy and internationalism ". Further the same
author vouchsafed the information that " the solution of
self-determination and the recognition of the necessity for a
League of Nations to protect small peoples from future
aggression have grown in large measure out of the claims of
Zionists. " 2
We also know that Lord Robert Cecil, Chairman of the
League of Nations Union, in speeches he made in the United
States, in favour of the League, predicted that eventually it
would have its seat at Jerusalem. Thus speaking, he was only
voicing the Zionist statements which had already been made
by Leon Simon in Studies in Jewish Nationalism. 3

aspects we are led to draw the logical conclusion that it is a
Judeo-Masonic achievement.
As the embryonic future World Government, destined
shortly to be the Central Government of the European
Federated States, the League of Nations is at present
concerned with two schemes wherewith it will eventually be
enabled to enforce its dictates — viz : one, an international
army and air force, the other the International Bank which is
already aiming at the creation and circulation of an
international universal money. Meanwhile, its creators and
sponsors are endeavouring to maintain the illusion of
Democracy and its manifold benefits whereas, in fact, they
have already erected at Geneva a temple to the Autocracy and
Tyranny of Internationalism.

CXXXII

KENJUKAI

The Tenri Kenjukai, a Japanese politico-religious sect, is
an offshoot of the main cult known as Tenrikyo, itself
dissident from Shintoism, the national religion of Japan.
It is subversive, inasmuch as its adherents object mostly to
one of the main tenets of the Japanese religion, namely, the
traditional regard held for the Imperial Family.
When, in April 1928; the police discovered several plots
for the assassination of members of the Imperial Family and
Conservative Statesmen, it came to light that the Communists
from Moscow had had, as chief tools, Tenri Kenjukaists.
Numerous arrests were made, including that of the founder
of the sect, Aijiro Onishi. His life and behaviour bear a great
resemblance to that of the leaders of the O. T. O., of Theodor
Reuss, Rudolf Steiner, Aleister Crowley, Gourgieff, as also of
Piggott of the " Abode of Love " and others.
Like them, Aijiro Onishi exacted a vow of poverty from his
adherents who had to turn over to him all their property. With
this wealth he had built for him641

BUCHMANISM
(Founded in 1928)

In the spring of 1928 much perturbation was caused in
educational circles by the discovery that Buchmanism, defined by
English University authorities as perverted religious mania, had
permeated men's as well as women's colleges at Oxford.
his, the Oxford undergraduates' weekly, attacked Buchmanism
in its leading article in one of its May issues ot 1928. On May 17,
1928, the Daily Telegraph partly reproduced it in the. following
article :

" In the women's colleges, " declares
the paper, "Buchmanism is procuring the

" The theory of Buchmanism ", says the leading

for surplus religious feeling ; and so, no doubt,
they are.
" GIGGLES AND FANATICISM. "
" These meetings, however, have, roughly,
the same relation to Buchman-ism as a dentist's
waiting-room has tc the pain the dentist is about
to inflict. Attendance at several of them is a
preliminary step to admission to a group, a
gathering of perhaps four or five friends, so
delightfully informal that it seems uncharitable
tc call it clandestine. Here, in an atmosphere
hovering between giggles and fanaticism,
restraint is flung aside, souls are laid bare by
hysterical confession, and, with a fervour which
no longer pretends to be religious, the tenets of
the doctrine are discussed.
" Now, Buchmanism attributes to
Christianity a four-fold foundation on honesty,
unselfishness, purity and love. It is worthy of
remark that the first two qualilies are seldom
considered worthy ot discussion. Honesty, in
fact, is not a conspicuous feature of these
proceedings, from which the sceptical are
firmly excluded, and in which the perfervid are
virtually hoodwinked.

" In the women's colleges, although iu name

several others devotion to the cult is producing
lesults not usually associated with the practice
of Christianity. '1 he authorities appear to be
alarmed but remain apathetic It is time
something was done about it.
" Buchmanism is not widespread. Probably,
in Oxford, it never will be! We do not wish to
exaggerate the danger it represents, but neither
do we wish other people to minimise or ignore
that danger. Its worst effects, though almost
impossible to cure, can be prevented.
Accordingly we take this opportunity of asking
the University authorities to exert the power
which Is undoubtedly theirs to remove fiom
Oxford those responsible for a phenomenon
which would be faintly comic were it not apt to
produce such extremely unpleasant results. "

THE RACKETS
(Founded 1928)

Racketeering finds a place in this study on Occult
Theocrasy because its adepts are the faithful servants of
Mammon and their methods of terrorism, intimidation,
plunder and murder are analogous to those of the Thugs,
worshippers of Siva. Moreover, according to Fred Pasley,
author of Al Capone and Muscling In, racketeering is
organized and controlled by the members of the Italian
Society, the Unione Sicilione, the Mafia, which he calls an
invisible government.
Racketeering, as a system for plundering legitimate
business, often with the connivance of the police and
government officials, has assumed formidable proportions
within the last few years.
Mr. Fred. D. Pasley, in his book Muscling In, states that "
The Rackets " started with Prohibition in the United States.
In 1928, after Mussolini had suppressed the terrorist
Sicilian Society known as The Mafia, whose members took
an oath to " resist Law and defeat Justice ", they found a
refuge in Chicago, U. S. A. There, through their affiliation
with the Unione Sicilione, later known as the Italo-American
Union, they manoeuvred them645

646

OCCULT THEOCRASY

selves into a position which enabled them to cooperate with
the vice and liquor purveyors of the city on the one side and
the political party machines on the other.
To quote Mr. Pasley : 1
" The Unione Sicilione had become a $ 10,000,000 a year
enterprise, supplying the basic ingredient for the synthetic
Bourbon, Rye, Scotch, brandy, rum and gin marketed in and
around Chicago, and controlling the sale of sugar to the
affiliated distillers of the West Side Italian district : Melrose
Park, Cicero, and Chicago Heights. "
The head of the Unione, "... ruled locally as a despot over
some 15,000 Sicilians and dominated the councils of the
Unione's branches in St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh,
Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York City. " He was
virtually the chief executive in the invisible government,
administering the gunman dictatorship of Chicago.
In 1928, the organized gunmen ot Chicago seized control
of the Chicago Coal Teamsters', Chauffeurs' and Helpers'
Union, local No. 704, and the Rackets entered a new phase,
that of economic terrorisation by the armed forces of the
Underworld.
In 1931, the New York Times of November 28 drew the
following picture of the gangster situation :
New York City has become the world's capital of the
racketeers, who " with the power of Tammany hookups,
reinforced with revolver bullets and sawed-off shotgun slugs "
are exacting an annual tribute of at least $ 600,000,000 here,
Fred D. Pasley, biographer of Al Capone, asserts in " Muscling In, " to be published today by Ives Washburn. Every
trade and business organization is racket-ridden, some of the
hardest hit groups being dealers in such foodstuffs as
1. Fred D. Pasley, Al Capone, p. 228.

THE

RACKETS

647

artichokes, flour, milk, fish and ice, the garment trades, the building
industry and the various branches of transportation, the author
declares.
Mr. Pasley's nation-wide survey pays special attention to Chicago
and New York. Crime, he reiterates, has become " big business, "
thoroughly organized in every large American city " with its various
racket departments—whether beer, booze, pretzels, gambling, vice
or the muscling in on industry and labor unions—as efficiently
administered as the units of a great corporation. " Instead of
diminishing, the power of the racketeers is increasing and " in
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York and other
American cities the gangster with his syndicate is in the racket
saddle in 1931 and riding high, wide and handsome. "
In Chicago the annual tribute exacted by racketeers amounts to $
200,000,000, Mr. Pasley says. The levy in Philadelphia is estimated
at $ 100,000,000, in Detroit $ 75,000,000, in Los Angeles $
50,000,000 and in Cleveland and Pittsburgh S 25,000,000 each. The
nation's annual crime bill is put at $ 1,119,000,000.
Asserting that the rise of the racketeer dates from the enactment
of prohibition, Mr. Pasley continues :
" Prohibition after twelve years is pouring into the coffers of the
Capones, the Maddens, the Gordons and the Duffys something like
$ 3,000,000,000 a year for the financing of their varied enterprises
and the maintaining of political relationships. The State laws which
they violated with impunity in their criminal operations were
ineffective against them, for it was the record that the only
convictions obtained, and these at excessive cost, were for
violations of a Federal statutef namely, income tax evasion. "
The author criticizes severely the practice of freeing gangsters on
bail while awaiting trial, contending that this allows the racketeer to
silence his enemies by murder, to bribe officials, and to use the
power of his organization to defeat justice in other ways.
But the term " Racketeering " does not apply only to the deeds of
American gangsters.
Besides the underworld vice rings, drug rings, bootleggers and
purveyors to the white slave traffic, we must

648

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

also recognise the existence of Economic and Financial
Rackets organized internationally on a huge scale.
To this category belong the International Foreign
Exchange and National Credit Ramps operating to control the
currencies of various countries for the benefit of a few "
Insiders ". Foreign Exchange gambling gains are not even
taxable and therefore constitute a doubly valuable racket. A
banker's racket!
The Stock Exchange Racket, whereby the invested
economies of the thrifty are siphoned out of their pockets into
those of the " Insiders " is another popular form of business
ramp. Stolen property being tax exempt, stock frauds yield a
high return. However we do not advocate taxing stock fraud
profits, we merely suggest that the law should provide for the
punishment of those criminals who operate such transactions.
Then there are the Tax Department, Income and Super Tax
Rackets. Should Racketeers gain control of the machinery of
government of a country and use its system of taxation as a
means of extorting and bleeding the taxpayer, such abuses are
none the less a racket! The Income and Super Tax Racket
conduces naturally to the extension of the operations of the
Stock Exchange fraudulent operator. The poor pay the tax.
Sometimes the rich pay it too. In any case, the honest pay for
the dishonest.
And what of the law ? People often have to wonder,
especially in the U. S. A., whether they can always go to law
solely on the basis of a just claim. Must they not sometimes
consider whether they will not be acting through a lawyer
who may have interests which are opposed to their own ? And
if there should be such a thing as a betrayal, need it always be
paid for in money ?
Again, we must not overlook the Social Racket, one

THE

RACKETS

649

of the most interesting examples of which is the now famous "
Douglas-Pennant Case ". From recent developments,
however, it would seem that this was largely a Masonic
intrigue. The Chairman of the House of Lords Committee
trying the case was the late Lord Kintore, a noted Freemason.
Others connected with the conspiracy to ruin Miss Violet
Douglas-Pennant's life and reputation were also Freemasons.
Nothing was ever proved against this lady and she herself
makes no mystery of the fact that she was, for a short time, a
member of a masonic organization, "The G. D. " She resigned
her membership in this body, however, shortly after her
initiation but from then onward was hounded and threatened
in every way. That her failure to gain Justice in an English
court is only a part of a policy of persecution will surprise few
of those who have followed her case.
The present wave of International Unemployment is
interesting as an Economic Racket. Already France, England
and the U. S. A. have been led to segregate their own workers
and exclude foreign labour. This course seemed a patriotic
necessity at the outset but the idea, exploited to its logical
conclusion, spells slavery of the workers. Nations decreeing
that only native labour can be employed within their
boundaries thus subtly rob labour of its freedom to work
where it commands the highest price and best conditions.
Labour, robbed of its right to control its own market, may
suddenly find itself restricted to even county boundaries. In
that event a condition will arise for which there is already an
historical precedent. Boris Goudounoff, through the creation
of just such a situation in Russia, instituted serfdom in a
country where, previously, the workers had been free men.
Italy, Australia and England have already enforced

650

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

virtual embargoes on capital — why not therefore
embargoes on labour ?
The Rackets are the last stage of the battle in the economic
war between Predatory Capitalism and Predatory Labour
against Constructive Capitalism and Constructive Labour.
The progressive stages of this war are outlined in a document
known as The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. 2 The full
significance of this record should have been made the subject
of a comprehensive course of studies in every school, church
and university, but whereas Marxism, which is but one of the
means devised for the accomplishment of the Protocols, is

THE NEW HISTORY SOCIETY
(Founded 1930)
This Society was founded on April 5, 1930, at a meeting at
The Park Lane Hotel, New York, presided over by Mirza
Ahmed Sohrab who read a resolution embodying the ideals of
Professor Einstein and Arthur Henderson which
was
unanimously adopted.
In Torchbearers (p. 32), a pamphlet published by The New
History Society in 1931, we read that Mr. Einstein has
declared the position he will take in the next war ;
" I should unconditionally refuse every direct or indirect
war service and try to induce my friends to take the same
stand, and this independently of any critical opinion of the
causes of the war. "
History is, or should be, the truth on past events. When it is
distortion of past records to suit the aims and convenience of
specific groups it is not history. There can be no such thing as
New History. We are therefore entitled to question the
historical basis of this society whose members are the "
advocates of the Universal Principles of Baha'u' llah and
spreaders of the Ideals of Abdul Baha. " 1

The direct result of another Mass meeting held on April 5
under the auspices of this society was the affiliation of twenty
Peace Societies under the name of " Youth Peace Federation
".
Among the members of this New History Society we find
the name of Besanta Koomar Roy.

THE YOUTH PEACE FEDERATION
(Founded 1930)
Early in the 20th Century the headquarters of The Worker,
the Communist weekly, were at 8 East 10th Street, New
York. It also harboured a " Youth Movement " imported
from Germany.
In a pamphlet issued by the Massachusetts Public Interest
League, (210 Newbury Street, Boston, Mass. April 1925) we
read that this " Youth Movement " was sponsored by The
National Student Forum, an organization " made up of those
elements in the colleges which have at different times called
themselves Inter-collegiate Socialist Societies, Liberal
Leagues and Leagues for Industrial Democracy. It was
Lenin's cleverness which suggested ' frequent changes of
name ' to radical organizations. This bewilders the public and
the new names serve as an alias. "
An article in the Survey Graphic for December 1921 stated
the aims of this movement to include advocation of the
Nudity Cult and promiscuity in sex relationships under the
name of free love. Its advocacy of Body worship enables us to
classify it as " Phallic ".
" It is the purpose of the National Student Forum ", writes
R. M. Whitney, in a pamphlet entitled The
653

654

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Youth Movement, " and the other organizations which it
supports by its sympathy, to undermine and sink, or
overthrow, the Government of the United States, and to set up
in this country a s( viet form of government, such as Russia
now boasts. " " Its constituent organizations are :
Barnard Social Science Club.
Bryn Mawr Liberal Club.
Dartmouth Round Table.
George Washington University Free Lance Club.
Harvard Student Liberal Club.
Hood College Contemporary Club.
Hollins (Virginia) Student Forum.
Howard (coloured) Student Progressive Club.
Mt. Holyoke Forum.
Miami University Law School Liberal Club.
Northwestern University Liberal League.
Oberlin College Liberal Club.
Park College Social Science Club.
Rockford College International Relations Club.

Stanford University Forum.
Swarthmore Polity Club.
University of Chicago Liberal Club.
University of Colorado Forum.
Union Theological Seminary Contemporary Club.
Vassar College Political Association.
Wellesley College Forum.
Western College Forum.
Yale Liberal Club ". l
The first executive Secretary of the National Student
Forum was Mr. John Rothschild, a New York Socialist.
Among others interested in the movement was

Society Inc. 154 Nassau Street. New York City.

THE YOUTH PEACE FEDERATION

655

" W. A. Robeson, an Englishman who had studied under
Harold Laski, the Radical who came into the limelight while
teaching at Harvard. " 2 Robeson was a member of the
Advisory Committee of the British Labour Party and a friend
of the well known Fabian, Mr. George Bernard Shaw.
In the New Student, the organ of the National Student
Forum of Dec. 2nd, 1922, Mr. George Bernard Shaw is
quoted as saying; — "As far as I can gather, if the students in
American Universities do not organize their own education,
they will not get any. The professors are overworked
schoolmasters, underpaid, and deprived of all liberty of
speech and conscience. From them nothing can be expected...
the remedy is cooperative organization by the consumers; that
is, by the students... In forming intellectual Soviets, and
establishing the Dictatorship of the Learner, the American
students may save their country, if it is capable of being saved.
If not, they will at least learn something, and perhaps teach
something, in the ecstasy of demolition. "
In a speech made in Moscow in June, 1923, Zinovieff
(Chairman of The Young Communist International
Movement) said : — " The Youth Movement is the best
section of the Communist International. " 3
In further corroboration of the tendencies of this
organisation to an " ecstasy of demolition ", Professor George
Leiken of the Volga region is further mentioned in the
pamphlet above referred to as saying : — " When the Russian
youth reaches the age of 12 the so-called League of
Communist Youth awaits him. This

organization accepts girls as well as boys and promptly
reduces them to a low state of moral corruption. The
institutions of marriage and home are ignored...
' Children are taught that they owe no obedience to parents,
that they need acknowledge no authority but the Red
Government. "
" It was W. Z. Foster, one of Moscow's cleverest agents,
who said : ' Communists get things done and paid for by
others. ' "
The Youth Peace Federation founded in 1930 is also to be
found at 8 East 10th Street, New York. Organized in April 14
1930 at the residence oi Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Stuyvesant
Chanler this society was founded at a mass meeting held
under the auspices of "The New History Society " on April 5,
1931. It is the collective name of the following associations :
—
Civic Club, Junior Group;
International Club ;
League of Youth of Community Church ;
Methodist Epworth League, New York District ;
New York Committee of the Fellowship of Reconciliation ;
Pioneer Youth of America;
Progressive Youth League of Bronx Free Fellowship ;
Seven Arts Club ;
The Peace Education Group of the Ethical Culture Society
of New York ;
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
(Junior Group);
Women's Peace Society (Junior Group);

The above organization is that familiar to any business
man of a Holding Corporation in which are joined subsidiary
companies.
Basing our deductions on the foregoing articles in this
book we conclude that the secret objectives of this
corporation may be :
Disarmament of all countries except Russia in order to
facilitate the rule of the World by the International Jewish
Super-Capitalist Group now dominating Russia with the Red
Army under its control, and the end of Democracy.
A basic principle of war strategy is to have your enemy
unprepared for assault.
The Massachusetts Public Interest League warns us that :
" The Youth Movement is using American Youth as a
pawn in the Communist game.
The real menace of the movement in this country (America)
lies in the fact that it is revolutionary propaganda in romantic
disguise subtly preaching to immature youth the ecstasy of
demolition of the foundations of civilization. "

THE INTERNATIONAL BANK
(Founded 1930)
The Internationalization of finance reached its apotheosis
when, on April 23 1930 the International Bank at Basle,
commissioned to enrol the central banks of nine nations in its
membership, was founded.
As for the delegates from the different countries attending
the meeting their names signify little for, owing to the speed
and unanimity with which official appointments were made,
it is evident that they were all instructed, or, in other words
pledged, to obey orders. By whom were the orders given ?
History may answer that question some day!
Mr. Gates McGarrah was elected chairman of the board of
directors with Mr. Leon Frazer his deputy and Sir Charles
Addis and Dr. Melchior were elected vice-chairmen.
The significance of this international institution was
commented upon in an article entitled " Mammon being
enthroned" by " Arthurian" in the Referee dated Sunday,
April 13, 1930, in the following terms which, while
constituting a warning to the English people, is actually an
appeal to the people of the world.
" One is amazed at the equanimity with which Sir Charles
Addis describes the difficulty of enabling
658

THE

INTERNATIONAL BANK

659

the Bank for International Settlements to avoid interference
with the Sovereign Rights of the people of each of so many
countries ! Surely the possibility alone ought to be adequate
condemnation of the bank. The opening for chicanery, brute
force, bribery, corruption and war, in the supposed solution
of this problem,
is unprecedented in the history of the world .............
" The Bank is to exist for fifty years, if it can ; it is to pay no
taxes during all that time ; and its assets and deposits are to be
immune from seizure, confiscation, and censorship, in peace
or war ; it is also to be subject to no restriction or prohibition
of any kind on its imports and exports of gold or currency. So
little do Government decisions regarding the Bank really
count that, before the scheme has been sanctioned, the first
part of the subscription has already been subscribed . The
Bankers and business men to be associated are to ensure that
there will be no uncertainty about the business that the Bank
will promote, the ' money troubles which lie at the root' of the
industrial depression and financial uncertainty are, of course,
going to be cured by them — so they say. The Governor of the
Bank of England (Mr Montagu Norman) is going to be a
director of this foreign Bank. What an honour ! This Board,
with the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people at its
mercy, is going to meet at least ten times a year — four times
at Basle... 'The Bank owes allegiance to no single
Government. ' It need keep no currency reserve...
"This Bank that owes no allegiance to anyone can do as it
likes,.... Mammon is enthroned upon the world, to make what
profits it can, with unrestricted powers, for fifty years ! In
addition to its extraordinary powers, it has control of the '
Machinery of Reparations ' which contains the means by
which the wherewithal

660

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

to liquidate Reparations can be squeezed out of the
receivers at a profit to the payers ..............Economic control
involves political control as well as every other control
of any people. Truly, the megalomania of finance never
went further, truly, there has never been anything
like it in the world before...........
" People of England ! Remember how the stranglehold of
the Rank of England on all the other banks, on all the other
financial houses, upon every business and upon every home
and family has grown from the comparatively negligible sum
of £1,200,000 of similar credit free of interest and the '
usufruct' thereof. This new usufruct will be the
impoverishment, debasement, extinction, and disintegration
of all that the masses of this country care for, and the certain
decline and fall and redistribution, into foreign hands, of the
Rritish Empire...
" In this country we have asked for the creation of
interest-free credit to be lent to the people to be used for the
production of wealth by and for the people, but by a great
conspiracy of silence the idea is being suppressed. The
hidden prize is not intended for us. Only those who have been
swindled on a race-course by three-card trick men can realize
what is now being done to all the peoples of the Allied
countries by a debased money and credit-upon-credit trick,
the like of which has never been attempted in the world
before...
" The alleged £ 80,000,000 per annum that Germany is
supposed to pay to the United States for fifty-nine years is a
delusion and a snare. Rut the aim of the section of Wall Street
repudiated by President Hoover, which initially promoted the
idea of the Plan (The Young Plan), is that, through Germany,
this section of Wall Street shall dominate the world. "
Note : Compare with The Protocols, (L. Fry, op. cit.)

CONCLUSION
The foregoing pages have had for object to show how,
whether open or secret, a great many societies, masonic and
non-masonic, of good or evil intent, seem to function towards
the same goal under centralized leadership.
This book claims to be an endeavour to prove that: —
1 — Owing to their union, all secret societies, whether
political, philanthropic or occult in appearance, serve
a political purpose unknown to the majority of their
members.
2 — The power wielded by such societies is real and
its character is international.
3 — Regardless of their exoteric objects, the esoteric
aims of most societies are all directed towards the
same end — namely : the concentration of political,
economic and intellectual power into the hands of a
small group of individuals, each of whom controls a
branch of the International life, material and spiritual,
of the world today.
The main branches thus controlled are :—
1 — The International Banking Groups and their
subsidiaries. 2 — International, industrial and commercial
control groups with their interlocking directorates.
661

662

OCCULT THEOCRASY

3 — Education, Art, Literature, Science, and Religion.
as vehicles of intellectual and moral perversion.
4 — The Groups already organized throughout different countries for the study of International affairs
political, financial and economic.
5 — The International Press, the medium used to
mould public opinion.
6 — The Political party organizations of each nation,
whether conservative, liberal, radical, socialist etc.
existing in every country with parliamentary
administration.
7 — Internationally organized corruption, the whiteslave traffic, vice and drug-rings, etc.
Any one of the branches above enumerated has
innumerable ramifications and the control of even the least of
them cannot be obtained without money. Money therefore
becomes one of the most powerful levers in the hands of men
who form the controlling groups. Thus does research in the
realm of Finance become indispensable to the students bent
upon tracing the real power behind universal control. This
power, they will find, is wholly in the hands of international
Jewish financiers.
Glancing at the body frame of all political organizations,
do we not perceive that MONEY is its main sinew ? It would
not sound preposterous to state that the electoral system is
similar to that of auction, insomuch as it favours the highest
bidder. In election campaigns, the successful candidate is not
necessarily the most deserving or worthy of votes, but too
frequently he who was able to buy the greater number of
votes. Votes are captured by slogans, propaganda and, not
unfre-quently, bribery. Only an infinitesimal percentage
among them will ever strive to find out the power or

CONCLUSION

663

powers behind the candidate, and by whom he is, in effect,
controlled.
Yet the importance of such an investigation is both obvious
and necessary, for it is a proven fact that candidates to
parliament in one country have sometimes been controlled by
a man, or group of men, in another country inimical to their
own.
If political control is international it must of necessity be
subversive of PATRIOTISM. If it holds in its power the reckless
forces of Socialism and Communism, it must be subversive
of social order and the promoter of revolution.
If spiritual control is anti-christian, Gnostic and occult, it
must be subversive of Christianity and Religion. If it directs
vice rings of all kinds, it must aim at the destruction of the
moral, intellectual and physical strength of the human Race.
If, in conclusion, Finance is Power and as such is
concentrated in one point, it is the arbiter of War and Peace,
Life and Death, Welfare and Wretchedness, Prosperity and
Ruin.
Everything and, it is sad to say, almost everybody, has a
price and can be bought though not always with money. Men
who to-day wield financial power have, long since based their
system of purchase on this axiom. Far be it from us to suggest
that there are no idealists in every walk of life for whom the
pursuit of either patriotism, religious mysticism or
philanthropy is unadulterated. On the contrary, we shall go as
far as to say that such people become the best tools in the
hands of plotters by whom they are led to believe that
disinterested material help will be given them for the
attainment of their ideals or aims. The study of secret
revolutionary societies will show many examples of
remarkable cases of self sacrifice on the part of genuine

664

OCCULT THEOCRASY

idealists. Subversives of either religious, social and political
order have ever known how to make use of such people by
instilling into them the super religion of the secret.
It is against this " secret " that the fight should be waged. If
the aims of secret societies are good, one fails to see the need
for their secret oaths and initiations. The "light " they promise
should, like the sun, shine upon everyone.
To use the words of Christ : " Who lighteth a candle and
putteth it under a bushel ? "
Masonic and secret societies need light.
Hence, Light should be thrown upon them from without
that their secrets may be revealed.
As to " Toleration " — indiscriminate toleration preached
at random, it should be considered one of the exoteric bases
upon which are erected subversive creeds.
Recognizing as they do the practical power of thought,
sects induce their novices to surrender their use of this power
whose normal function, guided by the individual conscience,
is to discriminate between good and evil in order to oppose
the latter. Thus they create a dangerous negative state of mind
as opposed to the Christian or positive. The individual when
robbed of his initiative can easily be swayed and guided by
the will of others. Therein resides the power of hypnotism
and in this wise the shibboleth of " toleration " which, in fact,
paralyses opposition to evil, serves an esoteric purpose
suspected by few.
If the contents of this book may help in safeguarding the
young and the unwary against falling into the pitfalls set by
agents of subversive sects, its author will not have laboured
in vain.
The work is far from being completed. It claims, in

CONCLUSION

665

fact, to be only an attempt in the direction of inexhaustible
research work upon the coordination of the aims of all
societies whether political or occult. It is to be hoped that
others, and may they be many, will begin work where this
book ends for —
" The harvest is great indeed but the labourers are few "

The names of women members are never divulged.
It is not lawful here to disclose the name of any living chief.
It was Karl Kellner who revived the exoteric organization of the 0.
T. 0. and initiated the plan now happily complete of bringing all
occult bodies again under one governance.
The letters 0. T. 0. represent the words Ordo Templi Orientis
(Order of the Temple of the Orient, or Oriental Templars), but they
have also a secret meaning for initiates.
3. The Order is international, and has existing branches in every
civilized country of the world.
4. The aims of the 0. T. 0. can only be understood fully by its
highest initiates ; but it may be said openly that it teaches Hermetic
Science or Occult Knowledge, the Pure and Holy Magick of Light,
the Secrets of Mystic attainment, Yoga of all forms, Gnana Yoga,
Raja Yoga, Bhakta Yoga and Hatha Yoga, and all other branches of
the secret Wisdom of the Ancients.
In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries ; its brain has resolved
all the problems of philosophy and of life.
It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of
Immortality, and of the Universal Medicine.
Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world-old
dream of the Brotherhood of Man.
It also possesses in every important centre of population a hidden
Retreat (Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum) where members may
conceal themselves in order to pursue the Great Work without
hindrance.

OCCULT THEOCRASY

These houses are secret fortresses of Truth, Light, Power and
Love, and their position is only disclosed under an oath of secrecy
to those entitled to make use of them.
They are also temples of true worship, specially consecrated by
Nature to bring out of a man all that is best in him.
5. The authority of the 0. T. 0. is concentrated in the
0. H. 0. (Outer Head of the Order), or Frater Superior.
The name of the Person occupying this office is never disclosed
except to his immediate representatives.
6. The Authority of the 0. H. 0. in all English-speaking countries
is delegated by charter to the Most Holy, Most Illustrious, Most
Illuminated and Most Puissant Baphomet X°, Rex Summus

9. Every man or woman that is of full age, free, and of
good report, has an indefeasible right to the III0.
Beyond this, admission is only granted by invitation from the
governing bodies concerned.
The 0. T. 0., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic
Body so far as the " secrets " are concerned in the sense in which
that expression is usually understood; and therefore in no way
conflicts with, or infringes the just privileges of, the United Grand
Lodge of England, or any Grand Lodge in America or elsewhere
which is recognized by it.
10. Application for admission to the Order may be made
personally at headquarters, between the hours of Ten a. m.
and Twelve Noon on week-days, or by letter to the Grand
Secretary General. In the former case, applicants should be
provided with the Twenty Dollars entitling them to the
Third Degree ; in the latter, it should be enclosed with the
application.
The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third
Degree ; if this is taken after June 30 in any year, only half the
amount is due.
Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but

682

the Brother is considered in good standing, and he does not lose his
rights, if it is paid by March 1. Should he fail to discharge his
obligation by this date, he ceases ipso facto to be a member of the
Order, but may be reinstated on paying arrears and Five Dollars
extra. If his lapse extend to the next year following, he can only be
reinstated under special conditions, and by the express consent in
writing of the National Grand Master General ad vitam.
11. The Constitution, Trust Deeds, Charters, Warrants and all
other documents, are exhibited to candidates on their exaltations to
the IV0, should they desire it.
12. Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas
for framing are granted to all members at a uniform price of Ten
Dollars.
Special diplomas of the IX0, Twenty-five Dollars.
13. The privileges of members of the 0. T. 0. are very
numerous. These are the principal;
1° They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole
body of hidden knowledge preserved in the Sanctuary from the
beginning of its manifestation.
In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted, and conveyed
in symbol, beneath veil, and through sacrament.
In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so
that he who uses the knowledge of the lower grades may be
selected for invitation to the higher, where all things are declared
openly.
2° They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in
Liberty, Beauty, Harmony, and Love which flames within the
heart of the 0. T. 0, and the Light of that august fraternity
insensibly illuminates them and more as they approach its central
Sun.
3° They meet those persons most complemental to their own
natures, and find unexpected help and brotherhood in the whole
world whereever they may travel.
4° They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the
0. T. 0., permanently or for a greater or

APPENDIX I

683

lesser period of the year according to their rank in the Order ; or,
in the case of those of the Fifth and lower degrees, are candidates
for invitation to these houses.
5° The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal
Medicine is restricted to members of the IX0 ; but it may be
administered to members of the VIII0 and VII0 in special
circumstances by favour of the National Grand Masters General,
and even in particular emergency to members of lower degrees.
6° In the V° all members are pledged to bring immediate and
perfect relief to all distress of mind, body, or estate, in which they
may find any of their fellows of that degree. In the higher degrees
the Bonds of Fraternity are still further strengthened. The Order
thus affords a perfect system of insurance against every
misfortune or accident of life.
7° Members of the IX0 become part proprietors of the Estates
and Goods of the Order, so that the attainment of this degree
implies a return with interest of the fees and subscriptions paid.
8° The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy
members of even its lower degrees, so that even if originally poor,
they become well able to afford the comparatively high fees of the
VII0, VIII0, and IX0.
On exaltation to the IV0 each Companion may file an account
of his circumstances, and state in what direction he requires help.
14. In selecting members for advancement, attention is paid to
their devotion to the Order, to their intelligence in apprehending the
nature of its teachings, to their zeal in spreading the principles of the
Order so far as they themselves understand them, though always
with the discretion inseparable from the due guarding of the secrets,
and to all those qualities of courage, honour, and virtue without
which man is not worthy of that name.
15. The 0. H. 0., is only known to members of the VIII0 and IX0.

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
It has been represented to UTS that some persons who are
worthy to join the 0. T. 0. consider the fees and subscriptions
rather high. This is due to your failure to explain properly the
great advantages offered by the Order. We desire you
therefore presently to note, and to cause to be circulated
throughout the Order, and among those of the profane who
may seem worthy to join it, these matters following concerning
the duties and the privileges of members of the earlier degrees
of the 0. T. 0. as regards material affairs. And for convenience
we shall classify these as pertaining to the Twelve Houses of
the Heaven, but also by
685

THEOCRASY

numbered clauses for the sake of such as understand not the
so-called Sciences of the Stars. First, therefore, concerning the
duties of the Brethren. Yet with our Order every duty is also a
privilege, so that it is impossible wholly to separate them.

ORDO

TEMPLI ORIENTIS

Of the duties of Brethren.
First House
1. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Yet it is
well for Brethren to study daily in the volume of the Sacred
Law, Liber Legis, for therein is much counsel concerning
this, how best they may carry out this will.
Second House
2. The private purse of every Brother should always be at the
disposal of any Brother who may be in need. But in such a case it is
a great mischief if the one ask, and the other consent; for if the
former be really in need, his pride is wounded by his asking ; and if
not, the door is opened to beggars and impostors, and all manner of
arrant knaves and rogues such as are no true Brethren. But the
Brother who is possessed of this world's goods should make it his
business to watch the necessity of all those Brethren with whom he
may be personally acquainted, anticipating their wants in so wise
and kindly and delicate a manner that it shall appear as if it were the
payment of a debt. And what help is given shall be given with
discretion, so that the relief may be permanent instead of temporary.
3. All Brethren shall be exceedingly punctual in the payment of
Lodge Dues. This is to take precedence of all other calls upon the
purse.
687

688

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

Third House
The Brethren shall be diligent in preaching the Law of Thelema.
In all writings they shall be careful to use the prescribed greetings ;
likewise in speech, even with strangers.
5. They shall respond heartily to every summons of the Lodge or
Chapter to which they may belong, not lightly making excuse.
6. Brethren should use every opportunity of assisting each other
in their tastes, businesses, or professions, whether by direct dealing
with Brethren in preference to others, or as may suggest itself. It
seems desirable, when possible, that where two or more Brethren of
the same Lodge are engaged in the same work, they should seek to
amalgamate the same by entering into partnership. Thus in time
great and powerful corporations may arise from small individual
enterprisfs.
7. They shall be diligent in circulating all tracts, manifestos, and
all other communications which the Order may from time give out
for the instruction or emancipation of the profane.
8. They may offer suitable books and pictures to the Libraries of
the Profess-Houses of the Order.
Fourth House
9. Every Brother who may possess mines, land, or houses
more than he cam himself occupy, should donate part of
such mines or land, or one or more of such houses to the
Order.
10. Property thus given will be administered if he desire
it in his own interest, thus effecting a saving, since large
estates are more economically handled than small. But the
Order will use such property as may happen to lie idle for
the moment in such ways as it may seem good, lending an
unlet house (for example) to some Brother who is in need,
or allowing an unused hall to be occupied by a Lodge.

APPENDIX

I

689

11. (Yet in view of the great objects of the Order, endowment is
welcome.)
12. Every Brother shall show himself solicitous of the comfort
and happiness of any Brother who may be old, attending not only to
all material wants, but to his amusement, so that his declining years
may be made joyful.
Fifth

Home

13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all
Brethren with whom he is acquainted, whether by entertainment or
conversation, or in any other manner that may suggest itself. It will
frequently and naturally arise that love itself springs up between
members of the Order, for that they have so many and so sacred
interests in common. Such love is peculiarly holy, and is to be
encouraged.
14. All children of Brethren arc to be considered as children of
the whole Order, and to be protected and aided in every way by its
members severally, as by its organization collectively. No
distinction is to be made with regard to the conditions surrounding
the birth of any child.
15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother
should fulfil, with regard to all children, those born without the
Order included. This duty is to instruct them in the Law of Thelema,
to teach them independence and freedom of thought and character,
and to warn them that servility and cowardice are the most deadly
diseases of the human soul.
Sixth House
16. Personal or domestic attendants should be chosen from
among the members of the Order when possible, and great tact and
courtesy are to be employed in dealing with them.
17. They, on their part, will render willing and intelligent
service.
18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be
treated as Brothers, with perfect equality ; such beha-

690

OCCULT THEOCRASY

viour is undesirable during the hours of service, and familiarity,
subversive as it is of all discipline and order, is to be avoided by
adopting a complete and marked change of manner and address.
19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not
to the Brethren Servient in the Profess-Houses of the Order, who,
giving service without recompense, are to be honoured as hosts.
20. In case of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all
Brethren who know him personally to attend him, to see that he
want for nothing, and to report if necessary his needs to the Lodge,
or to Grand Lodge itself.
21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will
naturally give their skill and care with even more than their
customary joy in service.
22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service in
their particular trade, business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge.
For example, a stationer will supply the Grand Lodge with paper,
vellum, and the like ; a bookseller offer any books to the Library of
Grand Lodge which the Librarian may desire to possess ; a lawyer
will execute any legal business for Grand Lodge, and a railway or
steamship owner or director see to it that the Great Officers travel in
comfort wherever they may wish to go.
23. Visitors from other Lodges are to be accorded the treatment
of ambassadors ; this will apply most especially to Sovereign Grand
Inspectors General of the Order on their tours of inspection. All
hospitality and courtesy shown to such is shown to Ourselves, not to
them only.
Seventh House
24. It is desirable that the marriage partner of any Brother should
also be a member of the Order. Neglect to insist upon this leads
frequently to serious trouble for both parties, especially for the
uninitiate.
25. Lawsuits between members of the Order are absolutely
forbidden, on pain of immediate expulsion and loss

APPENDIX I

691

of all privileges, even of those accumulated by past good conduct
referred to in the second part of this instruction.
26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to
the Master or Masters of their Lodge or Lodges in conference ; if a
composition be not arrived at in this manner, the dispute is to be
referred to the Grand Tribunal, which will arbitrate thereon, and its
decision is to be accepted as final.
27. Refusal to apply for or to accept such decision shall entail
expulsion from the Order, and the other party is then at liberty to
seek his redress in the Courts of Profane Justice.
28. Members of the Order are to regard those without its pale as
possessing no rights of any kind, since they have not accepted the
Law, and are therefore, as it were, troglodytes, survivals of a past
civilisation, and to be treated accordingly. : Kindness should be
shown towards them, as towards any other animal; and every effort
should be made to bring them into Freedom.
29. Any injury done by any person without the Order to any
person within it may be brought before the Grand Tribunal, which
will, if it deem right and fit, use all its power to redress or to avenge
it.
30. In the case of any Brother being accused of an offence against
the criminal law of the country in which he resides, so that any other
Brother cognisant of the fact feels bound in self-defence to bring
accusation, he shall report the matter to the Grand Tribunal as well
as to the Civil Authority, claiming exemption on this ground.
31. The accused Brother will, however, be defended by the Order
to the utmost of its power on his affirming his innocence upon the
Volume of the Sacred Law in the Ordeal appointed ad hoc by the
Grand Tribunal itself.
1. Compare with Schulchan Aruch and Talmud where non-Jews are as
animals to the Jews.

692

OCCULT THEOCRASY

32. Public enemies of the country of any Brother shall
be treated as such while in the field, and slain or captured
as the officer of the Brother may command. But within the
precincts of the Lodge all such divisions are to be forgotten
absolutely; and as children of One Father the enemies of
the hour before and the hour after are to dwell in peace,
amity, and fraternity.
Eighth House
33. Every Brother is expected to bear witness in his last will and
testament to the great benefit that he hath received from the Order
by bestowing upon it part or the whole of his goods, as he may deem
fit.
34. The death of a Brother is not to be occasion of melancholy,
but of rejoicing; the Brethren of his Lodge shall gather together and
make a banquet with music and dancing and all manner of gladness.
It is of the greatest importance that this shall be done, for thereby the
inherited fear of death which is deep-rooted as instinct in us will
gradually be rooted out. It is a legacy from the dead aeon of Osiris,
and our children's children may be born free from the curse.
Ninth House
35. Every Brother is expected to spend a great part of
his spare time in the study of the principles of the Law and
of the Order, and in searching out the key to its great and
manifold mysteries.
36. He should also do all in his power to spread the Law,
especially taking long journeys, when possible, to remote
places, there to sow the seed of the Law.
Tenth House
37. All pregnant women are especially sacred to members
of the Order, and no effort should be spared to bring them to
acceptance of the Law of Freedom, so that the unborn may
benefit by that impression. They should be induced to

APPENDIX

I

693

become members of the Order, so that the child may be born under
its aegis.
38. If the mother that is to be have asserted her will to be so in
contempt and defiance of the Tabus of the slave-gods, she is to be
regarded as specially suitable to our Order, and the Master of the
Lodge in her district shall offer to become, as it were, godfather to
the child, who shall be trained specially, if the mother so wishes, as
a servant of the Order, in one of its Profess-Houses.
39. Special Profess-Houses for the care of women of the Order,
or those whose husbands or lovers are members of the Order, will
be instituted, so that the frontal duty of womankind may be carried
out in all comfort and honour.
40. Every Brother is expected to use all his influence with
persons in a superior station of life (so called) to induce them to join
the Order. Royal personages, ministers of State, high officials in the
Diplomatic, Naval, Military, and Civil Services are particularly to
be sought after, for it is intended ultimately that the temporal power
of the State be brought into the Law, and led into freedom and
prosperity by the application of its principles.
41. Colleges of the Order will presently be established where the
children of its members may be trained in all trades, businesses, and
professions, and there they may study the liberal arts and humane
letters, as well as our holy and arcane science. Brethren are expected
to do all in their power to make possible the establishment of such
Universities.
Eleventh House
42. Every Brother is expected to do all in his power to
induce his personal friends to accept the Law and join the
Order. He should therefore endeavour to make new friends
outside the Order, for the purpose of widening its scope.

694

OCCULT THEOCRASY

Twelfth House
43. The Brethren are bound to secrecy only with regard to the
nature of the rituals of our Order, and to our words signs, etc. The
general principles of the Order may be fully explained, so far as they
are understood below the VI0 ; as it is written, " The ordeals I write
not : the rituals shall be half known and half concealed; the Law is
for all. " It is to be observed that punctual performance of these
duties, so that the report thereof is noised abroad and the fame of it
cometh even unto the Throne of the Supreme and Holy King
himself will weigh heavily in the scale when it comes to be a
question of the high advancement of a Brother in the Order.

Of The Privileges of the Brethren.
First House
44. The first and greatest of all privileges of a Brother
is to be a Brother ; to have accepted the Law, to have become
free and independent, to have destroyed all fear, whether
of custom, or of faith, or of other men, or of death itself.
In other papers the joy and glory of those who have accepted
the Book of the Law as the sole rule of life is largely, though
never fully, explained ; and we will not here recapitulate
the same.
Second House
45. All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right
to the direct assistance of the Order up to the full amount
of fees and subscriptions paid by them up to the time of
application. This will be regarded as a loan, but no interest
will be charged upon it. That this privilege may not be
abused, the Grand Tribunal will decide whether or no such
application is made in good faith.

APPENDIX

I

695

Third House
46. Members of the Order will be permitted to use the Library in
any of our Profess-Houses.
47. Circulating Libraries will presently be established.
48. Brethren who may be travelling have a right to the
hospitality of the Master of the Lodge of the district for a period of
three days.
Fourth House
49. Brethren of all grades may be invited to sojourn in the
Profess-Houses of the Order by Grand Lodge : and such invitation
may confidently be expected as the reward of merit. There they will
be able to make the personal acquaintance of members of the higher
Grades, learn of the deeper workings of the Order, obtain the benefit
of personal instruction, and in all ways fit themselves for
advancement.
50. In the higher degrees Brethren have the right to reside in our
Profess-Houses for a portion of every year, as shown : —
VI0
Two weeks.
G. T.
One month.
P. B. S. Six weeks.

VII0 Two months.
S. G. C.Three months.
VIII0 Six months.

52. Members of the IX0, who share among themselves
the whole property of the Order according to the rules of
that degree, may, of course, reside there permanently. Indeed,
the house of every Brother of this grade is, ipso facto, a
Profess-House of the Order.
Fifth House
53. All Brethren may expect the warmest cooperation in
their pleasures and amusements from other members of the
Order. The perfect freedom and security afforded by the
Law allows the characters of all Brethren to expand to the
very limits of their nature, and the great joy and gladness
with which they are constantly overflowing make them the

696

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

best of companions. " They shall rejoice, our chosen; who
sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and
delicious languor, force and fire, are of us. "
54. Children of all Brethren are entitled to the care of the Order,
and arrangements will be made to educate them in certain of the
Profess-Houses of the Order.
55. Children of Brethren who are left orphans will be officially
adopted by the Master of his Lodge, or if the latter decline, by the
Supreme Holy King himself, and treated in all ways as if they were
his own.
56. Brethren who have a right to some especial interest in any
child whose mother is not a member of the Order may recommend
it especially to the care of their lodge or of Grand Lodge.
Sixth House
57. In sickness all Brethren have the right to medical or surgical
care and attendance from any Brethren of the Lodge who may be
physicians, surgeons, or nurses.
58. In special necessity the Supreme Holy King will send his
own attendants.
59. Where circumstances warrant it, in cases of lives of great
value to the Order and the like, he may even permit the
administration of that secret Medicine which is known to members
of the IX0.
60. Members of the Order may expect Brethren to busy
themselves in finding remunerative occupation for them, where they
lack it ; or, if possible, to employ them personally.
Seventh House
61. Members of the Order may expect to find suitable
marriage partners in the extremely select body to which
they belong. Community of interest and hope being already
established, it is natural to suppose that where mutual
attraction also exists, a marriage will result in perfect hap
piness. (There are special considerations in this matter which
apply to the VII0 and cannot be discussed in this place.)

APPENDIX

I

697

62. As explained above, Brethren are entirely free of
most legal burdens, since lawsuits are not permitted within
the Order, and since they may call upon the legal advisers
of the Order to defend them against their enemies in case of
need.
Eighth House
63. All Brethren are entitled after death to the proper disposal of
their remains according to the rites of the Order and their grade in it.
64. If the Brother so desire, the entire amount of the fees and
subscriptions which he has paid during his life will be handed over
by the Order to his heirs and legatees. The Order thus affords an
absolute system of insurance in addition to its other benefits.
Ninth House
65. The Order teaches the only perfect and satisfactory
system of philosophy, religion, and science, leading its mem
bers step by step to knowledge and power hardly even
dreamed of by the profane.
66. Brethren of the Order who take long journeys overseas
are received in places where they sojourn at the ProfessHouses of the Order for the period of one month.
Tenth House
67. Women of the Order who are about to become mothers
receive all care, attention, and honour from all Brethren.
68. Special Profess-Houses will be established for their
convenience, should they wish to take advantage of them.
69. The Order offers great social advantages to its members,
bringing them as it does into constant association with men and
women of high rank.
70. The Order offers extraordinary opportunities to its members
in their trades, businesses, or professions, aiding them by
co-operation, and securing them clients or customers.

698

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

Eleventh House
71. The Order offers friendship to its members, bringing
together men and women of similar character, taste, and
aspiration.
Twelfth House
72. The secrecy of the Order provides its members with an
inviolable shroud of concealment.
73. The crime of slander, which causes so great a proportion of
human misery, is rendered extremely dangerous, if not impossible,
within the Order by a clause in the Obligation of the Third Degree.
74. The Order exercises its whole power to relieve its members
of any constraint to which they may be subjected, attacking with
vigour any person or persons who may endeavour to subject them
to compulsion, and in all other ways aiding in the complete
emancipation of the Brethren from aught that may seek to restrain
them from doing That Which They Will.
It is to be observed that these privileges being so vast, it is
incumbent upon the honour of every Brother not to abuse them, and
the sponsors of any Brother who does so, as well as he himself, will
be held strictly to account by the Grand Tribunal. The utmost
frankness and good faith between Brethren is essential to the easy
and harmonious working of our system, and the Executive Power
will see to it that these are encouraged by all possible means, and
that breach of them is swiftly and silently suppressed.
Love is the Law, Love under will.
Our fatherly benediction, and the Blessing of the All-Father in
the Outer and the Inner be upon you.

Intimation with reference to the Constitution of the Order.
Any province of the 0. T. 0. is governed by the Grand Master and
those to whom he delegates his authority, until such time as the
Order is established, which is the case when it possesses eleven or
more Prof ess-Houses in the province. Then the regular constitution
is automatically promulgated. The quotation is slightly adapted
from an address in one of the rituals.
" This is the Constitution and Government of our Holy Order ; by
the study of its Balance you may yourself come to apprehension of
how to rule your own. life. For, in True Things, all are but images
one of another ; man is but a map of the universe, and Society is but
the same on a larger scale.
" Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades ; as it
is written in the Book of the Law : The Hermit, The Lover, and the
Man of Earth.
" It is but for convenience that these grades have been separated
into Three Triads.
" The Third Triad consists of the degrees from Minerval to Prince
of Jerusalem. The Minerval degree is a Prologue to the First ; the
degrees subsequent to the Third but pendants to it. In this, the Man
of Earth series, there are then but Three Degrees ; and these Three
are One.
" The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the
Order ; for he is not yet called upon to give his life to
1. Op. cit, p. 241.

699

700

it in service ; and with us Government is Service, and nothing else.
The Man of Earth is therefore in much the position of the Plebeian
in Rome in the time of Menenius Agrippa. But there is this marked
difference ; that every Man of Earth is encouraged and expected to
push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the general
body may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons,
two men and two women, from among themselves, to stand
continually before the face of the Father, the Supreme and Holy
King, serving him day and night. These persons must not be of
higher rank than the Second Degree ; they must volunteer for this
service at the conclusion of that ceremony ; and therefore they give
up their own prospect of advancement in the Order for one year,
that they may serve their fellows. This is then the first lesson in our
great principle, the attainment of honour through renunciation.
" The degree of Knights of the East and West is but a bridge
between the first and second series ; but it is important, for in that
grade a new pledge-form must be signed, and the new Knight
vowed to devote his life to the Establishment of the Law of
Thelema.
" The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that
concerns the Social welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically
that of beauty and harmony ; it is the natural stopping-place of the
majority of men and women ; for to proceed farther, as will appear,
involves renunciation of the. sternest kind. Here then all is joy,
peace, well-being on all planes ; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is
attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms a natural
link between them.2 Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on
high !
" In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will
appoint a committee of four persons, two men and two women, to
arrange for all social gatherings, banquets, dances, the performance
of plays, and similar pleasures. They

Rose Croix is formed of two opposite characters of men, good and evil, thus
accounting for the contradictory statements made about Rosicrucianism. (Author's
note).

701

will also endeavour to promote harmony among the Brethren in all
possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendliness
without formal appeal being made to any more authoritative
tribunal.
" The next grade, that which lies between the Fifth and Sixth
Degrees, is called the Senate. This is the first of the governing
bodies, properly speaking, and here we begin to insist upon
Renunciation. For within this body is the Electoral College of the 0.
T. 0.
" The principle of popular election is a fatal folly; its results are
visible in every so-called democracy. The elected man is always the
mediocrity ; he is the safe man, the sound man, who displeases the
majority less than any other; and therefore never the genius, the man
of progress and illumination.
" This electoral college consists of Eleven Persons in each
country. It has full control of the affairs of the Men of Earth,
appointing Lodge Masters at will. It has however no authority over
the Chapters of Rose Croix.
" Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the
Supreme and Holy King must volunteer for the office. The
appointment is for Eleven Years. Volunteers must renounce for that
period all further progress in the Order. They must give evidence of
first-rate ability in
1. Some branch of athletics.
2. Some branch of learning.
" They must also possess a profound general knowledge of
history and of the art of government, with some attention to
philosophy in general.
" They must each live in solitude, without more than the
necessary speech even to casual neighbors, serving themselves in all
respects, for three months continuously, once at least in every two
years. The President will summon them at the four seasons of the
year, and if necessary at other times, when they will deliberate upon
the affairs placed in their charge. All applications to pass to the Fifth
Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal from their decisions
may however be made to the Supreme Council.

702

OCCULT

THEOCRASY

" The Sixth Degree is an executive or military body, and
represents the temporal power of the Supreme and Holy King. Each
member is amenable to military discipline. Singly or in concert
with his comrades, each Knight is vowed to enforce the decisions of
authority.
" The Grade of Grand Inquisitor Commander follows. Here every
member has the right to a seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body
decides all disputes and complaints which have not been composed
by the Chapter of Rose Croix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are
without appeal, unless a member of the Electoral College give
sanction to take the case to the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree. All
members of the Order, even of higher grades, are subject to the
Grand Tribunal.
" The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every
member of this degree is devoted to the Propagation of the Law in a
very special manner ; for this grade is the first in which the
Beginning of the Inmost Secret is declared openly. He will therefore,
by his personal exertions, induce one hundred and eleven persons to
join the Order, before he may proceed to the Seventh Degree, except
by special order from the Supreme and Holy King.
" The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great General
Staff of the Army of the Sixth Degree. From its members the
Supreme and Holy King appoints a Supreme Grand Council.
" This Council is charged with the government of the whole of
the Second Triad, or Lovers. All members of the Seventh Degree
travel as Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Order, and
report, on their own initiative, to the Supreme and Most Holy King,
as to the condition of all Lodges and Chapters ; to the Supreme
Council, on all affairs of the Second Triad; and to the Electoral
College, on those of the third.
" The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. Its members being
fully instructed in the Principles of the Order, save in one point only,
devote themselves to the understanding of what they have learned in
their initiation. They have power to reverse the decisions of the
Grand Tribunal, and to com-

APPENDIX I

703

pose all conflicts between any of the governing bodies. And this they
do upon the great principles of philosophy. For it will often occur
that there is contention between two parties, both of whom are right
from their own point of view. This is so important that an illustration
is desirable. A man is smitten with leprosy : is it right that men
should circumscribe his liberty by isolating him from his fellows ?
Another holds back land or some other necessity from common use ;
is he to be compelled to surrender it ? Such cases of difficulty
involve deep philosophical principles ; and the Areopagus of the
Eighth Degree is charged with the duty of resolving them in
accordance with the great principles of the Order.
" Before the face of the Areopagus stands an independent
Parliament of the Guilds. Within the Order, irrespective of grade,
the members of each craft, trade, science, or profession form
themselves into a Guild, make their own laws, and prosecute their
own good, in all matters pertaining to their labour and means of
livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminent in it to
represent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree ; and all
disputes between the various Guilds are argued before that Body,
which will decide according to the grand principles of the Order. Its
decisions pass for ratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and
thence to the Throne.
" Epopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live in
isolation for four consecutive months in every year, meditating the
mysteries revealed to them.
" The Ninth Degree — the Sanctuary of the Gnosis — is synthetic.
The prime duty of its members is to study and practice the theurgy
and thaumaturgy of the grade ; but in addition they must be prepared
to act as direct representatives of the Supreme and Most Holy King,
radiating his light upon the world. Yet, from the nature of their
initiation, they must veil their glory in a cloud of darkness. They
move unseen and unrecognized among the youngest of us, subtly
and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries of the True
Light.
" The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the

704

OCCULT THEOCRASY

0. H. 0. His is the ultimate responsibility for all within his holy
kingdom. The succession to the high office of 0. H. 0. is decided in a
manner not here to be declared; but this you may learn, 0 Brother
Magician, that he may be chosen even from the grade of a Minerval.
And herein lieth a most sacred Mystery.
" The Electoral College possesses one most singular power.
Every eleven years, or in case of a vacancy occurring, they choose
two persons from the Ninth Degree, who are charged with the duty
of Revolution.
" It is the business of these persons constantly to criticise and
oppose the acts of the Supreme and Most Holy King, whether or no
they personally approve of them. Should he exhibit weakness,
bodily, mental, or moral, they are empowered to appeal to the 0. H.
0. to depose him; but they, alone of all the members of the Order,
are not eligible to the Succession.
" 0. H. 0., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act, in such
an emergency, as he may see fit. He may himself be removed from
office, but only by the unanimous vote of all members of the Tenth
Degree.
" Of the Eleventh Degree, its powers, privileges, and qualifications, nothing whatever is said in any grade. It has no relation
to the general plan of the Order, is inscrutable, and dwells in its own
Palaces.
" There are certain important financial obligations in various
grades.
" The Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All
property, earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the
Grand Treasurer General. The members subsist on the charity of the
Order, which is extended to them in accordance with their original
rank in life.
" These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council,
and all higher degrees.
" In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real
property in the Order ; and no one is admitted to this grade without
this preliminary.
" Those members of the Order who have given all to it

APPENDIX

I

705

must obtain the money for their initiation fees and subscriptions
from the Third Triad, whose honour is thus concerned in the
unselfish support of those who have abandoned all for their sakes.
" The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and
Most Holy King; he may be a member of any grade whatever ; but
he must, on accepting office, take the vow of poverty. His authority
is absolute in all financial matters ; but he is responsible to, and may
be removed at will by, the Supreme and Most Holy King. He will
appoint a committee to assist him and advise him in his work; and he
will usually select one person from each of the governing bodies of
the Order.
" Such is a brief outline of the government of the 0. T. 0. It
combines monarchy with democracy; it includes aristocracy, and
conceals even the seeds of revolution, by which alone progress can
be effected. Thus we balance the Triads, uniting the Three in One ;
thus we gather up all the threads of human passion and interest, and
weave them into an harmonious tapestry, subtly and diligently with
great art, that our Order may seem an ornament even to the Stars that
are in the Heavens at Night. In our rainbow-coloured texture we set
forth the glory of the whole Universe — See thou to it, brother
Magician, that thine own thread be strong, and pure, and of a colour
brilliant in itself, yet ready to mingle in all beauty with those of thy
brethren 1 "

" The order demands the immediate enforcement of the D .*. M.-.

" At different epochs of the life of the nations which have the
good fortune of possessing an active Supreme Council, and from
1820 onwards, certain similar communications have been made to
certain chosen members of the Grand Consistories and Supreme
Councils respectively. It is necessary to give the secret of this order.

1. Destruction of Supernaturalism, there where the Conscience
has not been reached by Masonic Materialism.
2. The Destruction of Authority, there where Education has not
been reached by Masonic Materialism.
3. The Destruction of Anti-Masonry, there where the state has
not been reached by Masonic Materialism.

but the veil of superstition was
thrown over them; it was deemed
politic or profitable to the few to
deceive the many; that which should
have been a simple record of fact
was worked up into an allegory;)
there arose an esoteric doctrine for
those initiated in the secrets of the
temple, and a de-ceptious exoteric
doctrine for the multitude; and this
was the origin of a priesthood... "
APRON

THE WIDOW

The Masonic leather apron
does not perpetuate the mem-| ory
of the apron of the artisan masons of
the middle ages. Its origin must be
looked for in the attire of the Grand
Priest, intended to hide his nudity
when he mounted the steps of the
altar.
In other words it corresponds to
the linen drawers which, according
to the prescription of Exodus,
xxviii, 42, should cover his loins. It
represents a sort of symbolical
circumcision.

The Sword is used by the
medium (Grand Master, Grand

directs the ceremonies of evocation
only in dealing with those spirits of
fire belonging to the higher degrees
of the infernal hierarchy.
There are two kinds of magic
pentagrams, one for lesser, and the
other for greater evocations. The
first is a five pointed star set with
precious stones, the second is a
similar star engraved with many
symbolic figures set upon a disc
which bears the letters D 0 M A G,

The Hindus adore the Lotus for
other reasons ; for example, because
being able to reproduce itself
without the assistance of the male
pollen, it is a type of the
androgynous or hermaphroditic
character of the Deity. For the same
reason this plant was also held
sacred by (the Egyptian priests.
