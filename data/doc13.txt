You are a terror to the 
unlawful foolishness of the world; you burn in the <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of God’s son; you are eager to win <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> for the banner of 

the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Cross to fight wars in the Christian army against the fury of the pagans. 2 Father, I ask you, by the 
living God, to attend to my questions. 

I am very concerned by this vision which has appeared to me in the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of mystery, for I have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> seen it 
with the external eyes of the flesh. I who am miserable and more than miserable in my womanly existence have 
seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> wonders <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> I was a child.

Most gentle Father, you are secure; in your goodness please answer me, your unworthy servant, for <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> I 
was a child I have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> felt secure, not for a single hour! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Could</span> you search your soul, in your piety and wisdom,

unable to raise myself up. So I am sad, I lament before you: I am unstable with the movement of the wooden 
beam of the wine-press in my nature, the beam which grew at the prompting of the devil from the root in Adam 

(for which he was cast out as a wanderer in this exile wo rid). 5 But now I raise myself up, I run to you, I speak to 
you. You are not unstable, you ease the pressure of the wooden beam, you gain the victory in your soul! And it is

2. The Action of the Will (from Scivias I, 4) 


In a series of images based on her concept of ‘greenness’, this digression in the middle o/Scivias 1, 4 presents 
some of Hildegard’s ideas on anthropology. Perhaps written before the letter to Bernard, it has been compared 
to writings by Hugh of St Victor and Honorius ofAutun and reveals how widely read she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have been,

Hildegard describes her understanding of such ideas as the relation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> understanding

3. Redemption (Scivias II, 1 ) 


In a version of the creation, the fall of Adam, and the redemption of humanity, Hildegard presents the story of 
her vision in a series of mysterious pictures. The <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of God, for instance, is seen as a shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with a 
flame the ‘colour of air, and the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of the cosmos takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when a dark sphere of air representing the 
basic matter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into contact with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and illumined with light. Later, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> 
merges with the brightness of the dawn on earth, the dawn being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of the Incarnation, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of 
redemption centres on the appearance of a ‘light-filled man’. In the original illustration to the scene, preserved 
in the Rupertsberg manuscript (see Introduction I. i), the ‘light-filled man’ is a reddish golden figure 
surrounded by large golden flames above his head and emerging from a red and golden circle, presumably the 
dawn, at the bottom of the picture. 


Scivias, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Part</span> II, Vision 1 


And I, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being, <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> ablaze with the strength of strong lions nor learned in their exhalations , 1 
remaining in the fragility of the weaker rib, but filled with mystical inspiration, saw: a shining fire, 
unfathomable, inextinguishable, fully alive and existing full of life; with a flame the colour of the air, brightly 
burning in the gentle breeze, and as inseparable from the shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being is inseparable from his 
inner organs. And I saw the shining flame glow white. And suddenly a dark sphere of air appeared, huge in size, 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the shining flame struck <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> blows, and at each blow a spark flew up so that soon the circle of air 
was <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to completion, and <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> shone <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in the fullness of perfection. The burning flame of 
heat moved towards a small clump of muddy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> lying on the circle of the ball of air. And it heated the clump 
of earth, turning it to flesh and blood, and breathing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into it so that it rose up as a living man. Once this was 
done, the shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with its flame burning bright in the gentle breeze offered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> a brilliant white flower

not taste it with his mouth or touch it with his hands. And he turned <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> and fell into thick darkness from 
which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not raise himself up. But the darkness grew and spread further and further across the air. Then 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> large stars appeared in the darkness, combining in their brightness, and after them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> others, small and 
large, shining in high splendour. Finally a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> star appeared, radiating marvellous clarity and directing its 
splendour towards the aforesaid flame. But on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> a brightness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the dawn appeared, merging with the 
flame in a marvellous manner but nevertheless not becoming separated from the shining fire. And in this way, 
in the brightness of the dawn, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> will was kindled. 

But when I tried to consider more closely the kindling of that will, I was opposed by a secret seal on the 

vision, - and I heard a voice speak to me from on high: ‘Of this mystery you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> any more than is

And I saw a light-filled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerge^ from the aforesaid dawn and pour his brightness over the

contact, and standing up, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> out of the darkness.

utmost heights of immeasurable glory, where he shone out wondrously in the fullness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> fragrance and

And I heard a voice speaking to me from the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> I have mentioned: Insignificant earthly creature!

4* Letter to Odo of Soissons 


This letter is a classic example of Hildegard’s willingness and ability, through the ‘living light’ as she <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> it, to 
participate in the scholastic controversies of her day. Odo, a theologian and master at Paris, heard of 
Hildegard at the Synod of Trier (1147-8) and wrote to ask her opinion of Gilbert Porreta’s statements on the 
Trinity, which were discussed at the Council ofRheims in 1148 (for Odo’s letter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> 32 below). In his thinking, 
Gilbert had sought to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a real distinction between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and the godhead.

Hildegard uses imagery to explain the mysteries of the Trinity should be compared with her letter to Odo of 
Soissons (4) on the same subject.

8. Letter to Hartwig of Bremen

Where am I in my exile? 1 In the shadow of death. What is this path I am walking on? The path of error. And 
what comfort do I have? The comfort of pilgrims. 

I was to have had a tent, a tabernacle 2 decorated with five square stones that shone brighter than the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> and 
the stars. And the stones were to shine not with the rising <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> and stars but with the glory of the angels. Its 

foundations were to be topaz, with gemstones^ for its roof and walls. Its steps were to be covered with crystal 
and its streets paved with gold. I was to be the companion of angels! 

For I am the living breath4 which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> breathed into the dry dust of the earth.

But what misfortune! When the tent of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> realized that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> cast its eyes in all directions it pitched 

itself towards the north. 5 Abomination! There I was captured and robbed of my sight and joy of knowledge. All

Oh Zion, my mother, when I remember how I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have dwelt with you, then I look at this bitter captivity 

into which I have been thrown! And when I recall all the harmonies of music9 <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> you, then I can only 
consider my wounds. And when I remember the joys and delights of your glory, then I curse these poisons with 
which they are polluted. 


Where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I turn? Where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I run to? My pain is immeasurable, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> if I remain in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> plight, I will 
be a companion to them - the ones I knew shamefully in the country of Babylon. Where are you, Zion my 
mother? What misfortune! If only I had not left you! I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> bear this pain more easily if I did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> you. 

Now I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> flee these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> companions! Wretched Babylon has loaded me with weights of lead; she oppresses 
me with heavy timbers so that I can scarcely breathe. But when I cry out to you, my mother, in my tears, 
wretched Babylon pours <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> a crashing sound of rushing waters so that you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> hear my voice. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> 
trouble, therefore, I will seek the narrow ways. And so I will escape my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> companions and my miserable 
captivity! 

When I had spoken these words, I ran down the narrow path and hid myself in a small cave towards the 
north, weeping bitterly <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> I had lost my mother. Here too I considered all my pain and all my wounds. Here I 
cried and wept, pouring out my tears so that all the pain and malice of my wounds were flooded with my tears. 

Suddenly, a pleasant fragrance touched my nostrils, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a gentle breeze sent to me from my mother. What 
sighs I uttered and what tears I shed when I felt that modicum of comfort! I cried and wept such tears of joy 
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the mountain was moved in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> cave I had hidden. 

And I said, ‘O mother, mother Zion! What will <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> of me? Where is your noble daughter now? For how 
long, for how <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> will I be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> your motherly tenderness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> delight and joy with which you 
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> me up?’ With these tears I was as glad as if I had actually seen my mother. 

But my enemies heard my cries and said, ‘Where is our companion whom we have had until now to do 
everything we desired? Look how she calls on the citizens of heaven! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us employ all our skills to guard her 
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> care and attention so that she <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> escape us! Remember we had her completely in our power! If 
we do this, then she will follow us again.’ 

But I slipped out quietly from the cave where I had been hiding. I aimed to climb so high that my enemies 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not find me. But they released such a sea of raging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> against me that there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> get over 
it. There was a bridge, but it was so small and narrow that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not cross it. And on the other shore of the sea 
the mountains were so tall and jagged that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not journey there either. And I said, ‘What can a poor 
creature do now? For a little while I was able to feel the benevolent presence of my mother, and I <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> she 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lead me back to her. But now she has deserted me! Where am I to turn? If I turn back now to my former 
captivity, my enemies will mock me more than ever before! I cried to my mother in tears and felt her sweet 
presence, but now she has abandoned me again!’ 

But I had been <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> strength by the sweet comforting influence of my mother which I had felt before. So 
now I turned to the east and <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out again on the narrow paths. The paths were so full of thorns and briars and 
other obstacles that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> hardly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> any headway. Eventually, with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> effort and stress, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> 
through, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> almost breathless with exhaustion from my labours. 

Tired and exhausted as I was, I at last reached the summit of the mountain in which I had previously hidden, 
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> towards a gully where I had to descend. But there I stopped and looked. Vipers, scorpions, 
lizards and various other species of reptile were hissing their tongues at me and blocking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> down! 

‘Mother, where are you?’ I screamed in my terror. ‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have borne this pain more easily if I’d <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> felt 
your presence before. Now I’ll be thrown into captivity again where I was kept for so long! Where is your help 
now?’ 

It was then that I heard my mother’s voice speaking to me, ‘Run, my daughter, run, for you have been granted 
wings to fly with by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Giver whom none can resist. Quickly, therefore, fly over all these creatures 
opposing you.’ And then, with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> feeling of comfort and release, I took up my wings and flew quickly over 
those venomous and death-dealing vipers. 


3 .The tabernacle 

And I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to a tabernacle, the inside of which was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the hardest steel. And entering in, I performed 
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> where before I had done deeds of darkness. 

In this tabernacle, therefore, towards the north, I <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up a pillar of unpolished iron on which I hung small 
fans of various feathers moving back and forth. I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> manna, and I ate it. 

Towards the east I built a fortification of square stones, kindling a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> within. Here I drank myrrh-flavoured 
wine with grape-must. 



Towards the south I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a tower of square stones on which I hung red shields; in the windows I placed 
trumpets of ivory. And in the middle of the tower I poured out honey and prepared a precious ointment of 
various spices, so that its strong fragrance permeated all of the tabernacle. 

Towards the west, however, I did no work, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> was turned towards the world. 

But while I was occupied with this labour, my enemies took up their quivers and attacked my tabernacle with 
their arrows. Because of the zeal with which I was doing my work, I did not notice the frenzy of their attacks 
until the door of the tabernacle was filled with arrows. Nevertheless none of their arrows was able to pierce the 

door or the steel covering of the tabernacle, and so I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be harmed by them. 10 

Seeing this, they sent a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> torrent of waters to throw me down with my tabernacle, but they achieved 
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> with their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> any fear now, I derided them for their failure and said, ‘The Craftsman 
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this tabernacle is stronger and wiser than you are. Gather up your arrows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> them 
away, for they <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you the victory you desire. Look and see: they have caused no injury!’ 

‘I have fought <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> wars against you in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hardship and pain. You tried to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> me to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> but were 
unable, for I was armed with the most powerful of weapons; I brandished sharp swords against you and 
defended myself vigorously. Depart, therefore, and leave me, for you can do <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> more against me!’ 

7. How anger, hatred and pride are overcome 

When anger is about to burn up my tabernacle, I look to the goodness of God, whom anger has <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> touched, 
and so I <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> softer than the air which waters the dry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with its sweetness. Then the virtues and powers 
manifest the force of their green vigour <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> me, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> joy is mine! In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I feel the goodness of 
God! 

But when hatred attempts to defame me, I look to the mercy and the pain of God’s Son, and so I contain my 
flesh, receiving the sweet fragrance of roses from the thorns which grew up in memory of the Faithful One. In 
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I acknowledge my Saviour! 

And when pride 11 strives to build <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a firm foundation rock and raise up his tower of vanity <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> me, 
and when he is about to reach a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> height that none can equal, and when I appear <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the others: oh, 
who will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to my aid? This is the ancient serpent wishing to be greater than all! It is he who has fallen into 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and is trying now to throw me down with him!

12. The Departure of Richardis of Stade 


With the various difficulties faced by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> community, some of the nuns decided to leave the Rupertsberg, 
sometimes for positions elsewhere. In 1151 Richardis of Stade was appointed abbess ofBassum, in the diocese 
of Bremen, where her brother was Archbishop. Hildegard,for various reasons, including her personal affection 
for Richardis, opposed the appointment. A delegation from Bremen appealed to Archbishop Heinrich of Mainz, 
the diocese in which the Rupertsberg belonged. When ordered by Heinrich to release Richardis, Hildegard sent 

the following response (Letter 18R). 1 Eventually forced to submit, she sent a grieving letter to Richardis 
herself, now installed at Bassum. 2

enemies, and eventual return of the errant soul. Its basic thematic structure is an allegory in which the various 
moral qualities in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being are conceived and externalized as active forces, the ‘virtutes’ or, as the

(Play of the Virtues) of 1158, 1 <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> its list of characters is shorter and there is less dramatic breadth, it is 
perhaps more suitable for reading than the later performance piece. Arguably, there is a stronger focus on the 
plight ofAnima, the personified soul, as she struggles to free herself from the wiles of the deceiver. 

The exact date of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> version of the play is not known, although Abbess Tengswich ofAndemach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

unusual liturgical practices, for after a respectful opening, Tengswich continues:

church chanting psalms with unbound hair and for decorative purposes wear <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> white silk veils which reach 
down to the ground. On their heads they wear crowns of woven gold in which crosses have been placed on each 
side and at the back, while a figure of the lamb is placed neatly at the front. And they adorn their fingers with 
golden rings. And they do this although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> shepherd of the Church forbade such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in his epistle,

while he who wished to soar above himself fell to the ground.

THE SOUL, DEJECTED, LAMENTS: 

What grievous distress, what a heavy weight 

I bear in the garment of this life, 

<span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> it is too hard for me to fight against the flesh. 

VIRTUES: 

O soul, formed by the will of God,

As Hildegard became established at Rupertsberg, she began to gain a reputation for prophecy and political 
wisdom as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as theological understanding, and it was in this role as adviser and prophetess that she became 
<span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as the ‘Sibyl of the Rhine’. Soon her direct advice was being sought, and given, in the current affairs of 
the German Empire and the Church. The letters here, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> difficult to date precisely, illustrate aspects of this 
activity. 

The letter to Pope Eugenius <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">III</span> is markedly <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in tone from her earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to the same correspondent

intriguing animal imagery. It is tempting to relate the image of the bear to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Germany, Frederick 
Barbarossa, who signed a political agreement with Eugenius at the Treaty of Constance in 1153. 

The letter to Henry (Bishop of Liege 1145-64) is similarly urgent, with its imagery of dark clouds ominously 
threatening the mountain of flowers and gentle breezes. The dark clouds are a less precise kind of metaphor 
than that of the bear, but the implication is that the Church is somehow threatened. Henry was loyal to 
Barbarossa and took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Italian expedition of 1154, attending the Emperor’s coronation by Pope

a letter from Hadrian, delivered by his legates to the Diet of Besanqon, provoked a bitter row with Barbarossa 
and his chancellor Rainald Dassel, who interpreted its requirements as a threat to imperial power. Hildegard’s 
letter to Hadrian presents a series of apocalyptic images and metaphors which, although bafflingly unclear, are 
of undoubted relevance to the events of Hadrian’s pontificate.

brother, the priest Eckbert, to turn her dictated German into written Latin; her visions were experienced while 
she was in a trance; they show less evidence of the wide reading that characterizes Hildegard’s work. In

that although each detail of the description represents a physical object in Hildegard’s universe, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> 
attaches a further significance to it in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of faith and the events of history. In so doing she implies that 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and the universe are closely and inextricably connected, as microcosm and macrocosm. This ties in 
with her exalted view of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being in Scivias 1 , 3, 17 (translated below), a characteristic attitude of the 
twelfth-century Renaissance. 


The cosmic egg 

After these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> I saw a huge form, rounded and shadowy, and shaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an egg ; 1 it was pointed at the top, 
wide in the middle and narrower at the bottom. Its outer layer consisted of an atmosphere of bright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with a 
kind of dark membrane beneath it. And in that outer atmosphere there was a ball of red <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> so large that all the 
huge <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> was lit up by it. Directly above the fireball was a vertical row of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lights which held it with their

At times the fireball rose upwards and was met by more fire, which caused it to shoot out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> flames. 
At times, however, the fireball moved downwards and encountered a region of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cold that caused it quickly 
to retract its flames. 

From the outer atmosphere of fire, a wind blew storms. And from the dark membrane beneath, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> wind 
raged with further storms which moved out in all directions on the globe. The dark membrane contained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a

massive impact of sounds and storms and sharp stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and small . 2 Whenever the noise arose it <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> in 
motion the layer of bright fire, winds and air, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> causing bolts of lightning to presage the sounds of thunder; 
for the fiery energy senses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> agitations of the thunder <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> it. 

Below the dark layer, however, was the purest of ether with no membrane beneath it. Here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> I saw a 
fireball, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> magnitude, filled with white-shining energy; it had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lights placed above it which held it and 
prevented it from passing beyond the circuit of its course. Situated everywhere throughout the ether were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> 
bright spheres, into which the white fireball discharged its energy at regular intervals. It then rose up again to 
the red fireball where it recharged its fires and sent them <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> again into the bright spheres. The ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> 
contained a wind, which poured out its storms and extended them all over the cosmos. 

Beneath the ether I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> a layer of watery air, which had a white membrane beneath it. It spread out 
everywhere, giving off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> to the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of the world. At times it accumulated quickly and sent out a sudden 
fall of rain with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> crash. But when it spread gently it sent <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> soft rain with only gentle agitation. But 
from it there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a wind and storms which spread all over the globe. 

And in the middle of these elements there was a sandy ball of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> size which was so surrounded by these 
elements that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not move in any direction. However, when the winds collided with the elements, the force 
of their impact <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in motion a little. 

And I saw between the north and the east the likeness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain, which showed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> areas of 

darkness towards the north and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> towards the east. 3 The darkness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not affect the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> nor the

And again I heard a voice speaking to me from heaven.

Winds 

The four cardinal winds support the firmament below and above the level of the sun. They hold <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> the 
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> cosmos from the lower to the upper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the firmament and cover it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a cloak. The east wind 
embraces the air and dispenses gentle moisture to the dry regions. The west wind mingles with the floating 
clouds, to sustain the waters and prevent them from bursting forth. The south wind keeps the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> under its 
control and prevents it from burning up everything. The north wind controls the outer areas of darkness, so that 

they do not exceed their measure. These four winds are the wings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God. 10 If they were all <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> in

But now they are securely locked by the keys of God’s majesty so that the elements are held in moderation in

The collateral winds 

Each of these main winds has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> weaker winds assisting it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> arms, into which at times it breathes its

And when they are agitated by a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> command, they receive their breath and strength from the main winds. 

In such instances they are agitated so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> that they produce a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal of noise and dangerous collisions, in

illness . 12 

From the beginning of the world, the main winds have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> been fully agitated to their full strength, nor will 
they be so moved until the last day. But then they will reveal their strength and send <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> the fullness of their

The south wind is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a kind of iron rod with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> branches at the top and a sharp point at the bottom.

contains the firmament and the abyss of this region so that it does not collapse. 

And at the top it has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> strengths <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> branches, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of which tempers the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> as it rises, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span>

Then also, from the same heat, the stars heat the air and strengthen it, and the warm air gives off it moisture as

wane so that the moon will again be full. 


The purification by the airs 

But when the stars appear at night, then burning spheres and projectiles are sometimes seen flying in the air. 
The explanation is that the stars are sending their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy into the air in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to strengthen it, and the

heat of the stars so that its impurities fall from it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> dregs. 


The threads of the air 


Similarly, when summer and winter separate so that either summer recedes and winter arrives or winter recedes 
and summer arrives, then a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> mixed substance appears, flying in the air, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a whiteness of threads, where 
the air is purifying itself. This descends to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> owing to the collision of summer and winter, that is, when 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> seasons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into conflict with each other. 


Eclipses 

Sometimes an eclipse of the moon is seen when the elements and the storms collide as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they had a 
conflict <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> them. On these occasions the moon is darkened by the storms for a period rather than waning or 
being extinguished. But the force of the moon is such that it can overcome these storms and send out its 
splendour again, because the force of the moon is greater than the force of these storms. 

The five planets 

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> five planets, which have their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and from the ether; they are the support and 
strength of the firmament. They have their orbits in the heights and depths of the firmament where the sun’s 
rays do not reach and where its splendour is hardly shown. Wherever they are situated and wherever they move 
to they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> serve the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> in its orbit, restraining the sun’s speed and causing its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to diminish in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> 
that because of the planets, the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> does not send out such burning heat as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> do if they did not restrain it.

The retarding of the firmament 

The firmament revolves at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> speed, and the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> - with the other planets - moves a little more slowly in the 
opposite direction and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> restrains its speed, because, if the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> did not restrain it and slow it down, or if the 
<span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> - with the other planets - moved in the opposite direction to the firmament at the same speed as it actually 
revolves, then all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be thrown into disorder and the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of the firmament <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> collapse.

<span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> and the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> in opposition to it, it is rapidly thickened and strengthened by the heat of the sun, for the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> 
moves through the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of the firmament and pervades and penetrates it with its fire. Before the fall of Adam, 
the firmament was motionless and did not turn, but after his fall it began to move and revolve. However, after 
the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> it will stay motionless just as it was at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> before Adam. Now, however, it revolves for a 
reason: so that it is confirmed and strengthened by the sun, moon, and stars, for if it stood still it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> quickly

elements, and this purification is what we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> as black clouds bearing water; just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> placed in a pot over a

The music of the firmament 

In its revolving the firmament emits marvellous sounds, which we nevertheless <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> hear because of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

22. Gemstones (from Physica IV) 


The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Gemstones is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> IV o/Physica, or The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Simple Medicine, a compendium of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> health and well-being. In this respect it follows a tradition that goes back to Greek and Roman writers 
such as Dioscorides and Pliny. In the extracts here we are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> information on the occurrence of particular

to treat specific complaints and ailments. Such illnesses are usually understood in terms of an imbalance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

Preface 

All gemstones contain energy and moisture. They terrify the devil, who hates and despises them because he 
remembered that their beauty appeared in him before he fell from the glory which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> him, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> 
because some precious stones are created from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy in which he himself has his punishments. It 
was in fact by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> that the devil was defeated, through God’s will, and he fell into fire, just as he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> defeated

Precious stones and jewels have their origin in the East, and in those areas where the heat of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> is 
particularly strong. The mountains that occur in such areas have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> fire, which comes from the 
heat of the sun; similarly the rivers that flow in these regions are always boiling hot, due to the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat 
of the sun. Accordingly, when at times the rivers flood and break their banks, increasing in volume and rising up 
to the mountains that are burning with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat of the sun, and when these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> into contact with the

on it. And so the foam hangs in those places <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> ‘glitten’ or glue, and <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> hardens into

of foam, which remain hanging at various locations in the mountains, are dried by the heat of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span>

And when the rivers rise again in flood, they carry <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the gemstones and deposit them in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> regions,

l. Smaragdus 

Smaragdus grows in the early morning at the rising of the sun, when the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> is powerfully placed in its circuit 
for the perfection of its journey, and when the grasses and greenness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> flourish at their best, for the

powerfully as a lamb sucking its milk so that the heat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is barely enough to ripen and nourish the 
greenness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the plants fertile enough for the producing of fruit.

the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> and because all its material springs from the greenness of the air. So for a pain in the heart, stomach, or 
side, carry smaragdus about you to warm the flesh of your body, and it will feel better. But if the illness strikes a 
person so suddenly that they can barely withstand its attack, then they should immediately <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> the smaragdus 
in their mouth, so that it is moistened with saliva, and so that the saliva is warmed by the gemstone, and they 
should breathe in and out repeatedly. Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> doubt the sudden onsets of that illness will cease. 

And if someone falls in a fit of epilepsy, then - <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> where they are lying - <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a piece of smaragdus in 
their mouth, and their <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> will revive. And after they have got up again and taken the stone from their mouth, 
they should look at it attentively and say:

They should repeat this again and again on the following <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> in the mornings, and they will be cured. But they

And again, drawing the stone transversely through the bread, say:

3. Onyx 

Onyx is warm and grows at the third hour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in thick cloud, when the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> burns powerfully but is 
covered by various rising clouds which prevent it from appearing through them because of their flood of waters. 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the stone does not hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat of fire, but it has the warmth of the air, for its origin is in the root of the

wine in a bronze, copper, or iron receptacle, add onyx to the wine and ‘beizze’ [steep] it for either fifteen or 
thirty days. Then remove the stone, leaving the wine in the receptacle, and touch the eyes each night with a little 
of the wine; they will clear and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> healthy. 

For pains in the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> or sides, warm an onyx in your hands or close to your body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> taking wine again and

so that the sweat coming from the stone mingles with the wine. Finally <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> the stone in the hot wine and drink 
it as it is, and the heat in your <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> or side will cease. 

For a complaint of the stomach, prepare wine with onyx as described and then prepare a ‘sufen’ [soup] from 
the wine with hen’s eggs and flour. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Make</span> and eat this frequently; it will purify your stomach and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> you

onyx mixture as described above and eat the marinaded meat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> those dishes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by marinading in vinegar. 
Do this frequently; the spleen will heal and the swelling stop.

humours in which the fevers originate. 

If you are oppressed by melancholy, focus your attention on the onyx and then <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> it immediately into your 
mouth; your mental depression will then cease. 

And if ‘schelme’ [cattle sickness] starts attacking and killing your cows, heat some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> in a vessel over a

and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the stone in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> days.

4. Beryl 

Beryl is a warm gemstone which develops, between the third hour and midday, from the foam of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> when the

Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> more from air and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> than from fire, but nevertheless it has some of 
the properties of fire. And if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has drunk or eaten poison, then he should ‘schabe’ [place] a little of the beryl

while fasting, and the poison will foam up through vomiting, or it will <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> out of him through the rear. 

Whoever keeps a piece of beryl constantly about them, and frequently takes it in their <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and frequently

remain calm. 


5. Sardonyx 

Sardonyx is warm, and grows each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> when the sixth hour has passed and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> line of the ninth hour

the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> begins to cool down; it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> contains more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> than air or water. It has strong powers in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>

the sun, when no impurity appears in the brightness of the sun. When someone places the stone on their bare 
skin and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> puts it often in their mouth so that their breath touches it, then takes it out and puts it back in

and flee them. And if by their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or woman is burning in carnal desire, then he should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the 
sardonyx on his ‘lanchen’ [loins] and the woman should <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> it on her umbilicum, and they will have a remedy 
for their libido. But if someone has suffered an acute ‘sucht’ [attack of fever], as soon as they have sweated out 
the fever and are feeling better, then <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> the stone in a ring on their finger and they will not suffer any relapse of 
the ‘sucht’. 


6. Sapphire [excerpt] 

Sapphire is warm; it grows around the midday period, when the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> burns so vigorously in its heat that the air 
becomes to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> extent hazy, and then the sun’s splendour from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> quantity of heat which it has at 
that period passes through the air less readily and its splendour at that period appears not as fully as it does 
when the air has cooled a little. Sapphire is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> opaque and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> more akin to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> than to air or water; and 
it signifies the full <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of wisdom. 

A person who has ‘vel’ in their eye should hold a sapphire in their <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and warm it there [or in a fire] and 
touch the ‘vel’ in his eye with the moist stone; continue to do this for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> morning and night, and 
the ‘vel’ will diminish, and disappear. And if your eyes are red with pain and ‘seregent’ [hurt], or if your eyes are 
weak, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the sapphire in your mouth while fasting and moisten it with saliva of the mouth and then <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> 
the same saliva that has moistened the stone on your finger and apply it round your eyes so that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> makes 
contact with the inside of your eyes; your eyes will heal and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> clear. 

And for a person who is completely ‘virgichtiget’ [suffering from gout] so that they <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> bear the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> 
pressure in their head and in the rest of their body, have them <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> the stone in their mouth, and the ‘gicht’ will 
cease. 



23. Songs from Symphonia 


The Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations was a collection of songs initially compiled in the 
middle period of Hildegard’s career between the completion of Scivias in 1151 and the beginning of <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on The 
<span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits in 1158. Other songs were composed later and added to the collection, the fullest 
manuscript being that of the Riesenkodex of the 1180s. This translation of selected songs is based on the edition 
by Pudentiana Barth, M. Immaculata Ritscher and Joseph Schmidt-Gorg , Hildegard von Bingen. Lieder 
(Salzburg 1969), which follows the oldest manuscript, a compilation of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> by Hildegard and Elisabeth that 
was sent to the monastery ofVillers during Hildegard’s lifetime and is now preserved as Codex 9 of the library 
of the monastery of Dendermonde, in Belgium. For ease of comparison, the notes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the numbering of the 
songs in the edition by Barbara Newman, Symphonia ( Ithaca , 1998 ).

In her commentaries, apparently designed as homilies on the readings of the Gospel at particular church 
services and festivals during the Christian year, Hildegard allowed full rein to her allegorical interests, often 
with bold and innovative interpretations. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> homilies for Christmas reveal a strong Platonic vein in her 
thinking. In the first, the literal events of Luke’s Nativity narrative <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> on added significance when seen in the

new, psychological reading that complements the first. Both homilies illustrate the tendency in medieval 
reading to allow for <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> layers and levels of interpretation. The <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> but several

that derives from Proverbs 1:7, ‘The fear of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge... ’ This is the sapiential side 
of Hildegard’s teachings, which she was to develop in the rest of her writing career. The second figure is that of 
poverty of spirit’, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> face <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be seen because of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> pouring down on her head from the figure of

‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven’ (Matthew 5:3). This points to the ethically 
and socially engaged side of Hildegard’s theology; again it is something that <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> leaves her, and it is still 
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of her writing career some thirty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later.

symbolize, morally, the weak and the strong. In the explanations that follow, justice and the practice of justice

[Scivias I, i] 


I saw the likeness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain the colour of iron, and on it sat a figure in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> brightness, so bright that 
it dazzled my eyes. Light-filled shadows stretched out on either side: they were wings of astounding breadth and 
height. And before this figure, at the roots of the mountain, there stood an image covered with eyes, and because 
of the eyes I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> beneath.

The ‘great iron mountain’ which you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> represents God’s eternal kingdom. In its strength and stability it can 
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> down by change or mutability. The ‘man seated in the bright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> that dazzles your eyes’ is the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who rules all the circle of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the brightness of his unceasing glory. In his eternal divinity he can 
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be grasped by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> understanding. The ‘light-filled wings’ are the soft and gentle protection, the blessed 
defence of warning and reproof, the just and pious demonstration of ineffable justice <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

2. The fear of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> 

‘And before this figure, at the roots of the mountain, there stood an image covered with eyes, and because of the 
eyes I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> beneath.’ 

The ‘image covered with eyes’ represents fear of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the presence of God. She contemplates the 
kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in all humility. Covered with the discernment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and fair intentions, she practises 
enthusiasm and constancy in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> behaviour. And this is why you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> beneath the 
cover of the discerning eyes: because her sharp-sighted gaze dispels all the obliviousness to God’s justice which 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings often feel in their jaded hearts. And her vigilance is such that it <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be diverted by the 
weakness of mortal inquiry. 


3. The poor in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> 

The fear of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is followed by the poor in spirit: ‘And in front of her was the figure of a child dressed in a 
pale tunic and white shoes.’ 



In the devotion of humility, poverty of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is held in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in her blessed state by fear of the Lord. And she 
does not care for the elation or leap of the heart; instead she loves simplicity and sobriety of mind. In the pale 
colour of her tunic, she attributes her just deeds to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and not to herself - hence the pale colour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of her 
worshipful subjection - and she follows faithfully in the bright footsteps of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of God. 

‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> her face because of the bright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> pouring down on her head from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated on the 
mountain.’ 

He who worthily rules the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> floods the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and strength of that blessed state with such 
radiance of presence that you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> grasp it with the weak eyes of mortal perception. For he who holds the 
riches of <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> subjected himself in humility to the state of poverty. 

4. How the virtues proceeding from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> protect the God-fearing and the poor in <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> 

‘But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> living sparks sprang <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on the mountain and hovered round these figures most 
pleasingly.’ 

Diverse and powerful virtues emerge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> sparks of lightning from the all-powerful God. With their help and 
protection, they surround those who truly fear the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and those who truly <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> poverty of spirit. The virtues 
embrace them ardently and win them over. 

5. How people’s motivations <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be hidden from God’s awareness 

‘In the mountain itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> small windows were visible, at which there appeared the faces of men, some pale, 
some pure.’ 

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is this: people’s motivations <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be concealed from the depth and profundity of God’s acute 
awareness. All too often they themselves either reveal their lack of warmth or manifest their purity. In their 
hearts and actions, some tire themselves out and fall asleep in disgrace, while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> spur themselves on and 
remain vigilant in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> honour. 


6. Solomon on the same topic 

Solomon testifies in a similar way, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to my will, saying: ‘He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack 
hand: but the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of the diligent maketh rich.’ 1 

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do not practise justice and if they refuse to stamp out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> or cancel their debts, they 
will <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> weak and poor. In their idleness they will remain apart from the marvellous workings of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> 
favour. But as for those who practise powerful <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of salvation and run on the path of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> - they will reach 
the springing fountain of glory, from which they will gain the precious riches of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and heaven!

The main focus of the six visions of The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits (1158-63) is the ‘Man.’ The full symbolic and 
allegorical significance of this figure is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> clear as the author moves on to the explanation and exegesis of

that from above his shoulders he was <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the clouds in the bright ether, and from below his shoulders 
down to his thighs he was beneath the clouds in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> white cloud; from his thighs to his knees he was in the 
earthly air, from his knees to the calves of his legs in the earth, and from his calves to the soles of his feet in the 
waters of the abyss (but in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> stood above the abyss). He had turned towards the East, so 

that he looked 2 both East and South. 

Now his face shone with such splendour that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not perfectly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it.

And each 
cloud was supported by its wind. 

While the wind bearing the cloud of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> remained before the man’s face, the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> winds descended with 
their clouds to his chest, and there they expanded their breath outwards. But the wind that had stayed before the

In the cloud of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> were myriads of fiery beings; and they were all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> life, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> will and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> conjunction.

<span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> in each stage of its rising and setting. Then the wind gave <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> a blast and said: ‘The woman will bear fruit, 
and the goat will wage war against the North.’ 

And there was in the aforementioned darkness a countless number of lost souls, who had turned <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from

Next I saw a cloud coming from the North , 10 reaching towards the darkness. It was arid and joyless, for the 
<span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> had <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> touched it nor shown itself to it.

And I heard the ancient serpent 11 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> to himself: ‘I will prepare all my forces of strength and wage war 
against my enemies with all I can muster!’

manner. 


27. The Seven Vices and Virtues (from The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I) 


In the following psychomachia, or ‘battle of the soul’, the various vices and virtues are personified and 
endowed with characteristics based on aspects of the human, animal, plant, demonic or angelic spheres of life. 
They speak and act, and have <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> personalities, and in the subsequent exegesis they are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> names, 
usually based on abstract nouns or concepts, such as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> vice, ‘Love of the World’, and his/her opponent, 
the virtue ‘Heavenly Love’ Unlike the mainstream tradition of the Psychomachia of Prudentius, in which all the 
personifications are female, in Hildegard the gender of these figures is hinted at but not formally stated. In the 
<span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> image, it seems best, from the context of the description given, to picture the figure as a man, 
perhaps a medieval ‘wild man’ with some of the characteristics of the inhabitants of the margins of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> 
(Ethiopia was on the edge of medieval maps), as described for instance in such medieval texts as The Wonders 

of the East 1 or Mandeville’s Travels.

a tree below the branches with his arms and his legs. The tree flourished with all kinds of blossom, and he 
gathered the flowers to him with his hands and said:

beautiful vision of the eyes?

When he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> this, the aforesaid tree dried up to the roots and plunged into the darkness, and the figure 
fell with it. 

2. And from the aforesaid storm-cloud I heard a voice respond to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> figured 

‘This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> foolishness, for you desire to have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a spark in the ashes; and you do not seek that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> 
which <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> fades with the beauty of youth, and <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> weakens in <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> age. You lack all light, you are in

state you call your flowers! 

‘I am a column of celestial harmony; I direct all the joys of life. I do not scorn life, but I trample all hateful 
things, and I disparage you. For I am the mirror of all virtues, in which the faithful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> themselves clearly. 
But you run the paths of the night! Your hands are busy with failure!’ 

The second figure had the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of a hunting-dog, trained to course for his prey.4 He stood on his hind legs, 
reaching up with his front paws round an upright staff, and his tail wagged playfully as he said: 

3. ‘What is happiness for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and what moves him moderately to laughter? Is there not a beautiful breath in

4. And again from the storm-cloud I heard a voiced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a response to the image: 

‘You criminal! You are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the wind blowing about in the squalid manners of playful men, but in your

You proffer your 
useless and criminal words, and you strike a wound in the hearts of men. You frame your deeds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the

‘But I am the belt of sanctity and the cloak of honesty. I am an honoured guest at the nuptials of the king. 
There I attend in joy and discipline, and there I appear in all the trappings of righteousness.’ 

The third figure resembled a man, except that he had a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> crooked nose, his hands were the paws of a bear, 
and his feet were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the claws of a gryphon. He had black hair, and was dressed in pale clothing. ^ 

5. He said: ‘It is better to be playful than sad. Play is not wickedness! Do not all who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> rejoice and sing? 
The heavens and all <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> are full of joy; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I too will rejoice!

flowers, the air where I feast on all the sights of my eyes! Why should I not rejoice in all these things? Humans 
with animals and animals with humans; all of them play and amuse themselves together. This is as it should 
be!’ 

6. And again I heard the response of the voice from the storm-cloudh 

‘You are idolatry, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> you act in all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to your self-will, and you will be a dead sound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by

animal. But all your behaviour is based not on living but on dead creatures, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> you reach out for what you 
desire, and you walk in the paths of whim and vanity. 

‘But I blush at all this, I hide under the wings of the cherubim; I learn the mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the books and

everywhere by the practice of honesty I discern the will of God, from which you flee in your unseeing 
ignorance!’ 

The fourth figure was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a dense cloud of smoke in the shape of a man, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it did not have any limbs of

side, but remained in the aforesaid darkness, motionless. ^ 

7. And it spoke: 

‘I have designed <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> and created nothing. So why should I labour for any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> cause? Why tear myself to

8. And again I heard the response of the voice from the aforementioned storm-cloud: 10 

‘You creature of stone! What are you saying? The plants and flowers proffer scents to other plants; the stone 

presents its moisture 11 to other stones; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> creature extends embraces to its fellows. All creatures serve the

Hildegard was at pains to emphasize that in her visions and prophecies she not only saw unknown images and 
mysteries but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> heard their interpretation as a voice from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> speaking to her. What is not always clear 
in The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits and other <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> is where the modern editor or translator is to punctuate the text. 
Where does the ‘voice from heaven’ actually finish speaking? The answer to this is uncertain, and perhaps 
deliberately so. The voice from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> merges with the voice of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> visionary and exegete. But 
Hildegard is serious about her visionary experiences, and she relates them to the experience told in Paul’s Letter 
to the Corinthians of how a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was taken up to the third <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> where he heard ‘hidden words, which it is

all the four, and the face of an ox on the left side of all the four, and the face of an eagle over all the four.’ 2 

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of this passage is as follows. The <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the activity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is man, and this <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is from God.3 
The ‘face of the man’ signifies the goodness of God, through which humanity has the perception of the 
senses. 

The ‘face of the lion’ represents the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God, in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> gave reason to humanity.

The ‘face of the ox’ indicates the sacrifice which is God, and it demonstrates to humanity how to sacrifice to 
God. And this is on the left because in the act of sacrifice something is lacking: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> is

30. Allegorical Letters 


The six letters selected here illustrate varying aspects of Hildegard’s allegorical method. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and possibly 
the earliest of the six, an admonitory letter to the imperial supporter Hermann of Constance, uses the imagery 
of pruning garden plants to remind the bishop of his duties, while the second letter, to a provost at Averbode, 
develops a more traditional image of the pastor as shepherd of his sheep. In both cases Hildegard’s message 
comes from the ‘living light’ or ‘secret light’ of her visionary experience. The third letter, to an abbess, is a 
response to a more personal query, but nevertheless turns the ‘lion’ of a biblical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> into a challenging 
allegorical figure. In her message to the papal supporter Eberh ard of Salzburg Hildegard sends her advice, 
encouraging the bishop (like Gregory the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> before her) to divide his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> equally between <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> 
reflection and pastoral action. As in the letters to Abbot Adam and PiiorDimo that follow, Hildegard develops 
personified allegoi'ical figures, the maidens Love, Humility and Obedience; these are virtues and powers who 
stand at the threshold of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> mind, waiting for an invitation to lend their strength and assistance.

You who are an abbess and teacher 2 in the brightness of the leaping fountain, the representative of Christ,

And this humility was the humanity of our saviour, 

for <span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> created man, but Humility redeemed him. 20 

In all truth, the eye of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> is hope, but its <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is heavenly love, 21 and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are joined <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> by

The eye of humility, on the other hand, is faith; its <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is obedience and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are connected by 
renunciation of the world. 

<span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> was in eternity; and at the beginning of all holiness she <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> all created <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any

32. Queries and Requests: Selected Letters to Hildegard 


In the twelfth century, writing a letter was rather <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> composing a speech. The main intended effect was aural, 
and the purpose was to convey the spoken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> medium, so that the recipients of the letter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> 
hear ‘the voice of the absent person’ who had composed it. When it was received, the letter was read out loud, 
so that all present, whether literate or not, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> participate in its message. 

The communal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the letter meant that its style was oral and rhetorical, with a conventional 
structure of salutation, exordium, narration, petition and conclusion. Hildegar’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> letter, for instance, the 
appeal to Bernard of Clairvaux (which has already been considered for its content in the Introduction) , <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> 
be analysed structurally along these lines, and more examples of conventionally structured letters are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> 
below. At least in theory, the opening of the letter, the salutation, had to obey a rule whereby the names of 
sender and recipient were placed in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of seniority. The exordium that followed then <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the tone for the 
letter, with a suitable biblical quotation or moral to capture the attention of the recipient(s). 

If the sender was an important writer, then the letter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be valued very highly both in itself, as a token of 
the friendship of the sender, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> for its message and content. This phenomenon is partly to be explained by 
the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and expensive process involved in sending a letter. The message was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> dictated to a scribe, who 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> notes on his wax tablet, translate the letter if necessary, and then transcribe it onto parchment. It

the receipt of letters, and a corresponding value was attached to them when they finally arrived. Sometimes 
private messages were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> conveyed by the bearer of the letter to ensure that they did not reach the wrong ears. 
Often when a letter was composed for posterity, a copy was retained before the original was sent, and an 
important author <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have his or her letters gathered, edited and in some cases rewritten for the final 
collection. 

As <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as Hildegard’s correspondents are concerned, most are important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of her day, perhaps not 
surprising when we recall that she was a member of an established noble family from Bermersheim. She was 
frequently approached with specific requests, for instance for texts of sermons she had preached, or for advice 
on particular matters. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> the subject-matter of letters to Hildegard is usually spiritual, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> concerns

Abbot Adam to Hildegard, before 1166 [Letter 85 ] 3 * 

To the lady, his beloved mother, Hildegard, mistress of the sisters at Rupertsberg in Bingen, from brother Adam, 
although unworthy, of Ebrach. I write what little I can. 

When I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> received the fame of your name, I rejoiced with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> joy.3 2 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> increased my joy when, with a 
command both benevolent and marvellous, he directed you to show your face and allow your voice to be heard 

in our land.33 And he allowed me something I had scarcely been able to hope for, namely a meeting and

inconstant. 

It was in these times that I was born, and with sighs my parents dedicated me to God. And in my third year I

spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> about them in a simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> so that those who heard them were amazed at where they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

Then I in turn was amazed at myself, because when I saw these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in the depths of my soul, I still had the 
outward use of my eyes; and I was amazed that I did not hear of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> happening to anybody else. So I 
concealed the vision that I had in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> as I could. Of the outside <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> I knew very little, because I 
had been so frequently ill from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of my mother’s milk until now.

and my strength had failed. 

Exhausted by all this, I asked a nurse of mine whether she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> anything else apart from external 
objects. 

‘Nothing,’ she replied, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> any of these other things. 

Immediately I was gripped with a terrible fear, and I did not dare reveal the experience of these visions to 
anyone else. 

Nevertheless, I took to predicting future events, sometimes speaking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and sometimes having 
them taken down in writing. And when I was completely steeped in the vision I spoke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that were 
very strange to those who were listening. But when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the vision had lessened, then I behaved more 
in the character of a child than of someone of my years; I was terribly ashamed, and often wept, and on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>

Because of the fear that I felt towards other people, I did not dare tell anyone actually how I saw my visions; 
but a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> woman of high rank to whom I had been sent for my upbringing became aware of this and revealed

Then, in the same experience of a vision, I was compelled by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pressure of pains to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> what I

But then my veins and marrow became filled with powers I had lacked in my childhood and youth. 

I intimated these experiences to the monk who was my teacher. A reliable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of high standing in the

<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of these marvels.

to the abbot, and from then on he eagerly worked with me at writing them down. 

In that same vision I understood the writings of the prophets, evangelists and other saints, and <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>

of many, and he himself read them out. And trusting fully in the grace of God, he sent me to <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> into writing, 
more attentively than I had before, all those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that I had seen and heard. 


34* Gebeno of Eberbach: The Pentachronon 


During Hildegard’s lifetime the monastery of Eberbach in the Rhinegau had enjoyed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> relations with 
Rupertsberg. In 1220, perhaps influenced by the current interest in Foachim of Fiore, Prior Gebeno of Eberbach 
<span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> about compiling his Pentachronon (The Five Ages), a prophetic <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> based on excerpts from Hildegard’s

leaving only a six-year-old brother to succeed to the throne. As a reply, Hildegard wrote in her prophetic 
manner, but nevertheless sent some general personal and political advice. For his excerpt, however, Gebeno 

chose only the second half of Hildegard’s letter, 1 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> omitting all the personal context of the original exchange

35* From the Canonization Protocol 


In the thirteenth century, just as the need arose for Hildegard’s sanctity to be confirmed, the process of official 
papal recognition of a saint became more rigorous and discriminating. In this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> development, the procedure 
for canonization was entrusted to a special commission, which arranged interviews with those who had 
<span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> the saint during his or her lifetime or with those who had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of miracles reported to have taken 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> due to the saint’s influence. The canonization protocol for Hildegard herself was compiled 
during the pontificate of Pope Gregory IX (1227-41). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> protocol was completed in 1233 but rejected for 
the lack of corroborating influence, especially the lack of reliable names of interviewees or of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> reported to 
have been cured by Hildegard’s influence. A second protocol was commissioned in 1237 and finished by 1243, 
but there is no evidence that it actually reached Rome; perhaps the prelates of Mainz, the diocese under which 
Hildegard’s monastery fell, decided to abandon the case. In the end, therefore, the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> for Hildegard’s sanctity 
was decided unofficially by the popular devotion of local Rhineland churches, and today Hildegard features as 
the focus of devotion in a number of well-known locations, notably of course in Eibingen and Disibodenberg. 

In the following extracts from the canonization protocol, the accompanying letter is addressed to Pope 
Gregory IX by the delegates of the commission, Gerbod, Walter and Arnold of Mainz. The delegates in turn cite 
Gregory’s letter in full before continuing with the actual findings of the commission.

demons in the same manner in the actual presence of the blessed Hildegard. 2 Afterwards they both served all 
their lives in the same monastery.

4.2. The priest Rorich <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the same under oath, but he added that when he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to exorcize the possessed

the windows inside the church. When he asked the demoniac Mechthild who the ravens were, she replied <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> 
that they were the demon’s companions waiting for him to be driven out. Having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> this, she opened her 
mouth and breathed out a cloud of black smoke. In this way, the possessed woman was freed, and at once the 

ravens disappeared. The more reasonable part4 of the convent testify to the same under oath. 


4-3- He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> adds that he saw eighteen demoniacs freed by the invocation of the same virigin’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> before her 
tomb (their names and places of origin are not known). The priest Daniel <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the same under oath, as does the 
provost. When, in the course of questions, the abbess was asked about the timing, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

9.1. The same [healing of demoniacs and epileptics] is told under oath by Hedwig of Alzey, and she adds that the 
blessed Hildegard was constantly in bed because of God’s scourge, until she was enlightened by the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, 

and then, walking through the convent, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> feel moved to sing the sequence O virga ac diadema .5 The

9.2. [Hedwig of Alzey] again <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that she saw a burning candle on the blessed Hildegard’s grave when a mass 
for the dead was being sung. After it was extinguished and the reading of the Gospel was begun, the candle was 
<span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> to have lighted itself again, not once, but several times. 

9.3. She <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> saw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (whose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is unknown) insane, bound, and possessed by a demon, and several

But in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> he freed himself from their hands and 
plunged into the river Nahe, which is at the foot of the mountain. And when most of the bystanders <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that 
he was dead, by the invocation of the grace of this virgin he was pulled out of the river alive. He confessed that 
he had been freed of the demon and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that he had been protected from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> by the sleeve of the 
blessed virgin Hildegard. Public opinion in Bingen agrees that this happened, as does the greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the

11.4. [The abbess] learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> noble lady of Trier (whose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is unknown) had gone mad 
through the magic of a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> young man, with the result that she was completely out of her mind. Her parents 
were grieving, and took refuge with the blessed Hildegard, seeking her grace. Hildegard took bread from her 
table, blessed it and gave it to the sick girl, who immediately tasted it and was cured. This miracle was seen by 
Odilia the cellarer and Hedwig the lay sister (as they swore under oath), who were both sitting at the table with 
the blessed Hildegard. 

12.1. Likewise, when a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> man, who had been unjustly excommunicated, was buried at her monastery, and 
when, because of this, the Church of Mainz suspended the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> services and ordered that he be removed, she 
(the blessed Hildegard) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the sign of the cross over his grave with her staff so that his tomb <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> no longer

12.3. Likewise, when the Bishop of Mainz, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Christian, was received in Bingen with the ringing of all the 
bells, Hildegard understood the bells sounding in the following way. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> bell rang out the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> ‘Shepherd,

Bishop. The third bell rang out in the voice of the Bishop: ‘I will depart and leave this <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> in confusion.’ She

This is confirmed under oath by 
Prioress Agnes, custodian Odilia, Sophia and several others. 

14.1. Bruno, custodian and priest at St Peter’s in Strasbourg, speaks under oath of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the blessed

little <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of her Life, which, when the blessed virgin died, was written immediately after her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> 
monks Gottfried and Theoderich. 


14.2. He believes that this contains the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> in all aspects, namely, that she originated from noble parents, that 


when she was five she saw a cow and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to her nurse: ‘Look how beautiful the calf is inside the cow, all white 
with dark patches on his forehead, feet and back!’ The astonished nurse immediately told Hildegard’s mother of 
this. Her mother commanded the woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> cow it was to show her the calf as soon as the cow gave birth. 
When this was all done as the blessed Hildegard had predicted, her mother realized that it was true. Her parents 
were amazed, and seeing that she had a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> character from other people, they decided to enclose her in a 
monastery. When she was eight, they dedicated her as an oblate to serve the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in Disibodenberg under the 
rule of the blessed Benedict, entrusting her to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> recluse named Jutta, the sister of the Count of 
Spanheim. 

14.3. Concerning her monastic vocation, he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that her reputation for sanctity spread widely and very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> 
girls of noble family streamed to her. But when the anchorage building <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not contain them all, she was 
admonished by the Lord, and <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> compelled, to move to the Rupertsberg. How she conveyed the news to the 
Abbot through her confessor and how he received it badly; how she miraculously obtained permission, moved to 
the location shown to her by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and built a monastery there in that unfamiliar place; how she began to serve 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> there with eighteen girls of noble family: all this is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in detail in the little <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of 
Hildegard. In this monastery, she established fifty benefices for noble ladies, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> for priests, and seven for poor 
women in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as this, she founded <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> monastery half a mile <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> 
across the Rhine, where she established thirty benefices. 

14.4. On her reputation, he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> popes heard of her fame and wrote to her, namely: Eugenius, Hadrian 
and Anastasius. The Archbishops of Mainz, Cologne, Trier and Magdeburg corresponded with her, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the

other prelates of churches; to all of these she sent replies. This information is taken from Hildegard’s <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of 
Letters. 

14.5. In addition, she began, in the forty-second year of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (although she had no earthly teacher), to write 
not a few books by the revelation of the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, which are more fully described in the introduction to her 
<span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> Scivias. She wrote the <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> Scivias, which took eleven <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to complete. She wrote the <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Simple 
Medicine, the <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Composite Medicine, the <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of the Exposition of the Gospels, the Songs of Heavenly 
Harmony and the Unknown Language, with its alphabet, all of which she completed in eight years, as is told 
more fully in the preface to the <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits. Finally, she wrote the <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">Works</span> in seven

He gave to each of them twelve books,? to be examined in the period from the octave of St Martin to the octave 
of Epiphany. After they had examined them, they returned them to the bishop. The latter then entrusted the

Baird and Radd K. Ehrman, The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, 2 vols (Oxford, 1994 and 1998). This in turn 
follows the original manuscript arrangement of the collected correspondence in which the letters are ordered 
hierarchically <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the rank and importance of the correspondent. Bernard’s letter is clearly significant, 
for it is placed first, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> before the various letters to the popes.

3. the simple meaning... textual analysis: Hildegard claimed a reading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Latin, as acquired perhaps 
gradually and subconsciously by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of participation in the liturgy and by meditated reading of the 
scriptures and the Fathers of the Church. Other than learning to read the Latin psalms, she had not had access 
to any formal study of Latin grammar or rhetoric. For a discussion of the ways in which Hildegard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have

4. through your word: Hildegard hopes to receive an answer to her letter which she will ‘hear’ when Bernard’s 
letter is read aloud. 

5. wooden beam... world: The wooden beam of the wine-press (itself a common image in Hildegard) is linked by 
a chain of association with ideas of the tree of the Garden of Eden in Genesis and the root of the race of Adam. 
The associative method is typical of early medieval approaches to the exegesis and interpretation of scripture 
but is particularly common in Hildegard. It leads to her characteristic ‘mixed metaphors’, which occur 
particularly frequently in her songs. 

6. the eagle staring at the sun: The eagle is an image from the tradition of the bestiary, the class of <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> popular 
in the medieval period in which natural history is mixed with allegorical explanation. In Hildegard’s thought, 
the eagle represents <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have the strength and maturity to understand the ways of God, who in turn is 
symbolized by the brightness of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> and referred to traditionally as the ‘Sun of Justice’. In a short letter of 
c.H50(?) to an Abbot at Busenberg [Letter 71], Hildegard uses similar imagery: ‘The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> speaks to

2. The Action of the Will (from Scivias) 


1. you are not a bundle... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the scriptures: Hildegard appears to mean: ‘As a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being you are 
more complex than you imagine, and you will learn this when sacred writings are explained to you.’ The phrase 
‘you are not a bundle of veins’ translates the Latin ‘quae non es sarcina medullarum’. The expression is an 
example of where Hildegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> and images remain obscure and allusive. In the previous section (I, 4, 17) 
she has been speaking about <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> age and how the ‘bones and veins incline to weakness’, which perhaps gives a 
hint of her meaning. 

2. oven : The transforming effect of intense heat is a basic assumption behind this image of the will as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in 
an oven. 


3. Redemption (from Scivias) 


1. <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> ablaze with the strength of strong lions... exhalations: This is probably an allusion to the strength of 
the learning and teaching of the trained scholars, from whom Hildegard felt distanced because she was, in her 
own words, merely a frail, uneducated woman. 

2. a secret seal on the vision: As the correspondence of the period shows, a seal was a standard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of ensuring 
secrecy for a letter. But the theme is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> biblical. In Revelation 5:1, John the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> says: ‘And I saw in the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> 
<span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of him that sat on the throne a <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> written <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.’ 

3 .And I saw a light-filled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerge: The Latin reads ‘Vidique de eodemfulgore praefatae aurorae 
serenissimum hominem egredientem’, suggesting that the figure is literally ‘the clearest man’, i.e. an image of 
Christ. A look at the illustration, reproduced in the Latin edition and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> books on Hildegard, is useful for 
understanding the iconography Hildegard herself gives on the exegesis of the image at II, 1, 13 (see below). 

4. as a woman... uneducated: The Latin has ‘in nomine femineo indocta’, ‘untaught in your feminine name’. The 
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of this paragraph spoken by the voice from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> provides a justification for Hildegard to continue in 
her <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as a female visionary and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> mouthpiece. Only with such a status can she feel justified in 
proceeding further in the predominantly male <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of literature and philosophy. Cf. her letter to Bernard of 
Clairvaux from about the same period (1). 

5 .fickleness: The Latin has ‘petulantia’; cf. The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits (27) for a detailed treatment of this failing. 

6 . The ‘shining fire’ which you see: Hildegard conventionally presents the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of the subsequent exegesis and 
explication of the vision as a transcription of the message spoken by the voice from the living fire. At intervals, 
we are reminded of the origin of this voice addressing Hildegard with the second person singular ‘you’ or 
speaking of ‘my’ inspiration; nevertheless, at least for the modern reader, it is tempting to forget this is the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> voice and to regard it as the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Hildegard herself. 

7. ‘Who knoweth not... all mankind’: Job 12:9-10. 

8. all the causes and relationships which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> up its fruitfulness and fertility: A paraphrase of the Latin ‘quod 
uicissitudinem plenitudinis suae in illis causis ignoret in quibus fructuosa consistit’, literally, ‘that he should be 
ignorant of the alternation of the fullness in the causes in which fruitfulness consists’. 

9. sighs, groanings and desires for God: Psalm 38:9: ‘Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not 
hid from thee.’ 

10. Therefore, also, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being contains the likeness of <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> her: Hildegard’s 
anthropology is broadly humanistic in its scope. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> the similar statement in The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits VI, lines 
263 and 267: ‘God has perfected all his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being... The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> bears all thins in 
her body...’ 

11. through the pure green vigour: Latin ‘per viriditatem suauitatis’. 

12. the localized word: Latin ‘per locale verbum’: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> speech, which is fleeting and impermanent compared 
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Word</span> of creation. 

13. commands of a ruler... his commands: Hildegard compares the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> spoken by a person in authority with 
the strength of God’s Word. 

14. the functioning word... the perfectly filled Word: The impermanent, pragmatic, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> ‘word’ is the capacity 
for speech, the crowning glory of homo loquens which sets <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings apart from the animal world. Opposed 
to it is the eternal, permanent, fully fixed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> ‘Word’, the expression of the holiness and perfection of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> 
the Father. 

15. And suddenly a dark sphere... <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> absent: In this <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> the dark material out of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>

16. ‘And it heated the clump of earth, turning it to flesh and blood’: For Hildegard, heat is the important force 
that transforms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> substance into another.

in her own <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> and concepts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to her, the Latin term materia represents the basic ‘matter’ of the

with the dualistic notions of the Cathars, against whom Hildegard was to preach in Cologne.

1. robbers lie in wait by night: Cf. the extract ‘The unarmed youth on the road’ in 16 ( Scivias II, 3,16-17).

a reference to the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman suggest in the notes to 
their translation The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen. 

6. golden shoes: The idea is perhaps biblical; cf. Ephesians 6:15, where shoes are associated with the ‘gospel of 
peace’. 

7. choose... the better part: Luke 10:42. 

8. Henry, Bishop of Liege: For Henry’s question to Hildegard, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> 32, Letter 37.

traditional imagery of the Church as mother and bride of the King.

3. ‘Who are these... to their windows?’: Isaiah 60:8. Here Hildegard comments on the relationship of the 
Synagogue to the Church. The final version of The Play of the Virtues, which was issued in 1158, should be 
compared with this passage. The opening section of the prologue gives <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> view of the same verse, for now 
Hildegard imagines it spoken by the prophets and patriarchs of <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> rather than the Synagogue:

of the Cathar movement, which rejected them.

7. travel on the road: The story recalls biblical parables, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> reflects the dangers of travel in the twelfth

4. Through his creation... eternal things: This is Hildegard’s explanation for her allegorical approach, namely 
that the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> can be understood not only as phenomena of nature, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> as symbols illustrating

level of the moon. 

5. The fall of Lucifer: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of the ideas in this passage go back to the biblical verses on the same topic in Isaiah 
14:12-15. A similar <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> of ideas about Lucifer occurs in The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits VI, 14, treated there for their 
moral significance rather than as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a cosmology, as here. 

6. his envy of God: As Margret Berger points out in her Hildegard of Bingen. On Natural Philosophy and 
Medicine (Cambridge, 1999), p. 24, this phrase <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be interpreted as ‘God’s punitive zeal’.

a phrase does not fit the context so well, it occurs in other writings of Hildegard, for instance in The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of 
Life’s Merits.

8. ancient counsel... man: Hildegard’s notion of the ‘ancient counsel’ indicates her belief in the ‘absolute 
predestination of Christ’, the doctrine that <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> whether or not the Fall had taken

In other words, there is the stench of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> mingled with the

11. <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> their song back into harmony: The Latin reads ‘cantum in symphoniaferent’, which connects this idea 
with Hildegard’s ‘Symphonia’, and the notion of heavenly harmony in her theology of music. 

12. bad humours... illness: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to the humoral physiology of ancient and medieval medicine, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>

the use of the magic arts in Scivias I, 3 (see Introduction at II. 1). 


23. Songs from Symphonia 


1. 0 magne pater. Antiphon: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> Barbara Newman (ed.), Hildegard of Bingen. Symphonia, 2nd edn (Ithaca, 
1998), no. 6. In her useful notes to this song, Newman suggests that it is influenced by Genesis 2:18. 

2. O eterne deus. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 7. The song is based on the idea in Ephesians 1:22-3 that 
<span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> is appointed to be head over the Church, which is his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and limbs. This is then combined with an 
image of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> dawn derived from Psalm 110:3. 

3 . Ave Maria. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 8. 

4. O clarissima mater. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 9. The ‘star of the sea’ is a traditional image for 
Mary. 

5. O splendidissima gemma. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 10. Adam of St Victor uses the same image of 
the gem in a sequence for Christmas. 

6. Hodie aperuit. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 11. A song in which several very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> images (gate, 
woman, dawn, flower) are presented in rapid succession. The idea of the ‘closed gate’ derives from a vision in 
Ezekiel 44:2-3 where the prophet sees a gate shut after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has passed through it and hears that ‘the prince 
himself is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the Lord’. The serpent and the 
woman are from the story of Eve in the Garden of Eden. The Dendermonde manuscript begins the song with the 
very specific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘hodie’, ‘today’, rather than ‘ nunc ’, ‘now’, of other versions. 

7. Quia ergo femina. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 12. Newman (p. 273) argues that the ‘ ergo ’ shows that 
this is a sequel to the preceding antiphon. The ‘form of a woman’ is both the Platonic idea and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a suggestion 
of weakness, as in the openings of Hildegard’s letters and visionary works. 

8. Cum processit factura. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 13. There is a textual crux in the reading ‘joys of 
life’ Qgaudia vite) rather than ‘joys in you’ (‘g audio in te). 

9. O virga ac diadema. Sequence: Newman, Symphonia, no. 20. From an anecdote in the Canonization Protocol, 
there is evidence to suggest that this sequence was a particular favourite of Hildegard. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> 35, paragraph 9.2 of 
the Protocol. 

10. Spiritus sanctus vivificans vita. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 24. 

11. Caritas abundat. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 25. An alternative medieval spelling of the title is 
Karitas habundat. 

12. O gloriosissimi. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 29. 

13. O speculum columbe. Antiphon for John the Evangelist: Newman, Symphonia, no. 35. ‘The beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of 
the Lamb’ refers to the description ‘one of them, the disciple whom <span class="t5 t11 t21 t22 t28 hoverable">Jesus</span> loved’ in John 13:23. 

14. O dulcis electe. Responsory for John the Evangelist: Newman, Symphonia, no. 36. The phrase translated as 
‘on the greenness of the pastors of the Church’ (Latin ‘in viriditate pigmentariorum’) picks up the Hildegardian 
image of priests as ‘perfumers.’ 

15. O vis aeternitatis. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 1. The Dendermonde manuscript lacks a few pages 
at the beginning and it is possible that this song was the initial piece. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> the journal article by Peter Dronke,

II.4. The ideas of the sapiential literature of the Apocrypha lie behind this text, particularly Wisdom of Solomon 
8:1, which reads: ‘Wisdom reacheth from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> mightily: and sweetly doth she <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> all things’ and 
Ecclesiasticus 24:5-6, where Wisdom speaks: ‘I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the 
bottom of the deep.

1. And I saw...: Hildegard begins her vision appropriately with an opening formula that recalls the writings of 
the biblical prophets; cf. Ezekiel 1:4 or Revelation 5:1, 6, 11. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the alliteration of the /v/ consonants in

balance and cadence: ‘supra abyssum stabat. Et se ad orientem verterat, ita quod et orientem et austrum

nevertheless she is clearly in full control of both her content and her medium of its expression. 

3. writing tablet: The Latin tabula is here translated as ‘writing tablet’. Parchment was expensive and paper 
unavailable in this period. The essential note-taking tool <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> Roman times had been a wooden frame filled 
with wax that was used in conjunction with a metal writing stylus; the writing on the soft wax <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be erased

of receiving the vision and writing it down on her tablet; only her secretary (Volmar) is seen actually using pen, 
ink and parchment. 

4. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the characteristic Hildegardian theological term ‘scientia Dei ’, ‘knowledge

a type of musical experience with which she was very familiar from her own songs and settings for the liturgy. 
The notion of the ‘sound’ of all varieties of music occurs in the letter to Bernard of Clairvaux (i). 

6. aforementioned: The frequent adjective ‘aforementioned’ or ‘aforesaid’ (' praedictus 0 is strange to modern 
ears, but serves to orient the medieval audience and prompt their memories as they listen to the reading of the 
text. 

7. trumpet blast... habitations: Hildegard’s vocabulary is heavily influenced by that of Revelation, Ezekiel and 
other apocalyptic and visionary writings. Cf. Revelation 8:12-13. 

8. lion... goat: The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> for ‘lion’ and ‘goat’ are leo and capricornus, both signs of the zodiac; they are referred 
to here not necessarily for any astrological <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> but rather for their astronomical and symbolic significance. 
The twelve signs of the zodiac are, it will be recalled, positions <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the belt of stars in the night sky against 
which observers can plot the changing position of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> at the various times of the year. 

9. the ‘misleader’: The Latin for ‘leader’, dux, is derived from the same root <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> duco, ‘I lead’, as seductor, 
hence the translation ‘misleader’. Hildegard is using etymology to emphasize her point. 

10. a cloud coming from the North: The North is the region of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> associated with the devil; the cloud that 
originates there is described as ‘aridus’, an apt choice of adjective to represent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and a term which in 
Hilldegard’s <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> contrasts effectively with her important and frequently encountered notion of ‘viriditas’, or 
‘greenness’, as used for instance in this <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> in Mercy’s speech against the fourth figure, Hardness of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> (see 
The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I, 8). 

11. ancient serpent: The ‘serpent’ is of course the devil, as in the <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the Fall in the biblical Genesis. 
‘Ancient Enemy’ (‘ antiquus hostis’) is a traditional term for the devil in medieval literature, with origins in 
patristic commentaries and sermons. 

12. the images... of vices: Here, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in her exegesis, Hildegard stresses the symbolic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of her vision; she 
sees symbolic images of vices rather than actual creatures, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the forms she sees, she chooses to focus 


on seven 



27. The Seven Vices and Virtues (from The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits ) 

1. The Wonders of the East: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> Richard Stoneman, Legends of Alexander the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> (London, 1994), pp. 20-24. 

2. So why dry up... for shame!: The Latin style is worthy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> in this passage. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> not a poem as such, it 
is remarkable for its strong rhythms and the AB AB AAA rhyme-scheme of its verbs, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as other internal 
rhymes in -um; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the alliteration on the [k] sounds as represented by the letters <c> and <q>: 

Et quare arescerem, cum omnem viriditatem habeam? Cur quasi in senili etate viverem, cum in iuventute 
floream? Quare pulchrum visum oculorum in cecitate ducerem? Quod si hocfacerem, erubescerem.’ 

[‘So why dry up when I possess all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of greenness? Why live in senile <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> age, when I can flourish in 
youthfulness? Why keep in the dark the beautiful vision of the eyes? If I did that, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> blush for shame!’] 

The language seems to echo and reinforce to the semi-aggressive statements of amor seculi. With an 
unmistakable and distinct voice, <span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> is characterized here as a kind of elemental wild man, 
speaking about positive forces such as ‘greenness’ but misusing them - in Hildegard’s view - for false purposes. 
This feature of a vice using the language of virtue to deceive her audience is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in Prudentius’s 
Psychomachia. 

3. 1 heard a voice respond to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> figure: The voice of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> virtue, ‘Heavenly Love’. 

4. The second figure... prey: The dog Hildegard depicts here appears to be a kind of coursing-hound or hunting- 
dog. As emerges in the later exegesis which follows the narrative of the vices, the second figure represents 
petulantia, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be translated as ‘Fickleness’, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the vice is described as chasing after whims and 
deceiving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with fine talk about laughter. The Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> has connotations of ‘impudence’, a 
personality feature which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> emerges - at least in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> - in the characterization of the figure here, for instance 
in the fact that the vice entices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> then deals them serious wounds. 

5. 1 heard a voice: As we learn later in the book, the virtue ‘True Discipline’ is speaking here. 

6. The third figure... clothing: The third vice represents ioculatrix, ‘Superficiality’, ‘Jocularity’ or ‘Amusemen’, a 
kind of superficial lack of gravity which the voice from the cloud condemns as ‘idolatry’. As with the other vices 
that employ the vocabulary of virtue to beautify their own speeches and actions, Superficiality attempts to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> 
himself attractive to his listeners by evoking the joy of <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and using this to justify his own behaviour. 

7. the response of the voice from the storm-cloud: Spoken by the virtue ‘Shame’. 

8. The fourth figure... motionless: The fourth image, the cloud of smoke, represents obduratio, Hardness of 
Heart’. 

9. So why should I labour... to pieces?: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> the rhyming prose in the original Latin (lines 194-5): ‘Quare ergo 
causa ullius laborarem, et me dilacerarem?’ (‘Why should I labour for any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> cause? Why tear myself to 
pieces?’). 

10. the voice from the aforementioned storm-cloud: The fourth virtue is ‘True Mercy’. 

11. the stone presents its moisture: The idea of ‘perspiration’ in stones is explicable as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the medieval 
notion of the four elements, namely: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> (i.e. solid matter), air (gases), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (energy) and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> (moisture), 
each of which is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in varying quantities in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> created thing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Gemstones in 22. 

12. The fifth figure... <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> head: The fifth vice is ignavia, ‘Lack of Spirit’. This figure with a large ear covering 
all its head is reminiscent of creatures with grotesquely exaggerated limbs in the Marvels of the East tradition. 

13. the response of the voice from the storm-cloud: The fifth virtue is ‘Divine Victory’. 

14. The sixth figure... burning brands: The sixth vice, ira, ‘Anger’, has flames issuing from its mouth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the 
monsters of legend, while the firebrands recall depictions of Anger in the traditional illustrations of vices in 
manuscripts of Prudentius’s Psychomachia. 

15. the response ofthe voice from the storm-cloud: The sixth virtue is ‘Divine Patience’; patience is the 
traditional remedy for anger in the psychomachia tradition. 

16. The seventh figure... quite naked: The seventh vice is inepta letitia, ‘Foolish Joy’. Similarities will be noted 


between the <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> members of this group of seven sins; here in particular Foolish Joy recalls the first, 
second and third figures of vice, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> follows on from the preceding figure ‘Anger’, as Hildegard explains 
later, ‘because when a person shows joy after being angry, he humiliates his enemies, who feel the insults 
heaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them all the more strongly when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him happy’. 

17. the response of the voice from the storm-cloud: The seventh virtue is ‘Desire for God’. 


28. The Voice from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> (from The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits ) 


1. black schism : Possibly a reference to the eighteen-year schism between Pope Alexander <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">III</span> and Emperor 
Frederick Barbarossa which began in 1159, shortly after Hildegard had started <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits. 

2. man... lion... ox... eagle... four: The four images of the man, the lion, the bull and the eagle from Ezekiel 1:10 
were traditionally interpreted as symbols of the four evangelists, for instance in the iconography of the 
illuminated gospel books of the early Middle Ages. In Hildegard these <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> theological symbols, each using 
traditional animal imagery to illustrate aspects of God: his goodness, power, sacrifice, and knowledge. 

3. The <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the activity of God. ..from God: The same idea is basic to the third <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of the trilogy, The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> 
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Works. 

4. For he alone knows all things... grace: Hildegard has a strong <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of immanence, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> and 
actively at <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the world. 

5. ‘The Lord... his enemies’: Isaiah 42:13. Hildegard has taken the image of the ‘mighty man’ from Isaiah and 
adapted it to her own vision, as she explains in the following paragraphs. 

6. Before the ancient days... destruction: A contrast is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> between the heights of the Lord’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> - as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to 
the living - and the carelessness of Pride ‘who attempts to climb before he has seen the ladder’. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in this 
passage the key concept of the ‘ancient counsel’ or plan that has been prepared beforehand against the forces of 
pride. 

7. But he prepared his quiver and arrows... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> of war: This is the traditional patristic image of the devil as an 
archer (Psalm 11:2 in the Authorized Version), here attempting to have his revenge for the fall from heaven. 

8. He then took up ‘the Word... <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> cease: The idea that ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> as a mighty man’ is linked now 
to the incarnation of Christ, when ‘the Word... became flesh’ (John 1:14). The battle with the enemy is seen as 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of active <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> against idle and inactive evil, and the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> becomes a prophecy of the apocalypse. 

9. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is of such stature’... and no end: At this point Hildegard returns to the details of the opening vision 
and explains them step by step, beginning with some reflections for the reader on how the eternity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is to 
be understood. 

10. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is eternal... a flaming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in judgement: By a series of associated images Hildegard connects eternity 
with fire, God’s power, rational thought, the senses, and judgement. A key influence is Psalm 104, the hymn to 
<span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and renewal from the Psalms, especially the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> ‘Who maketh... his ministers a flaming fire’ (Psalm 
104: 4; Authorized Version).

12. on the shoulder of his strength: Hildegard’s style here is extremely allusive and associative, but the main 
message seems to be that the shoulder is a symbol for the strength and justice of Christ. 

13. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the venomous seed of a man: The doctrine of the ‘venomous seed of a man’ contrasts with more

acquaintance with reflections on language, in particular the difference between a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> as an abstract meaning-

16. the <span class="t20 hoverable">Old</span> <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> was in shadow... anything different: An analogy is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> between the shadowy existence in the

of the body. 

17. From his knees to the calves of his legs he is in the earth.’... their sustenance: Hildegard draws an analogy 
between the supporting knees of the cosmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> and the sustaining strength of the earth, both of which can

compared with the mountain in Scivias 1 , 1 (25), or in the description of the cosmic egg in Scivias I, 3 (20), or in 
the letters to Henry, Bishop of Liege or Prior Dimo (14, 30). 

24. ‘He heard hidden words, which it is not permitted for anyone to speak’: II Corinthians 12:4. Hildegard at no 
point states clearly that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ‘caught up into paradise’ in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> refers to the Apostle Paul, which is the 
traditional view of this passage. Instead, Hildegard expands on the notion of ‘hidden words’ that are revealed to 
visionaries, as in her own case, and it is tempting to relate this passage to her short treatise on the ‘unknown 
language’ which she wrote in the 1150s before starting on The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits.

listed above suggest influence from Latin or German, e.g. vanix, ‘woman’, perhaps from Latin vanitas, ‘vanity’, 
falschin, ‘poet’, perhaps from Middle High German valsch, ‘false’, and sonziz, ‘apostle’, possibly related to the 
sonus or ‘sacred sound’ to which Hildegard frequently referred. For more information on Hildegard’s language,

Life’s Merits. 

ARNOLD OF BRESCIA A native of Brescia in Lombardy and a fiery reformer. Unlike Hildegard, he encouraged 
lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> not to accept the sacraments from priests guilty of simony; he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> preached the disendowment of

Rome and was excommunicated in 1148. In 1152 the Senate lost control of Rome, and Arnold was finally 
overthrown and hanged in 1155 during the pontificate of Pope Hadrian IV. 

ARNOLD, ARCHBISHOP OF COLOGNE Archbishop of Cologne before Rainald of Dassel, Arnold wrote to 
Hildegard requesting a copy of Scivias (see 32 and, for Hildegard’s response, 16).

Stahleck and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> had problems raising the tribute for Barbarossa’s Italian expeditions. On 1 November 1159

the dispute worsened and Arnold was killed during the violence that followed. 



AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO (354-430) St Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa, is probably the most famous 
of the four ‘Doctors of the Church’. His influence was enormous, and his numerous <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> include 
Confessions, On the Trinity, Christian Teaching, The Catechism of the Unlearned as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as numerous other

BENEDICTINE <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">ORDER</span> The traditional Western European monasticism, founded by St Benedict of Nursia (c. 
480-c. 550); Benedict’s Rule for Monasteries regulated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Office (Latin opus Dei), the daily pattern 
of worship and prayer divided into eight ‘offices’: matins at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the night, lauds at daybreak, prime, 
terce, sext and none during the day, vespers in the evening, and compline at sunset. The offices during the 
hours of daylight were interspersed with periods of <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and reading. Hildegard wrote a commentary on the 
Rule, probably in the period 1151-8. 

BERNARD OF CHARTRES (c. 1080-c. 1130) From c. 1114, master of the famous cathedral school of Chartres. 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his pupils, John of Salisbury, Bernard revered the arts and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of ancient Greece 
and Rome which he saw as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> exceeding that of his own day; for Bernard, his contemporaries were ‘dwarfs, 
standing on the shoulders of the giants’. 

BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX (1090-1153) Born in Burgundy, Bernard of Fontaines became famous under the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the Cistercian monastery he founded in 1115 and ruled as abbot until his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> in 1153. The most 
important Cistercian of his time, he wrote numerous works, including letters, sermons, satirical <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> and 
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> writings. An ascetic in his early years, Bernard became more politically involved after 1128, 
intervening in disputes between important figures in the Church. In 1140 his influence led to the 
condemnation of the teachings of Peter Abelard at the Council of Sens. After the election in 1145 of Pope 
Eugenius III, a Cistercian from Clairvaux, Bernard undertook preaching tours against heresy in the 
Languedoc, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Albis. From 1146 to 1147 he preached the Second Crusade, which 
subsequently failed in 1149. In this period he secured the acceptance of Hildegard’s writings at the Synod of 
Trier (1147-8). 

BERNARD SILVESTER Bernardus Silvestris, poet and philosopher. Of the same generation as William of 
Conches, Gilbert of Poitiers and John of Salisbury. Little is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> apart from reminiscences of 
contemporaries. He taught at Tours, probably between 1130 and 1140, and had some connections with 
Chartres. His major <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is the allegorical poem Cosmographia. 

BESANQON A papal embassy from Hadrian IV met Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his chancellor, Rainald 
of Dassel, at the Diet (Assembly) of Besangon in October 1157, and a dispute arose over whether the emperor 
should receive the imperial crown as a benefice (Latin beneficium) from the pope. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Part</span> of the problem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> 
have been Rainald’s inflammatory translation of the ambiguous term benficium as ‘fief rather than as ‘gift’. 
The row provoked the emperor into asserting his rights by sacred Roman <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> to the free crown of the ‘holy 
empire’, and it contributed to the later schism between emperor and pope from 1159 to 1177. 

BOETHIUS (c. 480-C.524) The Roman statesman and Neoplatonist philosopher; author of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> on the Greek 
science of Euclid, Porphyry and Aristotle, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as his prison writing The Consolation of Philosophy, which 
was widely read in the Middle Ages. In his theological writings, the Opuscula sacra, he wrote on the Trinity 
and the Person of Christ. 

BONIFACE, SAINT (c. 675-754) Wynfrith of Wessex, England, later <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as Saint Boniface. The ‘Apostle of 
Germany’, he was martyred in 754 at Dokkum in Frisia. In c. 746 he had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Archbishop of 
Mainz. <span class="t6 hoverable">Since</span> her convent lay <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the diocese of Mainz, Hildegard held the memory of Boniface in 
particular respect and wrote an antiphon in his honour. 

<span class="t24 hoverable">BOOK</span> OF <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">DIVINE</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">WORKS</span> Latin title Liber divinorum operum. Alternative title De operatione Dei (‘On the 
Activity of God’). Hildegard’s third large-scale visionary work, written in the period 1163-73/4 and divided 
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> parts covering the position of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the cosmos in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> scheme of 
things. There are four manuscripts: (1) the Gent manuscript (Gent, University Library, cod. 241), important 
because it is evidently the original copy dictated or written by Hildegard and then heavily corrected; (2) 



Troyes, Bibliotheque municipale, cod. 683, originally from Clairvaux; (3) the Riesenkodex; and (4) the Lucca 
manuscript, important for its illustrations. 

<span class="t24 hoverable">BOOK</span> OF LIFE’S MERITS Latin title Liber vitae meritorum, sometimes translated as ‘The <span class="t24 hoverable">Book</span> of the Rewards 
of Life’. The second of Hildegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> visionary works, written in 1158-63, it centres on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> figure

Especially concerned with ethical issues, five of its six 
parts or ‘books’ consist of dialogue-contests between 35 opposing pairs of vices and virtues, arranged in 
groups of five, seven or eight pairs. The theme of the sixth <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> is eschatology and the joys of heaven. Four 
of the six manuscripts are from the twelfth century and are associated with monasteries <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to 
Hildegard: (1) the Dendermonde codex from the Abbey of Villers; (2) the Berlin manuscript (Berlin, SB 
Preuss. Kulturerbes cod. lat. theol. 727) associated with St Jacob in Mainz; (3) the Trier manuscript (Trier, 
Seminarbibliothek cod. 68) from the monastery of St Eucharius in Trier; and (4) the Riesenkodex from the 
Rupertsberg. 

CAESARIUS OF ARLES (c. 470-542) Writer and churchman. Archbishop of Arles from 502. His writings, 
particularly his sermons directed at a popular audience, were influential in the early medieval period. 

CALLISTUS <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">III</span> Abbot John of Struma. The third ‘antipope’ of Frederick Barbarossa’s reign; elected in 1168 as 
successor to Paschal III. 

CANONS REGULAR or AUGUSTINIAN CANONS The Rule of St Augustine, a <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> attributed to Augustine of 
Hippo, became popular during the pontificate of Gregory VII, and led to the foundation of communities of 
clerks <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as canons regular, or Augustinian canons, in the eleventh century. 

CANOSSAThe castle near Reggio/Emilia in Northern Italy where Henry IV, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Germany, did penance 
before Pope Gregory <span class="t2 t20 t24 t26 hoverable">VII</span> in February 1076. The event is emblematic of the strained relationship between 
emperor and pope which was to dog the political <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the twelfth century. 

CATHARISM A religious movement that broke <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from the Catholic Church and was condemned as heretical.

While their clergy (‘the perfect’) were very ascetic, their laity (the ‘believers’) were reported to be extremely 
lax. The movement spread to Germany from the 1140s. Despite some unconscious dualist tendencies, 
Hildegard’s theology was based on the idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> unity and as the centre of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Mary (1156-9). Elisabeth corresponded with the older Hildegard for 
support and encouragement. She became magistra (abbess) of her community in 1157. 

ERIGENA (ERIUGENA) John the Scot (c. 810-c. 877). Theologian and philosopher who attempted to reconcile 
the Neoplatonist idea of emanation (i.e. the origin of everything that exists from the One) with the Christian 
idea of creation. His greatest work, Periphyseon, or the Division of Nature, was possibly <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to 
Hildegard; she perhaps knew his ideas through excerpts in the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of Honorius of Autun.

Abbey of Clairvaux under Bernard. On his election as Pope he refused to recognize the Roman Senate and 
had to flee from Rome to Farfa and Viterbo and then in 1147 to France, where he commissioned Bernard to 
preach the Second Crusade. Eugenius held synods at Paris (1147), Trier (1147-8) where he personally read 
out and approved Hildegard’s writings, Rheims (1148) where Gilbert Porreta’s writings were scrutinized for 
heresy, and Cremona (1148), where he excommunicated Arnold of Brescia, now leader of the Senate. In 1149 
he was able to return briefly to Rome, and again in 1153, when he died there. Essentially a reformer and 
pious Cistercian, he exchanged a number of letters with Hildegard after the Synod of Trier.

military action by imperial troops in German lands against monastic supporters of the pope. With the aim of 
establishing an imperial state in Lombardy, Barbarossa undertook six major Italian expeditions. In 1162 he 
took Milan. In 1167 he captured Rome, but had to withdraw because of a malaria epidemic. In the end, he

Frederick Barbarossa died while on the Third Crusade in 1189. 

GEBENO OF EBERBACH Eberbach, in the Rheingau, was a large Cistercian monastery with which Hildegard 
had personal contacts. She wrote to Abbot Ruthard in the 1150s and sent a letter of encouragement to the 
monks in the 1160s, a period when monasteries supporting the pope suffered oppression from imperial 
troops. In 1220, Prior Gebeno of Eberbach composed his Mirror of Future Times, or Pentachronon (i.e. The 
Five Ages), <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of which consists of extracts from Hildegard’s apocalyptic or prophetic writings, including 
such correspondence as the letter to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Conrad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">III</span> (c. 1150; 34) and the letter to the Cologne clerics (c.

commentator and scholastic theologian. After studying under Bernard of Chartres and Anselm of Laon, he 
became a well-known master at Paris. In 1142 he was appointed Bishop of Poitiers. Interested in logic and 
the language of theology, his statements in his commentary on Boethius’s opuscula that ‘God is one’ and

reacted by electing their own ‘antipopes’. 

GREGORY IX (c. 1148-1241) Pope from 1227. During his pontificate, in 1233, the canonization protocol was 
commissioned to provide evidence for Hildegard’s sanctity. This was rejected on its completion and returned 
for revision in 1237, but the revised version apparently <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> reached Pope Innocent IV, who wrote a letter 
in 1243 asking for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> claim to be submitted. 

GUIBERT OF GEMBLOUX (German name: Wibert) (1124/5-1213) Writer and monk of Gembloux near Namur 
in Flanders. Extremely learned, he was considerably influenced by the Latin classics in his style of writing. 
During the 1170s, Hildegard’s reputation reached Guibert and he became a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> admirer of her work. From 
1175, therefore, he began a correspondence with her which culminated in a visit to the Rupertsberg in the 
autumn of that year. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> prepared the Thirty-Eight Questions with the monks of the monastery of

HADRIAN IV, POPE (c. 1100-59) Nicholas Breakspear, the only English Pope. In 1154, he secured the expulsion 
of Arnold of Brescia from Rome and in 1155 obtained homage from Frederick Barbarossa before agreeing to 
his coronation as Emperor. In 1157 his legates met Frederick at Besangon and delivered his claim that the 
Emperor held his position as a ‘benefice’ from the Pope. This led to a severe dispute, which eventually 
became a schism during the pontificate of Alexander III. Hildegard wrote an admonitory letter to him on his 
election to the papal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> in 1154. 

HARTWIG, ARCHBISHOP OF BREMEN Hartwig of Stade, Archbishop of Bremen 1148-68. His sister was 

Richardis of Stade, the nun and friend of Hildegard at Disibodenberg. Their parents were Rudolf I, Margrave 
of Stade in North Germany (d. 1124) and Margravine (or Marchioness) Richardis, originally of Spanheim- 
Lavanttal (d. 1151); the Margravine’s second cousin was Jutta of Spanheim. After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of his brother 
Rudolf in 1144, Hartwig was involved in an inheritance dispute with Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, who 
imprisoned him. On his appointment in 1148, he aimed to extend the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his archbishopric in

Barbarossa for refusing to perform military service on the imperial expedition to Italy. In 1166 he supported 
the revolt in Saxony against Henry the Lion.

history and Church doctrine, divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> parts or ‘books’ of six, seven and thirteen visions

TENGSWICH OF ANDERNACH Tengswich, or Tengswindis, was Mistress of Sankt Marien, a <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of canons 
regular at Andernach in the Rhine Valley north of Bingen. In a letter dated 1148-50 (no. 52 in the Collected 
Letters ), Tengswich criticized Hildegard’s hierarchical attitudes, in particular her refusal to allow girls from 
lower down the social scale to join her community at Disibodenberg. She <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> asked whether it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that 
on feast <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> Hildegard allowed her nuns to wear rings and diadems decorated with allegorical figures. This 
question, it is thought, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> reflect accounts heard by Tengswich of a performance of The Play of the Virtues.
