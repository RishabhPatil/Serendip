PREFACE
Tantra is a major development in the evolution of
Indian <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> inasmuch as it represents a
determined attempt at reconciling the apparent points of
conflict among the different schools of philosophy that
came up after the age of the Epics. Tantra seeks to
synthesize the monism of the Advaita with the dualism
of the Samkhya, enrich Jnana with the rasa of Bhakti,
join <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> to her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

rights of Matter. It recovers the lost heritage of the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Veda which lays emphasis <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the commonalty

The principle
of Tantra is to reject nothing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has created, to

the Divine. Unlike many of the older systems Tantra
is highly rational in its approach; it asks for no <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in
advance. It is a self-verifying science of the development
of natural energies into their supernatural terms leading
to a cosmic enjoyment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> consciousness.

The Kularnava is an important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> in one of the traditions of Tantra with a pronouncedly practical bent of
thought.

privilege that has been given to him, e.g. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> birth in
which the being becomes conscious of himself and is
offered a choice: a choice between stagnation and rapid
progression towards his Godhead. He is warned of the
consequences of losing himself in the rounds of transient
excitements and pleasures He is also put on guard against
the many pseudo-paths that abound in this world. He is

asked to purify himself and told how to do it. In unambiguous terms he is told that a wine-drinker is different
from the drinkers of ecstasy; the union of delight is
between the ascending Sakti and the presiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

these warnings, the adepts of the Tantra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem to
have anticipated the modern turn of mixing up sex with
spirituality. It is a pity that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> like this has not received

provides for the healthy growth of his mental faculties,
purification of his emotions and passions, orientation of
his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> faculties through ritual, japa, mantra and
upasana. Who is fit for the path of Tantra? Who is
competent to guide the novice on the double-edged razor
path? What is the responsibility of a Guru to a
disciple? These and other relevant questions are raised
and answered in a satisfying manner.
An attempt has been made in the following selections
to present such contents as are eminently helpful to the
needs of the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of today. Portions relating
to rituals, technicalities of special types of japa, etc. have
been kept out of the treatment so as not to tax the aspirant of the present times who has little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or energies
to devote himself to those practices, especially when it is
possible to achieve the same results by more psychological
means suited to the modern age and so elegantly presented in this text. Definitions of most of the important
concepts and terms in the Tantra Sastra, as given in the
text, will be found highly educative.

INTRODUCTION
T h e Kularnava is a leading and perhaps the
foremost Tantra of the Kaula School. It enjoys
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> reputation amongst <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of its class and

seventeen and the verses total 2058 according as
there are included or not vv. 123-144 in the tenth
Chapter. The Colophon however states that the

variant readings of importance have been given

the present edition that every difficult <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span>

been so considerably reduced as to render the
present edition a practical working text.
Another inducement for its publication was the

<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that there is in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> an English translation

publish this the Sanskrit-knowing reader can
compare the English translation with the T e x t
on which it is based. For this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> the size of
the present edition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Text</span> is that of the
proposed translation, which, if published, w i l l
be the same format as the Mahanirvana.
T h e Kularnava is w o r t h y of a close studyby those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> understand the tenets and

(vv. 1-121). Devi tells Shiva of how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> a r e

conditions prescribed the Sadhana with wine

The Kularnava is the most frequently cited

it is a leading authority on the Kaula Marga†
which is the most important and daring
formulation of the Shakta school of the Agamas,
but also because of its comprehensive sweep
which takes in all the fundamentals of the
Tantra Sadhana, its underlying philosophy and
its many implications, ethical and social.

of topics but always stressing the practical side
of the agamic <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> and calling attention to
the urgency of following it in this very life.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> opens with a question by the Devi,

following cited by Bhaskara Raya (in his celebrated
commentary on the Lalita) seems to us the most h a p p y :
kulam Saktiriti proktam, akulam Siva ucyate; kule akulasya
sambandhah kaulamityabhidiyate. Kula, Shakti; Akula,
Shiva; the relation of Akula w i t h Kula i.e. the harmonious relation of Shiva and Shakti is Kaula.

the equipollence of Shiva and Shakti, not Shiva alone or
Shakti alone, not to the Static alone or to the Dynamic
alone.

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Each Tradition has its own God-given

each Mantra is granted by the Deity presiding

In a crowning peroration of memorable

bliss issues out of this meet of the Kundali
Shakti and the Moon of Pure-Consciousness.
What flows from this Lotus in the supreme

only liquor.

Deity, to summon Her to accept what is
proffered, to receive Her in a fitting manner and
adore Her pleasingly, requires a preparation,
outer and inner, worked out in the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or

embodied in the Scripture. He is <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of devotion
for the Guru, and for the Deity. And he has
control over himself, well-regulated in his life.
The mysteries of the Agamas, which are not all
openly declared in the Sastras, are known to
him. He is <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of fervour for worship. <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">Worship</span> shall not be done as a routine or as a part

looks forward to the adoration with eagerness,
with joy. And when he worsh.ips he is alive
with the instruction of the Guru for it is the
Guru who puts him in contact w i t h the Deity and
to be conscious of his instruction is to enliven the
link forged by him. Pure of heart, superbly
joyous, devoid of anger and unsteadiness, rejecting the inferior ritual, cheerful of countenance,
he worships. He offers and adores with devotion.
Devotion does not come or grow in day. Even
when it is intense it does not last. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> and

<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> that feels divine. To t r u l y

the Divine, one must become a w a r e of one's own
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of divinity. Such a worshipper attains
Fulfilment as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Release.
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">Worship</span> must be performed in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> which
is <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from distractions and disturbances, <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span>
from crowd. The worshipper shall seat himself
in a happy position which gives stability to the

Prior to
beginning the ceremony he shall, with an unagitated mind, visualise himself seated in the
jewelled abode of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Mother in the

paraphernalia required for the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> and
perform the Puja according to the command of
the Guru.
Before proceeding to the worship, however,
there is an indispensable process of purification
which is fivefold in character; purification of
oneself, purification of the place, purification of
the materials used, purification of the Mantras
and purification of the Deity. Purification of

oneself is both outer and i n n e r ; the outer bybath and the inner by the purification of the
elements, bhutasuddhi, by p r a n a y a m a and nyasa
and other prescribed methods. T h e <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> is sanctified by cleaning, wiping,
anointing into a shine of the m i r r o r , decoration
with flowers, incense, camphor, lights and
colours. The substances <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> for <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> shall
be purified by prescribed methods of sprinkling
with sanctified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> reciting the Mantras,
with mudra etc. The Mantras that are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> are
to be purified* by appropriate means. And
lastly, the Deity to be worshipped is also to be
purified, by placing it on the seat, making it
whole, i.e. by invoking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Deity into
it, sprinkling w i t h sanctified w a t e r along with
recital of the Mulamantra, performance of nyasa
etc. in the prescribed manner. Adorning it with
ornaments, <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> of incense, lights etc. follow
afterwards.
After this elaborate and comprehensive
purification, attention should be paid to the
drawing of the significant circles, mandalas,
the proper placement and utilisation of the
various substances, singly and in combination;
the various cosmic Powers are invoked and the
prescribed Mantras repeated in their due <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span>
with sacred deference. The fraternity of the
Gurus † is to be invoked. And after sanctifying
* Purification, of the Mantra is the performance of Japa
of the letters of the alphabet w h i c h compose the Matrikamantra, once in t h e i r regular order, and once again in the
opposite, by l i n k i n g the letters of the Mulamantra w i t h
them.

meditation.* When identification with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

Worship, puja, <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> and collective,
plays a central part in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the Kaula.
There are different rituals for daily worship,
for the fortnightly and the monthly sessions.
Special rituals are prescribed for special occasions like the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of religious festivals, birthdays of one's own, of the Guru, the Parama
Guru etc. All are to be observed to the best of
one's ability, one's resources, the circumstances,
the times, the customs. In the selection,
assemblage and utilisation of the ingredients of
worship, the utmost care is to be exercised.
Much more than the material side of the
worship, the upasaka has to be careful of his
psychological <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and soul. Especially
in the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> w i t h the Five M's, it is laid down
that they are to be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> as prescribed purely for
the delectation of the Deity; if <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> creeps in
then it becomes a sinful act. T h e worshipper
shall bow down to the woman, who is to be
worshipped in certain rituals - m a r k that she
may be of any age from one year onwards for
purposes of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the maiden, kumari

be first invoked in her and then the <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span>

The Yantra is an essential part of the Kaula

himself w i t h the Devi is present. Millions are
the attendants charged by Him with the protection of the Kula Dharma and of those who adhere
to it. T h e y are ever pleased when they are
remembered and given their due in worship.
Some of them, the major deities, are to be
invoked in the prescribed forms and worshipped.
Before entering the r i t u a l of <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> the
initiate shall cleanse himself w i t h purificatory
bath. He shall seat himself in the prescribed
manner and abstain from loose unconnected
talk. He shall not <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> before-hand. He shall
not lack in devotion and shall not be tainted
with greed in any form. He shall not offer
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> in the presence of one who is not
qualified to participate in the r i t u a l i.e. the
pasu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> still in the a n i m a l stage as he is

It makes a big difference in the Kaula
<span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the worshipper is an enlightened <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> in the ways of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> or

who devotedly remembers, " M y Guru is Shiva
Himself who grants liberation and e n j o y m e n t " ,
fulfilment is not far off
All objects fructify in
him who has supreme devotion to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and

to Mahadeva, to one's own mother and father, so
is devotion to be had to one's own Guru. Look
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Guru and his wife as your parents, as
the very Narayana and Lakshmi, as Brahma and
Saraswati, as Shiva and Girija. Not by sacrifice,
gifts, askesis, pilgrimage are all siddhis obtained
in the manner they are by devotion to the Guru.
As the steady devotion for the Guru grows, so
grows one's knowledge.
Why the pains of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> pilgrimages? Why
the observances that emaciate the body? All the
fruit anticipated from such austerities can be
easily obtained by motiveless service to the
Guru. The Sruti declares that for those who
seek for fulfilment and liberation, who aspire to
attain to Brahma, Vishnu and Isha, devotion to
the Guru is the Path and no other. Like <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>

When the Guru is present no tapas is
necessary; neither is fasting nor observances;
neither pilgrimage nor purificatory bath. To
the Guru, you shall not command nor talk in the

any business of purchase and sale or borrow and

When the Guru is present, do not proceed to

fruitless When you hold the lotus of his feet on
your head, you have no burden to carry. You
have only to act as per his c o m m a n d ; for the
Guru is indeed the command.
What you hear elsewhere regarding Mantras
and Agamas report to him and accept only what
is approved by h i m and reject what is not.
What he speaks from his own knowledge, do not
<span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of that secret to others; to talk of it is to
break the understanding. Feel one with the
Guru and not as another; and do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to all as

KULARNAVA TANTRA

Do not approach royalty, the Deity and the
Guru empty-handed. Offer in the measure of
your capacity, fruit, flower, cloth and the like.
Regard the Shakti of the Guru, the Guru's
son, his elder brother as the Guru himself. The
knower of the self shall look after the younger
brother of the Guru as his own son. Bow to the
Teacher of the Kula, to the eldest and the
youngest of the Guru, to one who is almost like a
Guru, as to your own Guru. Elder in the sacrifices, elder in order, elder in Kula, the eldest of
the Guru's sons, these are the four elders.
Respect them in that order, in the prescribed
manner.
To the elders like your father, mother and
other worthy relations, express your sentiment
by getting up, prostration and so on But should
you pose to be a teacher yourself, then these
acts become i l l of you.
Attained to the status of the Lord, pati, do
not bow down to any in the grade of the animal,
pasu He who attains to the status of the Guru
by meditation on the Mantra of the Padukat he
is to be esteemed as the Guru.

104

the monkey which strains, jumping from branch
to branch, and reaches the fruit. The path of
jnana is like that of the bird which flies straight
and rests on the fruit quickly.
Initiation, diksa, is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> k i n d s : initiation

Initiation and instruction by touch is likened
to the slow nourishing of its young by the bird
with the w a r m t h of its wings.
Initiation and instruction by sight is like the
nourishing of its young by the fish through its
seeing alone.
Initiation and instruction by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> (subtle
impingement) is like the nourishing of its young
by the tortoise by only thinking of t h e m .
The disciple receives the Grace according
to the impact of the Shakti, saktipata; where
there is no impact of sakti, there is no fulfilment.
Altogether, diksa, initiation, that gives
liberation is said to be of seven k i n d s : diksa
through r i t u a l ; through letter; through special
emanation (kala); through touch; through
speech; through s i g h t ; through thought.
Diksa is also classified as f o l l o w s : samaya,
when it authorises the disciple to help the Guru
manually in puja etc.; putrika when it enjoins
on him to perform the ritual indicated; sadhika,
when it initiates h i m in the inner sadhana;
vedhaka, when it impinges subtly; purna-acharya
when it vests on one the <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> competence of a
teacher; nirvana, when it leads to laya through
sadhana.
Eightfold again is diksa through outer ritual

in which kunda fire-bowl, mandapa, enclosure,
kalasa jar etc., are used; prescribed means are

Consciousness. The <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of godhood <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of
delight is <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the child (of the Guru). This is
the varnamayi diksa which removes all bonds.
Kala diksa is also threefold* to be done as
prescribed. Beginning from the base of the feet
up to the knee, it is nivrtti kala; from the knee
to the navel it is pratistha; from navel to the
neck it is vidya; from the neck to the forehead
it is santi; from there to the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> it is
santyatita.

The <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> shall effect the vedha (subtle
impact) following the method received from
the Guru. In a moment will the disciple in
bonds get freed from them. This is intense,
tivra, initiation yielding liberation.
Merely by remembrance on the part of the
Guru, proficient in the vedha, the disciple has
his <span class="t2 t5 t8 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">sin</span> severed; this is the highly intense,
tivratara diksa. Released from external activity
he falls on the ground instantly; a godly <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span>
arises in him and he comes to know everything.
Whatever is there at that moment of impact, he
experiences it himself, but on waking up he is

releases from the bonds of birth, yields the

Of one so struck six are the states described:

this initiation shall not be given to anybody and

Duly worshipping the circle of the Kula with
appropriate ingredients of Kula worship, the
Guru shall show it to the disciple. This is the
kauliki diksa, initiation of the Kaula.
Filling the mouth with the substance for

PURASCHARANA*
Among the various lines of self-elevation
prescribed to the seekers of the Truth, the
Kularnava lauds the Japa as the pre-eminent and
invests it with the sanctity and efficacy of a
yajna, sacrifice, for attaining the fourfold <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> viz. dharma, Right, artha, Wealth, Kama,
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">Desire</span> and moksa, liberation. All other means
can be <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> out and only the means of mantra i.e.
japa of mantra resorted to which is sure to yield
success if carried out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> blemish But if it
is allowed to be tarnished with fault then its
fruit is indeed inauspicious. Japa is the happy
giver of enjoyment, salvation, self-fulfilling
wish. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> practise the Yoga of Japa and

ridden heavily with unhappiness, doing Japa of

w i l l attain happiness. Daily puja at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

If any of these
limbs are lacking, make up for it with appropriate increase of Japa as prescribed. For no
fulfilment is possible if there be want of l i m b ;
hence attempt to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> it right by Japa w i t h

the b o d y ' and 'bathing the entire b o d y ' in the
nectar of union of Kundali and Shiva Pranayama
is infinitely potent when combined w i t h japa
and dhyana. Austerities, pilgrimages, sacrifices,
charities, observances are not worth even a
fraction of such Pranayama. All sin, mental,
verbal or physical, is burnt up in only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

As i m p u r i t y of the mental is
burnt away when it is blown upon, the sins of
the senses are burnt out by the control of prana.
Whatever action is done by one who is purified
by Pranayama, that fructifies, undoubtedly, even
if done effortlessly. He who does this practice
regularly in accordance with the direction in the
Agama, attains the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of godhood and acquires
perfection in Mantra, mantrasiddhi.
Seeing h i m
who performs japa of the Mantra as prescribed

being cognisant of these defects there is no fulfilment however much he may practise.
There are ten processes for the eradication
of these defects of Mantra: giving birth, giving
life, striking making aware, ceremonial bath,
cleansing of i m p u r i t y , satisfying, libation,
lighting, covering in protection. As weapons
rubbed on the whetstone get sharpened, Mantras
subjected to these processes acquire bloom.

lays down what is to be eaten, what is to be
offered, the vegetable, roots, fruit, barley etc.
