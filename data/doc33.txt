INTRODUCTION.

In the Introduction to the first volume of the translation of the
'Vedânta-Sûtras with Sankara's Commentary' (vol. xxxiv of this Series) I
have dwelt at some length on the interest which Râmânuja's Commentary
may claim--as being, on the one hand, the fullest exposition of what may
be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Theistic Vedânta, and as supplying us, on the other, with
means of penetrating to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of Bâdarâyana's Aphorisms. I do
not wish to enter here into a fuller discussion of Râmânuja's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in
either of these aspects; an adequate treatment of them would, moreover,
require considerably more space than is at my disposal. Some very useful
material for the right understanding of Râmânuju's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is to be found
in the 'Analytical Outline of Contents' which Messrs. M. Rangâkârya and
M. B. Varadarâja Aiyangâr have prefixed to the first volume of their
scholarly translation of the Srîbhâshya (Madras, 1899).

The question as to what the Stûras really teach is a critical, not a
philosophical one. This distinction seems to have been imperfectly
realised by several of those critics, writing in India, who have
examined the views expressed in my Introduction to the translation of
Sankara's Commentary. A writer should not be taxed with 'philosophic
incompetency,' 'hopeless theistic bias due to early training,' and the
like, simply because he, on the basis of a purely critical investigation,
considers himself entitled to maintain that a certain ancient document
sets forth one philosophical <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> rather than another. I have nowhere
expressed an opinion as to the comparative philosophical value of the
systems of Sankara and Râmânuja; not because I have no definite opinions
on this point, but because to introduce them into a critical enquiry
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be purposeless if not objectionable.

The question as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Sûtras is no doubt of some
interest; although the interest of problems of this kind may easily be
over-estimated. Among the remarks of critics on my treatment of this
problem I have found little of solid value. The main arguments which I
have <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth, not so much in favour of the adequacy of Râmânuja's
interpretation, as against the validity of Sankarâkârya's understanding
of the Sûtras, appear to me not to have been touched. I do not by any
means consider the problem a hopeless one; but its solution will not be
advanced, in any direction, but by those who will be at the trouble of
submitting the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Sûtras to a new and detailed
investigation, availing themselves to the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of the help that is to be
derived from the study of all the existing Commentaries.

The present translation of the Srîbhâshya claims to be faithful on the
whole, although I must acknowledge that I have aimed rather at making it
intelligible and, in a certain sense, readable than scrupulously
accurate. If I had to rewrite it, I should feel inclined to go even
further in the same direction. Indian Philosophy would, in my opinion,
be more readily and widely appreciated than it is at present, if the
translators of philosophical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> had been somewhat more concerned to
throw their versions into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> less strange and repellent to the
western reader than literal renderings from technical Sanskrit must
needs be in many passages. I am not unaware of the peculiar dangers of
the plan now advocated--among which the most obvious is the temptation
it offers to the translator of deviating from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> more widely than
regard for clearness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> absolutely require. And I am conscious of
having failed in this respect in more than one instance. In other cases
I have no doubt gone astray through an imperfect understanding of the
author's meaning. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is, that as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has hardly come for
fully adequate translations of comprehensive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the type of the
Srîbhâshya, the authors of which wrote with reference--in many cases
tacit--to an immense and highly technical philosophical literature which
is only just beginning to be studied, and comprehended in part, by
European scholars.

It gives me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pleasure to acknowledge the help which I have received
from various quarters in preparing this translation. Pandit Gangâdhara
Sâstrin, C. I. E., of the Benares Sanskrit College, has, with unwearying
kindness and patience, supplied me throughout with comments of his own
on difficult sections of the text. Pandit Svâmin Râma Misra Sâstrin has
rendered me frequent assistance in the earlier portion of my task. And
to Mr. A. Venis, the learned Principal of the Benares Sanskrit College,
I am indebted for most instructive notes on some passages of a
peculiarly technical and abstruse character. Nor can I conclude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
expressing my <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of obligation to Colonel G. A. Jacob, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
invaluable 'Concordance to the Principal Upanishads' lightens to an
incalculable degree the task of any scholar who is engaged in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

The lengthy explanation (vritti) of the Brahma-sûtras which was composed
by the Reverend Bodhâyana has been abridged by former teachers;

this present work.




1. Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the enquiry into Brahman.

In this Sûtra the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'then' expresses immediate sequence; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'therefore' intimates that what has <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (viz. the study of the
karmakânda of the Veda) constitutes the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (of the enquiry into
Brahman). For the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the enquiry into (lit.'the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to
know') Brahman--the fruit of which enquiry is infinite in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and
permanent--follows immediately in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of him who, having read the
Veda <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its auxiliary disciplines, has reached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
that the fruit of mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is limited and non-permanent, and hence has
conceived the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of final release.

The compound 'brahmajijñâsâ' is to be explained as 'the enquiry of
Brahman,' the genitive <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> 'of Brahman' being understood to denote the
object; in agreement with the special rule as to the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the
genitive case, Pânini II, 3, 65. It might be said that even if we
accepted the general <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the genitive case--which is that of
connexion in general--Brahman's position (in the above compound) as an
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be established by the circumstance that the 'enquiry'
demands an object; but in agreement with the principle that the direct
denotation of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is to be preferred to a <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> inferred we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
the genitive <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> 'of Brahman' as denoting the object.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Brahman' denotes the hightest <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> (purushottama), who is
essentially <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all imperfections and possesses numberless classes
of auspicious qualities of unsurpassable excellence. The term 'Brahman'

Sûtra 'Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the enquiry into religious duty' and concludes with
the Sûtra '(From there is) no return on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement'--
has, owing to the special character of the contents, a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
internal succession. This is as follows. At first the precept 'one is to
learn one's own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> (svâdhyâya)' enjoins the apprehension of that
aggregate of syllables which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'Veda,' and is here referred to
as 'svâdhyâya.' Next there arises the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> the
'Learning' enjoined is to be, and how it is to be done. Here there come
in certain injunctions such as 'Let a Brahnmana be initiated in his
eighth year' and 'The teacher is to make him recite the Veda'; and
certain rules about special observances and restrictions--such as
'having performed the upâkarman on the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> moon of Sravana or
Praushthapada according to prescription, he is to study the sacred
verses for four months and a half--which enjoin all the required details.

From all these it is understood that the study enjoined has for its
result the apprehension of the aggregate of syllables <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Veda, on
the part of a pupil who has been initiated by a teacher sprung from a

practises certain special observances and restrictions; and who learns
by repeating what is recited by the teacher.

And this study of the Veda is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a samskâra of the text,
since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the injunction 'the Veda is to be studied' shows that
the Veda is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> (of the action of studying). By a samskâra is
understood an action whereby something is fitted to produce some other
effect; and that the Veda should be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of such a samskaâra is
quite appropriate, since it gives rise to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the four
chief ends of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> action--viz. religious duty, wealth, pleasure, and
final release--and of the means to effect them; and since it helps to
effect those ends by itself also, viz. by mere mechanical repetition
(apart from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to which it may give rise).

The injunction as to the study of the Veda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> aims only at the
apprehension of the aggregate of syllables (constituting the Veda)
according to certain rules; it is in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> analogous to the recital
of mantras.

It is further observed that the Veda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> apprehended through reading
spontaneously gives rise to the ideas of certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> subserving
certain purposes. A person, therefore, who has formed notions of those
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> immediately, i.e. on the mere apprehension of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the
Veda through reading, thereupon naturally applies himself to the study
of the Mimâmsa, which consists in a methodical discussion of the
sentences constituting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Veda, and has for its result the
accurate determination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and their different
modes. Through this study the student ascertains the character of the
injunctions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of the Veda, and observes that all

immediately becomes aware that the Upanishad sections--which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part
of the Veda which he has apprehended through reading--refer to an
infinite and permanent result, viz. immortality, he applies himself to
the study of the Sârîraka-Mîmâmsâ, which consists in a systematic
discussion of the Vedânta-texts, and has for its result the accurate
determination of their sense. That the fruit of mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is transitory,
while the result of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something permanent, the
Vedanta-texts declare in many places--'And as here the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> acquired by

'Frail indeed are those boats, the sacrifices' (Mu. Up. I, 2, 7); 'Let a

13). 'Told' here means 'he is to tell.'--On the other hand, 'He who

path to go' (Svet. Up. VI, 15); 'Having known as separate his Self and
the Mover, pleased thereby he goes to immortality' (Svet. Up. I, 6).

But--an objection here is raised--the mere learning of the Veda with its
auxiliary disciplines gives rise to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that the heavenly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the like are the results of works, and that all such results
are transitory, while immortality is the fruit of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman.
Possessing such knowledge, a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> desirous of final release may at
once proceed to the enquiry into Brahman; and what need is there of a
systematic consideration of religious duty (i.e. of the study of the
Purva Mimâmsâ)?--If this reasoning were valid, we reply, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
desirous of release need not even apply himself to the study of the
Sârîraka Mîmâmsâ, since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is known from the mere reading of the
Veda with its auxiliary disciplines.--True. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> arises indeed
immediately (without deeper enquiry). But a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> apprehended in this
immediate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> is not raised above doubt and mistake. Hence a systematic
discussion of the Vedânta-texts must he undertaken in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that their
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> may be fully ascertained--We agree. But you will have to admit
that for the very same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> we must undertake a systematic enquiry
into religious duty!

THE SMALL PÛRVAPAKSHA.

But--a further objection is urged--as that which has to precede the
systematic enquiry into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> we should assign something which that
enquiry necessarily presupposes. The enquiry into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of duty,
however, does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> such a prerequisite, since a consideration of the
Vedanta-texts may be undertaken by any one who has read those texts,
even if he is not acquainted with works.--But in the Vedanta-texts there
are enjoined meditations on the Udgîtha and the like which are matters
auxiliary to works; and such meditations are not possible for him who is
not acquainted with those works!--You who raise this objection clearly
are ignorant of what kind of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> the Sârîraka Mîmâmsâ is concerned
with! What that sâstra aims at is to destroy completely that wrong
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is the root of all pain, for man, liable to birth, old
age, and death, and all the numberless other evils connected with
transmigratory existence--evils that spring from the view, due to
beginningless Nescience, that there is plurality of existence; and to
that end the sâstra endeavours to establish the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the unity
of the Self. Now to this knowledge, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of works--which is
based on the assumption of plurality of existence--is not only useless
but even opposed. The consideration of the Udgîtha and the like, which
is supplementary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only, finds a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the Vedânta-texts, only
because like them it is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of knowledge; but it has no direct
connexion with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> topic of those texts. Hence some prerequisite
must be indicated which has reference to the principal topic of the
sâstra.--Quite so; and this prerequisite is just the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of works;
for scripture declares that final release results from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> added. The Sûtra-writer himself says further on 'And there is need
of all works, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the scriptural statement of sacrifices and
the like' (Ve. Sû. III, 4, 26). And if the required <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> were not known,
one could not determine which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> have to be combined with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
and which not. Hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is just the necessary
prerequisite.--Not so, we reply. That which puts an end to Nescience is
exclusively the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, which is pure <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> and
antagonistic to all plurality. For final release consists just in the
cessation of Nescience; how then can works--to which there attach
endless differences connected with caste, âsrama, <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be
accomplished, means and mode of accomplishment, &c.--ever supply a means
for the cessation of ignorance, which is essentially the cessation of
the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that difference exists? That works, the results of which are
transitory, are contrary to final release, and that such release can be
effected through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only, scripture declares in many places;
compare all the passages quoted above (p. 7).

As to the assertion that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> requires sacrifices and other works,
we remark that--as follows from the essential contrariety of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
and works, and as further appears from an accurate consideration of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of scripture--pious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> can contribute only towards the rise of
the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of knowledge, in so far namely as they clear the internal
organ (of knowledge), but can have no influence on the production of the
fruit, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> itself. For the scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> concerned runs
as follows Brâhmanas <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know him by the study of the Veda, by
sacrifice, by gifts,' &c. (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22).

According to this passage, the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> only of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> springs up
through works; while another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> teaches that calmness, self-restraint,
and so on, are the direct means for the origination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> itself.
(Having become tranquil, calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and
collected, he is to see the Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Self (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 23).)

The process <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is as follows. After the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has been cleaned
of all impurities through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> performed in many preceding states of
existence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to special forms of reward, there arises in
him the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of knowledge, and thereupon--through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> itself
originated by certain scriptural texts--'Being only, this was in the
beginning, one only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a second' (Ch. Up. VI, I, 2); 'Truth,
Knowledge, the Infinite, is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Without parts,

Up. VI, 19);
'This Self is Brahman' (Bri. Up. II, 5, 19); 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that' (Ch. Up. VI,
9, 7), Nescience comes to an end. Now, 'Hearing,' 'reflection,' and
'meditation,' are helpful towards cognising the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of these Vedic
texts. 'Hearing' (sravana) means the apprehension of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
scripture, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with collateral arguments, from a teacher who
possesses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> insight, viz. that the Vedânta-texts establish the
doctrine of the unity of the Self. 'Reflection' (mananam) means the
confirmation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> oneself of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> taught by the teacher, by means
of arguments showing it alone to be suitable. 'Meditation'
(nididhyâsanam) finally means the constant holding of thai <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> before
one's mind, so as to dispel thereby the antagonistic beginningless
imagination of plurality. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of him who through 'hearing,'
'reflection,' and meditation,' has dis-dispelled the entire imagination
of plurality, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of Vedânta-texts puts an end to
Nescience; and what we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> require is a statement of the
indispensable prerequisites of such 'hearing,' 'reflection,' and so on.
Now of such prerequisites there are four, viz. discrimination of what is
permanent and what is non-permanent; the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> possession of calmness of
mind, self-restraint and similar means; the renunciation of all
enjoyment of fruits here below as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the next world; and the
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of final release.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> these the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> cannot arise; and they are

prerequisites. To sum up: The root of bondage is the unreal <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
plurality which itself has its root in Nescience that conceals the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is

THE SMALL SIDDHÂNTA.

To this argumentation we make the following reply. We admit that release
consists only in the cessation of Nescience, and that this cessation
results entirely from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. But a distinction has
here to be made regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the
Vedânta-texts aim at enjoining for the purpose of putting an end to
Nescience. Is it merely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of sentences which
originates from the sentences? or is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (upâsana) which has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> just referred to as its
antecedent? It cannot be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the former kind: for such
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> springs from the mere apprehension of the sentence, apart from
any special injunction, and moreover we do not observe that the
cessation of Nescience is effected by such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> merely. Our
adversary will perhaps attempt to explain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in the following way.
The Vedânta-texts do not, he will say, produce that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which
makes an end of Nescience, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the imagination of plurality is
not dispelled. And the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that such knowledge, even when produced,
does not at once and for every one put a stop to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality
by no means subverts my opinion; for, to mention an analogous instance,
the double appearance of the moon--presenting itself to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
affected with a certain weakness of vision--does not come to an end as
soon as the oneness of the moon has been apprehended by reason.
Moreover, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having come to an end, the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality is
powerless to effect further bondage, as soon as the root, i.e.
Nescience, has once been cut But this defence we are unable to admit. It
is impossible that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> should not arise when its means, i.e. the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> conveying knowledge, are once present. And we observe that even
when there exists an antagonistic imagination (interfering with the rise
of knowledge), information given by competent persons, the presence of
characteristic marks (on which a correct inference may be based), and
the like give rise to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which sublates the erroneous
imagination. Nor can we admit that even after the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> has
been apprehended, the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality may continue owing to some small
remainder of beginningless imagination. For as this imagination which
constitutes the means for the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality is itself false, it is
necessarily put an end to by the rise of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge. If this did not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, that imagination <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never come to an end, since there is
no other means but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to effect its cessation. To say that the
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality, which is the effect of that imagination, continues
even after its root has been cut, is mere nonsense. The instance of some
one seeing the moon double is not analogous. For in his <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the
non-cessation of wrong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> explains itself from the circumstance
that the cause of wrong knowledge, viz. the real defect of the eye which
does not admit of being sublated by knowledge, is not removed, although
that which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sublate wrong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is near. On the other hand,
effects, such as <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and the like, may come to an end because they can
be sublated by means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of superior force. Moreover, if it
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> arises through the dispelling of the
imagination of plurality, the rise of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> really never be

growth in the course of beginningless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> acquired an infinite
strength, and does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> admit of being dispelled by the
comparatively weak conception of non-duality. Hence we conclude that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which the Vedânta-texts aim at inculcating is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
other than the mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of sentences, and denoted by
'dhyâna,' 'upâsanâ' (i. e. meditation), and similar terms.

With this agree scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Having known it, let him
practise meditation' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 21); 'He who, having searched out
the Self, knows it' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Meditate on the Self as Om'
(Mu. Up. II, 2, 6); 'Having known that, he is freed from the jaws of
death' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 15); 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the Self only as his
world' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 15); 'The Self is to be seen, to be heard, to her
reflected on, to be meditated on' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 6); 'That we must
search out, that we must try to understand' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1).

(According to the principle of the oneness of purport of the different
sâkhâs) all these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> must be viewed as agreeing in <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> with the
injunction of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> contained in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> quoted from the Bri.
Up.; and what they enjoin is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> meditation. In the first and
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> passages quoted, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'having known' and 'having searched
out' (vijñâya; anuvidya) contain a mere reference to (not injunction of)
the apprehension of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of texts, such apprehension subserving
meditation; while the injunction of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

meditation' (prajñâm kurvîta) and 'he knows it.' In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the
clause 'the Self is to be heard' is a mere anuvâda, i.e. a mere
reference to what is already established by other means; for a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
who has read the Veda observes that it contains instruction about
matters connected with certain definite purposes, and then on his own
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> applies himself to methodical 'hearing,' in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> definitely to

same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the clause 'the Self is to be reflected upon' is a mere anuvâda
of reflection which is known as a means of confirming what one has
'heard.' It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only which all those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoin.
In agreement with this a later Sûtra also says, 'Repetition more than
once, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of instruction' (Ve. Sû. IV, I, I). That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
intended to be enjoined as the means of final release is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of meditation, we conclude from the circumstance that the terms
'knowing' and'meditating' are seen to be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of each other in
the earlier and later parts of Vedic texts. Compare the following
passages: 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as Brahman,' and 'he who knows
this shines and warms through his celebrity, fame, and <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of
countenance' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 1; 6). And 'He does not know him, for he
is not complete,' and 'Let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> meditate on him as the Self (Bri. Up. I,
4, 7). And 'He who knows what he knows,' and 'Teach me the deity on
which you meditate' (Ch. Up. IV, 1, 6; 2, 2).

'Meditation' means steady remembrance, i.e. a continuity of steady
remembrance, uninterrupted like the flow of oil; in agreement with the
scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which declares steady remembrance to be the means of
release, 'on the attainment of remembrance all the ties are loosened'
(Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2). Such remembrance is of the same character (form)
as seeing (intuition); for the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> quoted has the same purport as
the following one, 'The fetter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is broken, all doubts are
solved, and all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> perish when he has been seen who
is <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> and low' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). And this being so, we conclude that
the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'the Self is to be seen' teaches that 'Meditation' has the
character of 'seeing' or 'intuition.' And that remembrance has the
character of 'seeing' is due to the element of imagination
(representation) which prevails in it. All this has been <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth at
length by the Vâkyakâra. 'Knowledge (vedana) means <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (upâsana),
scripture using the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> in that sense'; i.e. in all Upanishads that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is enjoined as the means of final release is Meditation.
The Vâkyakâra then propounds a pûrvapaksha (primâ facie view), 'Once he
is to make the meditation, the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> enjoined by scripture being
accomplished thereby, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the prayâjas and the like'; and
then sums up against this in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'but (meditation) is established
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the term meditation'; that means--knowledge repeated more
than once (i.e. meditation) is determined to be the means of Release.--
The Vâkyakâra then goes on 'Meditation is steady remembrance, on the
ground of observation and statement.' That means--this knowledge, of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of meditation, and repeated more than once, is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
steady remembrance.

Such remembrance has been declared to be of the character of 'seeing,'
and this character of seeing consists in its possessing the character of
immediate presentation (pratyakshatâ). With reference to remembrance,
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> acquires the character of immediate presentation and is the
means of final release, scripture makes a further determination, viz. in
the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> Ka. Up. I, 2, 23, 'That Self cannot be gained by the study
of the Veda ("reflection"), nor by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> ("meditation"), nor by much
hearing. Whom the Self chooses, by him it may be gained; to him the Self
reveals its being.' This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says at first that mere hearing,
reflection, and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> do not suffice to gain the Self, and then
declares, 'Whom the Self chooses, by him it may be gained.' Now a
'chosen' one means a most beloved person; the relation being that he by
whom that Self is held most dear is most dear to the Self. That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
(bhagavân) himself endeavours that this most beloved <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> should gain
the Self, he himself declares in the following words, 'To those who are
constantly devoted and worship with <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> I give that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by which
they reach me' (Bha. Gî. X, 10), and 'To him who has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> I am dear
above all things, and he is dear to me' (VII, 17). Hence, he who
possesses remembrance, marked by the character of immediate presentation
(sâkshâtkâra), and which itself is dear above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> since the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> remembered is such; he, we say, is chosen by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
and by him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is gained. Steady remembrance of this kind
is designated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'devotion' (bhakti); for this term has the
same <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> as upâsanâ (meditation). For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> scripture and
smriti agree in making the following declarations, 'A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> knowing him
passes over death' (Svet. Up. III, 8); 'Knowing him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he here becomes
immortal' (Taitt. Âr. III, 12,7); 'Neither by the Vedas, nor by
austerities, nor by gifts, nor by <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> can I be so seen as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span>
<span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> seen me. But by devotion exclusive I may in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> be known and
seen in truth, O Arjuna, and also be entered into' (Bha. Gî. XI, 53, 54);
'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, O Pârtha, may be obtained by exclusive devotion'
(VIII, 22).

That of such steady remembrance sacrifices and so on are means will be
declared later on (Ve. Sû. III, 4, 26). Although sacrifices and the like
are enjoined with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the origination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (in accordance
with the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'They <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know,' Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22), it is only
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> which--being daily practised,
constantly improved by repetition, and continued up to death--is the
means of reaching Brahman, and hence all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> connected with the
different conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are to be performed throughout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> only
for the purpose of originating such knowledge. This the Sûtrakâra
declares in Ve. Sû. IV, 1, 12; 16; III, 4, 33, and other places. The
Vâkyakâra also declares that steady remembrance results only from
abstention, and so on; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> being 'This (viz. steady remembrance =
meditation) is obtained through abstention (viveka), freeness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

(kalyâna), freedom from dejection (anavasâda), absence of exultation
(anuddharsha); according to feasibility and scriptural statement.' The
Vâkyakâra also gives definitions of all these terms. Abstention (viveka)
means keeping the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> clean from all food, impure either owing to
species (such as the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of certain animals), or abode (such as <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
belonging to a Kândâla or the like), or accidental cause (such as <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
into which a hair or the like has fallen). The scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
authorising this point is Ch. Up. VII, 26, 'The <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> being pure, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> becomes pure; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> being pure, there results steady remembrance.'
Freeness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (vimoka) means absence of attachment to desires. The
authoritative <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> here is 'Let him meditate with a calm mind' (Ch.
Up. III, 14, 1). Repetition means continued practice. For this point the
Bhâshya-kâra quotes an authoritative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> from Smriti, viz.: 'Having
constantly been absorbed in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of that being' (sadâ
tadbhâvabhâvitah; Bha. Gî. VIII, 6).--By 'works' (kriyâ) is understood
the performance, according to one's ability, of the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
sacrifices. The authoritative passages here are 'This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who

4); and 'Him Brâhmanas seek to know by recitation of the Veda, by
sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22).--By
virtuous conduct (kalyânâni) are meant truthfulness, honesty, kindness,
liberality, gentleness, absence of covetousness. Confirmatory <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are
'By <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> he is to be obtained' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 5) and 'to them belongs

'dejection'; the contrary of this is 'freedom from dejection.' The
relevant scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is 'This Self cannot be obtained by one
lacking in strength' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 4).--'Exultation' is that
satisfaction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> which springs from circumstances opposite to those
just mentioned; the contrary is 'absence of exultation.' Overgreat
satisfaction also stands in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> (of meditation). The scriptural
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> for this is 'Calm, subdued,' &c. (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 23).--What the
Vâkyakâra means to say is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is realised only
through the performance of the duly prescribed works, on the part of a
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> fulfilling all the enumerated conditions.

Analogously another scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> says 'He who knows both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

the Immortal through knowledge' (Îs. Up. II). Here the term
'non-knowledge' denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> enjoined on the different castes and

The non-knowledge of which this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> speaks as being the means of
overcoming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> can only mean that which is other than knowledge, viz.

The appearance of plurality is due to avidyâ.

'Falsehood' (mithyâtva) belongs to what admits of being terminated by
the cognition of the real thing--such cognition being preceded by
conscious activity (not by mere absence of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or knowledge).
The snake, e.g. which has for its substrate a rope or the like is false;
for it is due to an imperfection (dosha) that the snake is imagined in
(or 'on') the rope. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> this entire world, with its

Scripture is of greater force than Perception

But, an objection is raised--how can knowledge, springing from the
sacred texts, <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about a cessation of the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference, in
manifest opposition to the evidence of Perception?--How then, we rejoin,
can the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is a rope and not a snake <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about,
in opposition to actual perception, the cessation of the (idea of the)
snake?--You will perhaps reply that in this latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there is a
conflict between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> forms of perception, while in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under
discussion the conflict is between direct perception and Scripture which
is based on perception. But against this we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ask the question how,

that one of them is due to a defective cause while the other is not: we

which admits of being accounted for in some other way; while that
cognition which affords no opening for being held unauthoritative and
cannot be accounted for in another way, is the 'sublating one [FOOTNOTE
25:1].' This is the principle on which the relation between 'what
sublates' and 'what is sublated' is decided everywhere. Now apprehension
of Brahman--which is mere intelligence, eternal, pure, free,
self-luminous--is effected by Scripture which rests on endless unbroken
tradition, cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be suspected of any, even the least,
imperfection, and hence cannot be non-authoritative; the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
bondage, on the other hand, with its manifold distinctions is proved by
Perception, Inference, and so on, which are capable of imperfections and

conclude that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage is put an end to by the apprehension
of Brahman. And that imperfection of which Perception--through which we
apprehend a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of manifold distinctions--may be assumed to be
capable, is so-called Nescience, which consists in the beginningless
wrong imagination of difference.--Well then--a further objection is
raised--let us admit that Scripture is perfect because resting on an
endless unbroken tradition; but must we then not admit that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
evidently presupposing the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of duality, as e.g. 'Let him who desires

refutation?--True, we reply. As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the Udgâtri and
Pratihartri breaking the chain (not at the same time, but) in
succession [FOOTNOTE 26:1], so here also the earlier <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> (which refer
to duality and transitory rewards) are sublated by the later <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which
teach final release, and are not themselves sublated by anything else.

force

The same reasoning applies to those passages in the Vedânta-texts which
inculcate <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the qualified Brahman, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

we reply, of those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as devoid of qualities.
'It is not coarse, not fine, not short, not long' (Bri. Up. III, 8, 8);
'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'That
which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from qualities,' 'that which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from stain'--these
and similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> convey the notion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being changeless, <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span>

But--an objection is raised--even the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'The True, knowledge,

that all the terms of the sentence stand in co-ordination, it follows
that they convey the idea of one <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (sense) only. If against this
you urge that the sentence may convey the idea of one <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> only, even
if directly expressing a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished by several qualities; we
must remark that you display an ignorance of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of language
which appears to point to some weakmindedness on your part. A sentence
conveys the idea of one <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (sense) only when all its constitutive

a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> possessing several attributes, the difference of these

us the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of imperative sentences, teach that in imperative sentences
belonging to ordinary speech all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> have an implied <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> only (not

something not established by other means; and hence in ordinary speech

substance only

We have so far shown that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a conflict between Scripture
and Perception and the other instruments of knowledge, Scripture is of
greater force. The fact, however, is that no such conflict is observed
to exist, since Perception itself gives rise to the apprehension of a
non-differenced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pure Being.--But how can it be

'There is a piece of cloth'--causes the apprehension of mere Being? If
there were no apprehension of difference, all cognitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have one

founded on perception, for they are the results of acts of cognition
occupying different moments of time, while the perceptional cognition
takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in one moment (is instantaneous).

<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it is the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the jar, or its difference from
other things, that is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of perception. And we must adopt the
former alternative, because the apprehension of difference presupposes
the apprehension of the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the thing, and, in addition,
the remembrance of its counterentities (i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> from which the
given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> differs). Hence difference is not apprehended by Perception;
and all judgments and propositions relative to difference are founded on
error only.

Difference--bheda--does not admit of logical definition

The Logicians, moreover, are unable to give a definition of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
as 'difference.' Difference cannot in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> be the essential

judgments as to its difference from everything else.--But, it may be
objected to this, even when the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is

depends on the remembrance of its counterentities, and as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as this

not formed!--Such reasoning, we reply, is inadmissible. He who maintains
that 'difference' is nothing but 'essential nature' has no right to
assume a dependence on counterentities since, according to him,

<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> really implies that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'the jar' and 'different' (in the

(dharma). For if it were that, we should have to assume that
'difference' possesses difference (i.e. is different) from essential

'Difference' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> showing itself incapable of logical definition, we are
confirmed in our <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that perception reveals mere 'Being' only.

Moreover, it appears that in states of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> such as 'Here is a
jar,' 'There is a piece of cloth,' 'The jar is perceived,' 'The piece of
cloth is perceived,' that which constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is Being
(existence; sattâ) and perception (or 'consciousness'; anubhûti). And we
observe that it is pure Being only which persists in all states of
cognition: this pure Being alone, therefore, is _real_. The differences,
on the other hand, which do not persist, are unreal. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is
analogous to that of the snake-rope. The rope which persists as a
substrate is real, while the non-continuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (which by wrong
imagination are superimposed on the rope) such as a snake, a cleft in
the ground, a watercourse, and so on, are unreal.

But--our adversary objects--the instance is not truly analogous. In the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the snake-rope the non-reality of the snake results from the
snake's being sublated (bâdhita) by the cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the substrate 'This is a rope, not a snake'; it does not result from the
non-continuousness of the snake. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the reality of the rope
does not follow from its persistence, but from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of its being not
sublated (by another cognition). But what, we ask, establishes the
non-reality of jars and pieces of cloth?--All are agreed, we reply, that
we observe, in jars and similar things, individual difference
(vyâvritti, literally 'separation,' 'distinction'). The point to decide
is of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> such difference is. Does it not mean that the judgment
'This is a jar' implies the negation of pieces of cloth and other
things? But this means that by this judgment pieces of cloth and other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are sublated (bâdhita). Individual difference (vyâvritti) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
means the cessation (or absence), due to sublation, of certain objects
of cognition, and it proves the non-reality of whatever has
non-continuous existence; while on the other hand, pure Being, like the
rope, persists non-sublated. Hence everything that is additional to pure
Being is non-real.--This admits of being expressed in technical form.
'Being' is real because it persists, as proved by the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the rope
in the snake-rope; jars and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are non-real because they are
non-continuous, as proved by the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the snake that has the rope for
its substrate.

From all this it follows that persisting <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only has real
being; it alone is.

Being and <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> are one. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is svayamprakâsa.

But, our adversary objects, as mere Being is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness,
it is different therefrom (and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there exists after all 'difference'
or 'plurality').--Not so, we reply. That there is no such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as
'difference,' we have already shown above on the grounds that it is not
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of perception, and moreover incapable of definition. It
cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be proved that 'Being' is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness.
Hence <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> itself is 'Being'--that which is.--This
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is self-proved, just because it is consciousness. Were it
proved through something else, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that like jars and
similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> it is not consciousness. Nor can there be assumed, for
consciousness, the need of another act of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> (through which
its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be established); for it shines forth (prakâsate)
through its own being. While it exists, consciousness--differing therein
from jars and the like--is never observed not to shine forth, and it
cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be held to depend, in its shining forth, on something
else.--You (who <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to the above reasoning) perhaps hold the
following view:--even when <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has arisen, it is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
only which shines forth--a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> expressed in sentences such as: the jar
is perceived. When a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> forms the judgment 'This is a jar,' he is
not at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> conscious of a <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which is not an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> and
is not of a definite character. Hence the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> which brings about the 'shining forth' of jars and other
objects, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> has a similar office as the approximation of the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to the eye or the other organs of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> (which is another
condition of perceptive consciousness). After this the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is inferred on the ground that the shining forth of the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is (not permanent, but) occasional only [FOOTNOTE 34:1]. And
should this argumentation be objected to on the ground of its implying
that consciousness--which is essentially of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of intelligence--
is something non-intelligent like material things, we ask you to define
this negation of non-intelligence (which you declare to be
characteristic of consciousness). Have we, perhaps, to understand by it
the invariable concomitance of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> and shining forth? If so, we
point out that this invariable concomitance is also found in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
pleasure and similar affections; for when pleasure and so on exist at
all, they never are non-perceived (i.e. they exist in so far only as we
are conscious of them). It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> clear that we have no <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself--just as the tip of a finger, although touching
other things, is incapable of touching itself.

All this reasoning, we reply, is entirely spun out of your own fancy,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any due consideration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of consciousness. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is,
that in perceiving colour and other qualities of things, we are not
aware of a 'shining forth' as an attribute of those things, and as
something different from consciousness; nor can the assumption of an
attribute of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'light,' or 'shining forth,' be proved in any
way, since the entire empirical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> itself can be proved only through
consciousness, the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of which we both admit. Consciousness,
therefore, is not something which is inferred or proved through some
other act of knowledge; but while proving everything else it is proved
by itself. This may be expressed in technical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> as follows--
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is, with regard to its attributes and to the empirical
judgments concerning it, independent of any other thing, because through
its connexion with other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> it is the cause of their attributes and
the empirical judgments concerning them. For it is a general principle
that of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that which through its connexion with the other is
the cause of the attributes of--and the empirical judgments about--the
latter, is itself independent of that other as to those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> points. We
see e.g. that colour, through its conjunction with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the like,
produces in them the quality of visibility, but does not itself depend
for its visibility on conjunction with colour. Hence <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
itself the cause of its own 'shining forth,' as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as of the
empirically observed shining forth of objects such as jars and the like.

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> and incapable of change.

This self-luminous consciousness, further, is eternal, for it is not
capable of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of non-existence--whether so--called antecedent
non-existence or any other form. This follows from its being
self-established. For the antecedent non-existence of self-established
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be apprehended either through <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or
anything else. If <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself gave rise to the apprehension of
its own non-existence, it could not do so in so far as 'being,' for that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> contradict its being; if it is, i.e. if its non-existence is not,
how can it give rise to the idea of its non-existence? Nor can it do so
if not being; for if <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself is not, how can it furnish a
proof for its own non-existence? Nor can the non-existence of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> be apprehended through anything else; for <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
cannot be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of anything else. Any instrument of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
proving the non-existence of consciousness, could do so only by making
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> its object--'this is consciousness'; but consciousness, as
being self-established, does not admit of that objectivation which is
implied in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'this,' and hence its previous non-existence cannot
be proved by anything lying outside itself.

As <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does not admit of antecedent non-existence, it
further cannot be held to originate, and hence also all those other
states of being which depend on origination cannot be predicated of it.

As <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is beginningless, it further does not admit of any
plurality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself; for we observe in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the presence of
something which is contrary to what invariably accompanies plurality
(this something being 'beginninglessness' which is contrary to the
quality of having a beginning--which quality invariably accompanies
plurality). For we never observe a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> characterised by plurality to
be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a beginning.--And moreover difference, origination, &c., are
objects of consciousness, like colour and other qualities, and hence
cannot be attributes of consciousness. Therefore, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> being
essentially <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only, nothing else that is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> can be its attribute. The conclusion is that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from difference of any kind.

The apparent difference between <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> and the conscious subject
is due to the unreal ahamkâra.

From this it further follows that there is no substrate of
consciousness--different from <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself--such as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
ordinarily mean when speaking of a 'knower.' It is self-luminous
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself which constitutes the so-called 'knower.' This
follows therefrom also that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not non-intelligent (jada);
for non-intelligence invariably accompanies absence of Selfhood
(anâtmatva); hence, non-intelligence being absent in consciousness,
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not non-Self, that means, it is the Self.

But, our adversary again objects, the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which expresses
itself in the judgment 'I know,' proves that the quality of being a
'knower' belongs to consciousness!--By no means, we reply. The
attribution to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of this quality rests on error, no less
than the attribution, to the shell, of the quality of being silver.
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> cannot stand in the relation of an agent toward itself:
the attribute of being a knowing agent is erroneously imputed to it--an
error analogous to that expressed in the judgment 'I am a man,' which
identifies the Self of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> with the outward aggregate of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
that bears the external characteristics of humanity. To be a 'knower'
means to be the agent in the action of knowing; and this is something
essentially changeful and non-intelligent (jada), having its abode in
the ahamkâra, which is itself a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> subject to change. How, on the
other hand, could such agency possibly belong to the changeless
'witness' (of all change, i.e. consciousness) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pure Being?
That agency cannot be an attribute of the Self follows therefrom also
that, like colour and other qualities, agency depends, for its own proof,
on seeing, i.e. consciousness.

That the Self does not fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere (is not an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of), the
idea of 'I' is proved thereby also that in deep sleep, swoon, and
similar states, the idea of the 'I' is absent, while the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of the Self persists. Moreover, if the Self were admitted to be an agent
and an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the idea of 'I,' it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult to avoid the
conclusion that like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> it is non-intelligent, something merely
outward ('being for others only, not for itself') and destitute of
Selfhood. That from the body, which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the idea of 'I,'
and known to be an agent, there is different that Self which enjoys the
results of the body's actions, viz. the heavenly word, and so on, is
acknowledged by all who admit the validity of the instruments of
knowledge; analogously, therefore, we must admit that different from the
knower whom we understand by the term 'I,' is the 'witnessing' inward
Self. The non-intelligent ahamkâra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> merely serves to manifest the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of non-changing consciousness, and it effects this by being its
abode; for it is the proper quality of manifesting agents to manifest
the objects manifested, in so far as the latter abide in them. A mirror,
e.g., or a sheet of water, or a certain mass of matter, manifests a face
or the disc of the moon (reflected in the mirror or water) or the
generic character of a cow (impressed on the mass of matter) in so far
as all those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> abide in them.--In this way, then, there arises the
erroneous <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that finds expression in the judgment 'I know.'--Nor must
you, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of objection, raise the question how self-luminous
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is to be manifested by the non-intelligent ahamkâra, which
rather is itself manifested by consciousness; for we observe that the
surface of the hand, which itself is manifested by the rays of sunlight
falling on it, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> manifests those rays. This is clearly
seen in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of rays passing through the interstices of network; the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of those rays is intensified by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on which they fall, and
which at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is itself manifested by the rays.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears that the 'knowing agent,' who is denoted by the 'I,' in
the judgment 'I know,' constitutes no real attribute of the Self, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of which is pure intelligence. This is also the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why the
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of Egoity does not persist in the states of deep sleep and
final release: in those states this special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> passes
away, and the Self appears in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nature, i.e. as pure
consciousness. Hence a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has risen from deep, dreamless sleep
reflects, 'Just now I was unconscious of myself.'

Summing up of the pûrvapaksha view.

As the outcome of all this, we sum up our <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> as follows.--Eternal,
absolutely non-changing consciousness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pure
non-differenced intelligence, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all distinction whatever, owing
to error illusorily manifests itself (vivarttate) as broken up into
manifold distinctions--knowing subjects, objects of knowledge, acts of
knowledge. And the purpose for which we enter on the consideration of
the Vedânta-texts is utterly to destroy what is the root of that error,
i.e. Nescience, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to obtain a firm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the oneness of
Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is mere intelligence--free, pure, eternal.

particles of the wick and the oil are consumed in succession, we infer
that there are many distinct flames succeeding one another. And we
accept the Inference as valid, and as sublating or refuting the
immediate perception, because the perceived oneness of the flame admits
of being accounted for 'otherwise,' viz. on the ground of the many
distinct flames originating in such rapid succession that the eye
mistakes them for one. The inference on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> does not admit of

possesses this entirely unique originative force, since any action which
may be performed in consequence of a command may be prompted by other
motives as well: it is, in technical Indian language, established
already, apart from the command, by other means of knowledge. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

This entire theory rests on a fictitious foundation of altogether hollow

There is no proof of non-differenced substance.

To enter into details.--Those who maintain the doctrine of a substance
devoid of all difference have no right to assert that this or that is a
proof of such a substance; for all means of right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> have for

stand on the received views of his sect, assert that the theory of a
substance <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all difference (does not require any further means
of proof but) is immediately established by one's own consciousness; we
reply that he also is refuted by the fact, warranted by the witness of
the Self, that all <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> implies difference: all states of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> have for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> something that is marked by some
difference, as appears in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of judgments like 'I saw this.' And
should a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness--although directly apprehended as
implying difference--be determined by some fallacious reasoning to be
devoid of difference, this determination could be effected only by means
of some special attributes additional to the quality of mere Being; and
owing to these special qualities on which the determination depends,
that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> clearly again be characterised by

differences are denied; but manifestly this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not prove the

the knowing principle is observed to have for its essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> the

states of deep sleep, swoon, &c., <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is affected with
difference we shall prove, in its proper place, in greater detail.
Moreover you yourself admit that to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> there actually belong
different attributes such as permanency (oneness, self-luminousness, &c.
), and of these it cannot be shown that they are only Being in general.
And even if the latter point were admitted, we observe that there takes

Sabda proves difference.

As to sound (speech; sabda) it is specially apparent that it possesses
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of denoting only such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as are affected with difference.
Speech operates with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and sentences. Now a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> (pada) originates
from the combination of a radical element and a suffix, and as these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
elements have different meanings it necessarily follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
itself can convey only a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> affected with difference. And further,
the plurality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> is based on plurality of meanings; the sentence

Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves difference.

Perception in the next place--with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> subdivisions of
non-determinate (nirvikalpaka) and determinate (savikalpaka)
perception--also cannot be a means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> devoid of
difference. Determinate perception clearly has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
affected with difference; for it relates to that which is distinguished
by generic difference and so on. But also non-determinate perception has
for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only what is marked with difference; for it is on the
basis of non-determinate perception that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> distinguished by
generic character and so on is recognised in the act of determinate
perception. Non-determinate perception is the apprehension of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
in so far as destitute of some differences but not of all difference.
Apprehension of the latter kind is in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> not observed ever
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, and is in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> impossible: for all
apprehension by <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> by means of some distinction
'This is such and such.' Nothing can be apprehended apart from some
special feature of make or structure, as e.g. the triangularly shaped
dewlap in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of cows. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> distinction between non-determinate
and determinate perception is that the former is the apprehension of the
first individual among a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> belonging to the same class,
while the latter is the apprehension of the second, third, and so on,
individuals. On the apprehension of the first individual cow the
perceiving <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is not conscious of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the special shape
which constitutes the generic character of the class 'cows' extends to
the present individual also; while this special <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> arises in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the perception of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> and <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> cow. The perception
of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is 'determinate' in so far as it is
determined by a special attribute, viz. the extension, to the
perception, of the generic character of a class--manifested in a certain
outward shape--which connects this act of perception with the earlier
perception (of the first individual); such determination being
ascertained only on the apprehension of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> individual. Such
extension or continuance of a certain generic character is, on the other
hand, not apprehended on the apprehension of the first individual, and
perception of the latter kind thence is 'non-determinate.' That it is
such is not due to non-apprehension of structure, colour, generic
character and so on, for all these attributes are equally objects of
sensuous perception (and hence perceived as belonging to the first
individual also). Moreover that which possesses structure cannot be
perceived apart from the structure, and hence in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
apprehension of the first individual there is already perception of
structure, giving rise to the judgment 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is such and such.' In
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the second, third, &c., individuals, on the other hand, we
apprehend, in addition to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> possessing structure and to the
structure itself, the special attribute of the persistence of the
generic character, and hence the perception is 'determinate.' From all
this it follows that perception never has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> that which is
devoid of all difference.




The bhedâbheda <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is untenable.

The same arguments tend to refute the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that there is difference and
absence of difference at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (the so-called bhedâbheda view).
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the judgment 'This is such and such'; how can we realise here the
non-difference of 'being this' and 'being such and such'? The 'such and
such' denotes a peculiar make characterised, e.g. by a dewlap, the
'this' denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished by that peculiar make; the
non-difference of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> contradicted by immediate
consciousness. At the outset the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> perceived is perceived as
separate from all other things, and this separation is founded on the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is distinguished by a special constitution, let us
say the generic characteristics of a cow, expressed by the term 'such
and such.' In general, wherever we cognise the relation of
distinguishing attribute and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished thereby, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
clearly present themselves to our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as absolutely different.
Somethings--e.g. staffs and bracelets--appear sometimes as having a
separate, independent <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of their own; at other times they
present themselves as distinguishing attributes of other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> or
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (i.e. of the persons carrying staffs or wearing bracelets). Other
entities--e.g. the generic character of cows--have a being only in so
far as they constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of substances, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> always present
themselves as distinguishing attributes of those substances. In both
cases there is the same relation of distinguishing attribute and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
distinguished thereby, and these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are apprehended as absolutely
different. The difference between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes of entities is only
that staffs, bracelets, and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are capable of being
apprehended in separation from other things, while the generic
characteristics of a species are absolutely incapable thereof. The
assertion, therefore, that the difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is refuted by
immediate consciousness, is based on the plain denial of a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of consciousness, the one namely--admitted by every one--which is
expressed in the judgment 'This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is such and such.'--This same
point is clearly expounded by the Sûtrakâra in II, 2, 33.




Inference also teaches difference.

Perception <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only what is marked by difference,
inference also is in the same case; for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is only what is
distinguished by connexion with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> known through perception and
other means of knowledge. And thus, even in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of disagreement as
to the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the different instruments of knowledge, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> devoid
of difference could not be established by any of them since the
instruments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acknowledged by all have only one and the same

Perception does not reveal mere being.

In reply to the assertion that perception causes the apprehension of
pure Being only, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> cannot have difference for its object;
and that 'difference' cannot be defined because it does not admit of
being <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in definite alternatives; we point out that these
charges are completely refuted by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the only objects of
perception are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> distinguished by generic character and so on, and
that generic character and so on--as being relative things--give at once
rise to the judgment as to the distinction between themselves and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in which they inhere. You yourself admit that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and in that of colour and other qualities this relation holds
good, viz. that something which gives rise to a judgment about another
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> gives rise to a judgment about itself; the same
may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be admitted with regard to difference [FOOTNOTE 44:1].

For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the charge of a regressus in infinitum and a logical
seesaw (see above, p. 32) cannot be upheld. For even if perceptive
cognition takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> one moment, we apprehend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that moment
the generic character which constitutes on the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the difference
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> from others, and on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the peculiar character
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there remains nothing to be apprehended in
a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> moment.

Moreover, if perception made us apprehend only pure Being judgments
clearly referring to different objects--such as 'Here is a jar,' 'There
is a piece of cloth'--would be devoid of all meaning. And if through
perception we did not apprehend difference--as marked by generic
character, &c., constituting the structure or make of a thing, why
should a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> searching for a horse not be satisfied with finding a
buffalo? And if mere Being only were the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of all our cognitions,
why should we not remember, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of each particular cognition,
all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> which are connected with all our cognitions? And further,
if the cognition of a horse and that of an elephant had one <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only,
the later cognition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cause us to apprehend only what was
apprehended before, and there being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no difference (of <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
cognition) there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be nothing to distinguish the later <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
cognition from remembrance. If on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> a difference is
admitted for each <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness, we admit thereby that
perception has for its objects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> affected with difference.

If all acts of cognition had one and the same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only, everything
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be apprehended by one act of cognition; and from this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
follow that there are no persons either deaf or blind!

Nor does, as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of fact, the eye apprehend mere Being only; for
what it does apprehend is colour and the coloured thing, and those other
qualities (viz. extension, &c.), which inhere in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with
colour. Nor does feeling do so; for it has for its objects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
palpable. Nor have the ear and the other senses mere Being for their
object; but they relate to what is distinguished by a special sound or
taste or smell. Hence there is not any source of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> causing us to
apprehend mere Being. If moreover the senses had for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> mere
Being <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all difference, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that Scripture which has

something, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of which is already established by some other
means. And further, according to your own doctrine, mere Being, i.e.
Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> hold the position of an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> with regard to the
instruments of knowledge; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cling to it all the
imperfections indicated by yourself--non-intelligent nature,
perishableness and so on.--From all this we conclude that perception has
for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only what is distinguished by difference manifesting
itself in generic character and so on, which constitute the make or
structure of a thing. (That the generic character of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is nothing
else but its particular structure follows) from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that we do not
perceive anything, different from structure, which could be claimed as
constituting the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the cognition that several individuals
possess one and the same general form. And as our theory sufficiently
accounts for the ordinary notions as to generic character, and as
moreover even those who hold generic character to be something different
from structure admit that there is such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as (common) structure,
we adhere to the conclusion that generic character is nothing but
structure. By 'structure' we understand special or distinctive form; and
we acknowledge different forms of that kind according to the different
classes of things. And as the current judgments as to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> being
different from one another can be explained on the basis of the
apprehension of generic character, and as no additional entity is
observed to exist, and as even those who maintain the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of such
an additional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> admit the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of generic character, we further
conclude that difference (bheda) is nothing but generic character (jâti).--
But if this were so, the judgment as to difference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> immediately
follow from the judgment as to generic character, as soon as the latter
is apprehended! Quite true, we reply. As a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> the judgment
of difference is immediately formulated on the basis of the judgment as
to generic character. For 'the generic character' of a cow, e.g., means
just the exclusion of everything else: as soon as that character is
apprehended all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech referring to other creatures
belonging to the same wider genus (which includes buffaloes and so on
also) come to an end. It is through the apprehension of difference only
that the idea of non-difference comes to an end.

Plurality is not unreal.

Next as to the assertion that all difference presented in our
cognition--as of jars, pieces of cloth and the like--is unreal because
such difference does not persist. This view, we maintain, is altogether
erroneous, springs in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> from the neglect of distinguishing between
persistence and non-persistence on the one hand, and the relation
between what sublates and what is sublated on the other hand. Where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
cognitions are mutually contradictory, there the latter relation holds
good, and there is non-persistence of what is sublated. But jars, pieces
of cloth and the like, do not contradict one another, since they are
separate in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time. If on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the non-existence of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is cognised at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where and when its
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is cognised, we have a mutual contradiction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cognitions,
and then the stronger one sublates the other cognition which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> comes
to an end. But when of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> that is perceived in connexion with some
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time, the non-existence is perceived in connexion with some
other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time, there arises no contradiction; how then should the
one cognition sublate the other? or how can it be said that of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
absent at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there is absence at other times and places
also? In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the snake-rope, there arises a cognition of
non-existence in connexion with the given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time; hence there is
contradiction, one judgment sublates the other and the sublated
cognition comes to an end. But the circumstance of something which is

another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is not observed to be invariably accompanied by falsehood,
and hence mere non-persistence of this kind does not constitute a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
for unreality. To say, on the other hand, that what is is real because
it persists, is to prove what is proved already, and requires no further
proof.




Being and <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> are not one.

Hence mere Being does not alone constitute reality. And as the
distinction between <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and its objects--which rests just on
this relation of <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> and that for which the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is--is proved by
perception, the assertion that only <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has real <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is
also disposed of.




The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of Svayamprakâsatva.

We next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> up the point as to the self-luminousness of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
(above, p. 33). The contention that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> holds
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for the knowing Self at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when it illumines (i.e.
constitutes as its objects) other things; but there is no absolute rule
as to all <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> never being anything but self-luminous. For
common observation shows that the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> may become
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the cognition of another, viz. of an inference founded on
the person's friendly or unfriendly appearance and the like, and again
that a person's own past states of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> become the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
his own cognition--as appears from judgments such as 'At one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I knew.'
It cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be said 'If it is <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> it is self-proved'
(above p. 33), nor that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> if becoming an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> no longer be consciousness; for from this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
follow that one's own past states, and the conscious states of others--
because being objects of consciousness--are not themselves consciousness.
Moreover, unless it were admitted that there is inferential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> intercourse depending on speech. Nor also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> it be possible
for pupils to attach themselves to a teacher of sacred lore, for the
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that they had become aware of his <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and learning. The
general proposition that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> does not admit of being an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
is in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> quite untenable. The essential 'nature of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or
knowledge--consists therein that it shines forth, or manifests itself,
through its own being to its own substrate at the present moment; or (to
give another definition) that it is instrumental in proving its own
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> by its own being [FOOTNOTE 48:1].

Now these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> characteristics are established by a person's own <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and do not vanish when that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> becomes the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of another <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness; <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> remains also in
the latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> what it is. Jars and similar things, on the other hand,
do not possess consciousness, not because they are objects of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> but because they lack the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> characteristics stated
above. If we made the presence of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> dependent on the absence
of its being an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness, we should arrive at the
conclusion that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not consciousness; for there are
things--e.g. sky-flowers--which are not objects of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> are not consciousness. You will perhaps reply to this that
a sky-flower's not being <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is due not to its not being an
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness, but to its non-existence!--Well then, we
rejoin, let us say analogously that the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of jars and the like not
being contradictory to Nescience (i.e. of their being jada), is their
not being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of consciousness, and let us not have recourse
to their being objects of consciousness!--But if <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is an
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness, we conclude that it also is non-contradictory
of Nescience, like a jar!--At this conclusion, we rejoin, you may arrive
even on the opposite assumption, reasoning as follows: 'Consciousness is
non-contradictory of Nescience, because it is not an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
consciousness, like a sky-flower! All which shows that to maintain as a
general principle that something which is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
cannot itself be <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is simply ridiculous.'

[FOOTNOTE 48:1. The comment of the Sru. Pra. on the above definitions
runs, with a few additional explanations, as follows: The term
'anubhûti' here denotes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in general, not only such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as

not to itself, but to the knowing person). There are other attributes
of the Self, such as atomic extension, eternity, and so on, which are
revealed (not through themselves) but through an act of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is not eternal.

It was further maintained by the pûrvapakshin that as <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
self-established it has no antecedent non-existence and so on, and that
this disproves its having an origin. But this is an attempt to prove
something not proved by something else that is equally unproved;
comparable to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> blind from birth undertaking to guide another blind
man! You have no right to maintain the non-existence of the antecedent
non-existence of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> on the ground that there is nothing to
make us apprehend that non-existence; for there is something to make us
apprehend it, viz. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself!--But how can <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> at
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when it is, make us apprehend its own previous non-existence
which is contradictorily opposed to it?--Consciousness, we rejoin, does
not necessarily constitute as its objects only what occupies the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with itself; were it so it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that neither the past nor
the future can be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness. Or do you mean that there
is an absolute rule that the Antecedent non-existence of consciousness,
if proved, must be contemporaneous with consciousness? Have you then, we
ask, ever observed this so as to be able to assert an absolute rule? And
if it were observed, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prove the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of previous
non-existence, not its negation!--The fact, however, is that no <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
in his senses will maintain the contemporaneous <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and its own antecedent non-existence. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
perceptive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> originating from sensation, there is indeed this
limitation, that it causes the apprehension of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only as are
actually present at the same time. But this limitation does not extend
to cognitions of all kinds, nor to all instruments of knowledge; for we
observe that remembrance, inference, and the magical perception of Yogis
apprehend such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> also as are not present at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
apprehension. On this very point there rests the relation connecting the
means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with their objects, viz. that the former are not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the latter. This does not mean that the instrument of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
is connected with its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
something that is present at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of cognition; but rather that the
instrument of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is opposed to the falsehood of that special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
in which the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> presents itself as connected with some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and
time.--This disposes also of the contention that remembrance has no
external object; for it is observed that remembrance is related to such
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> also as have perished.--Possibly you will now argue as follows.
The antecedent non-existence of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be ascertained by
perception, for it is not something present at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of perception.
It further cannot be ascertained by the other means of knowledge, since
there is no characteristic mark (linga) on which an inference could be
based: for we do not observe any characteristic mark invariably
accompanied by the antecedent non-existence of consciousness. Nor do we
meet with any scriptural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> referring to this antecedent
non-existence. Hence, in the absence of any valid instrument of
knowledge, the antecedent non-existence of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be
established at all.--If, we reply, you thus, altogether setting aside
the force of self-provedness (on which you had relied hitherto), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
your stand on the absence of valid means of knowledge, we again must
request you to give in; for there is a valid means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> whereby
to prove the antecedent non-existence of consciousness, viz. valid
non-perception (anupalabdhi).

Moreover, we observe that perceptional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> proves its object, be
it a jar or something else, to exist only as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as it exists itself,
not at all times; we do not, through it, apprehend the antecedent or
subsequent <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the jar. Now this absence of apprehension is due
to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself is limited in time. If that
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which has a jar for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> were itself apprehended as
non-limited in time, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> also--the jar--would be apprehended
under the same form, i.e. it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be eternal. And if self-established
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> were eternal, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be immediately cognised as eternal;
but this is not the case. Analogously, if inferential <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and
other forms of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> were apprehended as non-limited in time,
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> all of them reveal their objects also as non-limited, and
these objects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be eternal; for the objects are conform in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to their respective forms of consciousness.




There is no <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> object.

Nor is there any <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> devoid of objects; for nothing of this
kind is ever known. Moreover, the self-luminousness of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> has,
by our opponent himself, been proved on the ground that its essential
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> consists in illumining (revealing) objects; the self-luminousness
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> not admitting of proof apart from its essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
which consists in the lighting up of objects. And as moreover, according
to our opponent, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of another
consciousness, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that (having neither an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> nor itself
being an object) it is something altogether unreal, imaginary.

Nor are you justified in maintaining that in deep sleep, swoon,
senselessness and similar states, pure consciousness, devoid of any
object, manifests itself. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is negatived by 'valid
non-perception' (see above, p. 52). If <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> were present in
those states also, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be remembrance of it at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
waking from sleep or recovery from swoon; but as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> there
is no such remembrance.--But it is not an absolute rule that something
of which we were conscious must be remembered; how then can the absence
of remembrance prove the absence of previous consciousness?--Unless, we
reply, there be some cause of overpowering strength which quite
obliterates all impressions--as e.g. the dissolution of the body--the
absence of remembrance does necessarily prove the absence of previous
consciousness. And, moreover, in the present <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the absence of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> does not only follow from absence of remembrance; it is
also proved by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> presenting itself to the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> risen from
sleep, 'For so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I was not conscious of anything.'--Nor may it
be said that even if there was consciousness, absence of remembrance
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> necessarily follow from the absence (during deep sleep) of the
distinction of objects, and from the extinction of the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
the 'I'; for the non-consciousness of some one thing, and the absence of
some one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> cannot be the cause of the non-remembrance of some other
thing, of which there had been consciousness. And that in the states in
question the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I' does persist, will moreover be
shown further on.

But, our opponent urges, have you not said yourself that even in deep
sleep and similar states there is <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> marked by difference?--
True, we have said so. But that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the
Self, and that this is affected by difference will be proved further on.
At present we are only interested in denying the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of your pure
consciousness, devoid of all objects and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a substrate. Nor can we
admit that your pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> could constitute what we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Self; for we shall prove that the latter has a
substrate.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> cannot be maintained that the antecedent non-existence of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> does not admit of being proved, because <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
itself does not prove it. And as we have shown that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself
may be an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness, we have thereby disproved the alleged
impossibility of antecedent non-existence being proved by other means.
Herewith falls the assertion that the non-origination of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
can be proved.




<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is capable of change.

Against the assertion that the alleged non-origination of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> proves that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not capable of any other
changes (p. 36), we remark that the general proposition on which this
conclusion rests is too wide: it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> extend to antecedent
non-existence itself, of which it is evident that it comes to an end,
although it does not originate. In qualifying the changes as changes of
'Being,' you manifest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> logical acumen indeed! For according to your
own <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> Nescience also (which is not 'Being') does not originate, is
the substrate of manifold changes, and comes to an end through the rise
of knowledge! Perhaps you will say that the changes of Nescience are all
unreal. But, do you then, we ask in reply, admit that any change is
real? You do not; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is only this admission which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> give a
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> to the distinction expressed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Being' [FOOTNOTE 54:1].

Nor is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> does not admit of any division <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
itself, because it has no beginning (p. 36). For the non-originated Self
is divided from the body, the senses, &c., and Nescience also, which is
avowedly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a beginning, must needs be admitted to be divided from
the Self. And if you say that the latter division is unreal, we ask
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> you have ever observed a real division invariably connected with
origination! Moreover, if the distinction of Nescience from the Self is
not real, it follows that Nescience and the Self are essentially one.
You further have yourself proved the difference of views by means of the
difference of the objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as established by non-refuted
knowledge; an analogous <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> being furnished by the difference of acts
of cleaving, which results from the difference of objects to be cleft.
And if you assert that of this knowing--which is essentially knowing
only--nothing that is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can be an attribute, and
that these objects--just because they are objects of knowledge--cannot
be attributes of knowing; we point out that both these remarks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
apply also to eternity, self-luminousness, and the other attributes of
'knowing', which are acknowledged by yourself, and established by valid
means of proof. Nor may you urge against this that all these alleged
attributes are in reality mere 'consciousness' or 'knowing'; for they
are essentially distinct. By 'being conscious' or 'knowing', we
understand the illumining or manifesting of some <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to its own
substrate (i.e. the substrate of knowledge), by its own <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (i.e.
the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of knowledge) merely; by self-luminousness (or
'self-illuminatedness') we understand the shining forth or being
manifest by its own <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> merely to its own substrate; the terms
'shining forth', 'illumining', 'being manifest' in both these
definitions <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> the capability of becoming an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
speech which is common to all things, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> intelligent or
non-intelligent. Eternity again means 'being present in all time';
oneness means 'being defined by the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> one'. Even if you say that
these attributes are only negative ones, i.e. equal to the absence of
non-intelligence and so on, you still cannot avoid the admission that
they are attributes of consciousness. If, on the other hand, being of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> opposite to non-intelligence and so on, be not admitted as
attributes of consciousness--whether of a positive or a negative
kind--in addition to its essential nature; it is an altogether unmeaning
proceeding to deny to it such qualities, as non-intelligence and the
like.

We moreover must admit the following alternative: <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
either proved (established) or not. If it is proved it follows that it
possesses attributes; if it is not, it is something absolutely nugatory,
like a sky-flower, and similar purely imaginary things.

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self.

Let it then be said that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is proof (siddhih) itself. Proof
of what, we ask in reply, and to whom? If no definite answer can be
given to these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> questions, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be defined as
'proof'; for 'proof' is a relative notion, like 'son.' You will perhaps
reply 'Proof to the Self'; and if we go on asking 'But what is that
Self'? you will say, 'Just <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> as already said by us before.'
True, we reply, you said so; but it certainly was not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> said. For if
it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> to be 'proof' ('light,'
'enlightenment') on the part of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> with regard to something, how
can this <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> connected with the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> be itself conscious of itself? To explain: the essential character
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is that by its very <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> it renders
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> capable of becoming objects, to its own substrate, of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
speech. This <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> (anubhûti), which is also termed jñâna,
avagati, samvid, is a particular attribute belonging to a conscious Self
and related to an object: as such it is known to every one on the
testimony of his own Self--as appears from ordinary judgments such as 'I
know the jar,' 'I understand this matter,' 'I am conscious of (the
presence of) this piece of cloth.' That such is the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> you yourself admit; for you have proved thereby its
self-luminousness. Of this <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> clearly presents
itself as the attribute of an agent and as related to an object, it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult indeed to prove that at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is itself
the agent; as difficult as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be to prove that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
action is the agent.

For we clearly see that this agent (the subject of consciousness) is
permanent (constant), while its attribute, i. e. consciousness, not
differing herein from joy, grief, and the like, rises, persists for some
time, and then comes to an end. The permanency of the conscious subject
is proved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of recognition, 'This very same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> was formerly
apprehended by me.' The non-permanency of consciousness, on the other
hand, is proved by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> expressing itself in the following forms, 'I
know at present,' 'I knew at a time,' 'I, the knowing subject, no longer
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this thing.' How then should <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and (the
conscious subject) be one? If <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which changes every moment
were admitted to constitute the conscious subject, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
impossible for us to recognise the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> seen to-day as the one we saw
yesterday; for what has been perceived by one cannot be recognised by
another. And even if <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> were identified with the conscious
subject and acknowledged as permanent, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> no better <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of recognition. For recognition implies a conscious subject
persisting from the earlier to the later moment, and not merely
consciousness. Its expression is 'I myself perceived this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> on a
former occasion.' According to your <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the quality of being a
conscious agent cannot at all belong to consciousness; for consciousness,
you say, is just <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and nothing more. And that there exists a
pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> devoid of substrate and objects alike, we have
already refuted on the ground that of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> of this kind we have
absolutely no knowledge. And that the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> admitted by both of
us should be the Self is refuted by immediate <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself. And
we have also refuted the fallacious arguments <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forward to prove
that mere <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is the only reality.--But, another objection is
raised, should the relation of the Self and the 'I' not rather be
conceived as follows:--In self-consciousness which expresses itself in
the judgment 'I know,' that intelligent something which constitutes the
absolutely non-objective element, and is pure homogeneous light, is the
Self; the objective element (yushmad-artha) on the other hand, which is
established through its being illumined (revealed) by the Self is the
_I_--in 'I know'--and this is something different from pure
intelligence, something objective or external?

By no means, we reply; for this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> contradicts the relation of
attribute and substrate of attribute of which we are directly conscious,
as implied in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> 'I know.'

Consider also what follows.--'If the _I_ were not the Self, the
inwardness of the Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not exist; for it is just the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of the _I_ which separates the inward from the outward.

'"May I, freeing myself from all pain, enter on <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> possession of
endless delight?" This is the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> which prompts the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> desirous of
release to apply himself to the study of the sacred texts. Were it a
settled <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that release consists in the annihilation of the I, the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> move away as soon as release were only hinted at. "When I
myself have perished, there still persists some <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> different
from me;" to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> this about nobody truly will exert himself.

'Moreover the very <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of consciousness, its being a <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
at all, and its being self-luminous, depend on its connexion with a Self;
when that connexion is dissolved, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself cannot be
established, not any more than the act of cutting can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when
there is no <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to cut and nothing to be cut. Hence it is certain
that the I, i.e. the knowing subject, is the inward Self.'

This scripture confirms when saying 'By what should he know the knower?'
(Bri. Up. II, 4, 15); and Smriti also, 'Him who knows this they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the
knower of the body' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 1). And the Sûtrakâra also, in the
section beginning with 'Not the Self on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement'
(II, 3, 17), will say 'For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (it is) a knower' (II, 3,
18); and from this it follows that the Self is not mere consciousness.

What is established by <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I' is the I itself, while
the not-I is given in the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the not-I; hence to say that
the knowing subject, which is established by the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness,
'I know,' is the not-I, is no better than to maintain that one's own
mother is a barren woman. Nor can it be said that this 'I,' the knowing
subject, is dependent on its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> for something else. It rather is
self-luminous; for to be self-luminous means to have <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> for
one's essential nature. And that which has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> for its essential
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> does not depend for its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on something else. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is
analogous to that of the flame of a lamp or candle. From the
circumstance that the lamp illumines with its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> other things, it
does not follow either that it is not luminous, or that its luminousness
depends on something else; the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> rather is that the lamp being of
luminous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> shines itself and illumines with its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
also. To explain.--The one substance tejas, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> or heat, subsists
in a double form, viz. as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (prabhâ), and as luminous matter.
Although <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is a quality of luminous substantial things, it is in
itself nothing but the substance tejas, not a mere quality like e.g.
whiteness; for it exists also apart from its substrates, and possesses
colour (which is a quality). Having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attributes different from those
of qualities such as whiteness and so on, and possessing illumining
power, it is the substance tejas, not anything else (e.g. a quality).
Illumining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> belongs to it, because it lights up itself and other
things. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is practically treated as a quality because
it always has the substance tejas for its substrate, and depends on it.
This must not be objected to on the ground that what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is
really nothing but dissolving particles of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> which proceed from the
substance tejas; for if this were so, shining gems and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in
the end consume themselves completely. Moreover, if the flame of a lamp
consisted of dissolving particles of matter, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never be
apprehended as a whole; for no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> can be stated why those particles
should regularly rise in an agglomerated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> to the height of four
fingers breadth, and after that simultaneously disperse themselves
uniformly in all directions--upwards, sideways, and downwards. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
is that the flame of the lamp <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is produced anew
every moment and again vanishes every moment; as we may infer from the
successive combination of sufficient causes (viz. particles of oil and
wick) and from its coming to an end when those causes are completely
consumed.

Analogously to the lamp, the Self is essentially intelligent (kid-rûpa),
and has <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> (kaitanya) for its quality. And to be essentially
intelligent means to be self-luminous. There are many scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
declaring this, compare e.g. 'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor
outside but is altogether a mass of taste, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> indeed that Self has
neither inside nor outside but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (Bri.
Up. IV, 5, 13); 'There that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> becomes self-luminous, there is no
destruction of the knowing of the knower' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 14; 30); 'He
who knows, let me smell this, he is the Self (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 4); 'Who
is that Self? That one who is made of knowledge, among the prânas,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, the light, the person' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 7); 'For it is
he who sees, hears, smells, tastes, thinks, considers, acts, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>

knower' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15). 'This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> knows,' 'The seer does not
see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> nor illness nor pain' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2); 'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

12, 3); 'Thus these sixteen parts of the spectator that go towards the
person; when they have readied the person, sink into him' (Pr. Up. VI,
5); 'From this consisting of mind, there is different an interior Self
consisting of knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 4). And the Sûtrakâra also will
refer to the Self as a 'knower' in II, 3, 18. All which shows that the
self-luminous Self is a knower, i.e. a knowing subject, and not pure
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (non-personal intelligence). In general we may say that where
there is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> it must belong to something, as shown by the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a
lamp. The Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> cannot be mere consciousness. The grammarians
moreover tell us that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as 'consciousness,' 'knowledge,' &c.,
are relative; neither ordinary nor Vedic language uses expressions such
as 'he knows' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reference to an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> known and an agent who
knows.

With reference to the assertion that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> constitutes the Self,
because it (consciousness) is not non-intelligent (jada), we ask what
you understand by this absence of non-intelligence.' If you reply
'luminousness due to the being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself (i.e. of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
which is ajada)'; we point out that this definition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> wrongly
include lamps also, and similar things; and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> moreover give rise
to a contradiction, since you do not admit <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> as an attribute,
different from <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> itself. Nor can we allow you to define
ajadatva as 'being of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is always present, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

and similar states. Should you maintain that pleasure and so on,
although being throughout of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of light, are non-intelligent
for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that, like jars, &c., they shine forth (appear) to
something else and hence belong to the sphere of the not-Self; we ask in
reply: Do you mean then to say that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> appears to itself?
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> no less than pleasure appears to some one else, viz. the 'I':
there is, in that respect, no difference between the judgment 'I know,'
and the judgment 'I am pleased.' Non-intelligence in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
appearingness-to-itself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not proved for consciousness; and hence
it follows that what constitutes the Self is the non-jada 'I' which is
proved to itself by its very Being. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> depends altogether on its connection with the knowing 'I': it is
due to the latter, that knowledge, like pleasure, manifests itself to
that conscious <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who is its substrate, and not to anybody else. The
Self is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not mere knowledge, but is the knowing 'I.'




The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the
ahamkâra, cannot be maintained.

We turn to a further point. You maintain that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which is in
reality devoid alike of objects and substrate presents itself, owing to
error, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a knowing subject, just as mother o' pearl appears
as silver; (consciousness itself being viewed as a real substrate of an
erroneous imputation), because an erroneous imputation cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
apart from a substrate. But this theory is indefensible. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> were
as you describe them, the conscious 'I' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be cognised as co-ordinate
with the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> 'I am consciousness,' just as the
shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> presenting itself to our <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> is judged to be silver. But
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> presents itself as something
apart, constituting a distinguishing attribute of the I, just as the
stick is an attribute of Devadatta who carries it. The judgment 'I am
conscious' reveals an 'I' distinguished by consciousness; and to declare
that it refers only to a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness--which is a mere
attribute--is no better than to say that the judgment 'Devadatta carries
a stick' is about the stick only. Nor are you right in saying that the
idea of the Self being a knowing agent, presents itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of
him only who erroneously identifies the Self and the body, an error
expressing itself in judgments such as 'I am stout,' and is on that
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> false; for from this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
which is erroneously imagined as a Self is also false; for it presents
itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the same person. You will perhaps rejoin that
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is not false because it (alone) is not sublatcd by that
cognition which sublates everything else. Well, we reply, then the
knowership of the Self also is not false; for that also is not sublatcd.
You further maintain that the character of being a knower, i.e. the
agent in the action of knowing, does not become the non-changing Self;
that being a knower is something implying change, of a non-intelligent
kind (jada), and residing in the ahamkâra which is the abode of change
and a mere effect of the Unevolved (the Prakriti); that being an agent
and so on is like colour and other qualities, an attribute of what is
objective; and that if we admit the Self to be an agent and the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of the notion of the 'I,' it also follows that the Self is, like the
body, not a real Self but something external and non-intelligent. But
all this is unfounded, since the internal organ is, like the body,
non-intelligent, an effect of Prakriti, an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge,
something outward and for the sake of others merely; while being a
knowing subject constitutes the special essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of intelligent
beings. To explain. Just as the body, through its objectiveness,
outwardness, and similar causes, is distinguished from what possesses
the opposite attributes of subjectiveness, inwardness, and so on; for
the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the ahamkâra also--which is of the same substantial
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the body--is similarly distinguished. Hence the ahamkâra is
no more a knower than it is something subjective; otherwise there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be an evident contradiction. As knowing cannot be attributed to the
ahamkâra, which is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, so knowership also cannot be
ascribed to it; for of that also it is the object. Nor can it be
maintained that to be a knower is something essentially changing. For to
be a knower is to be the substrate of the quality of knowledge, and as
the knowing Self is eternal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is an essential quality of
the Self is also eternal. That the Self is <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> will be declared in
the Sûtra, II, 3, 17; and in II, 3, 18 the term 'jña' (knower) will show
that it is an essential quality of the Self to be the abode of
knowledge. That a Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> should be the
substrate of the (quality of) knowledge--just as gems and the like are
the substrate of light--gives rise to no contradiction whatever.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> (the quality) which is in itself unlimited, is capable of
contraction and expansion, as we shall show later on. In the so-called
kshetrajña--condition of the Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is, owing to the influence
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (karman), of a contracted nature, as it more or less adapts
itself to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of different kinds, and is variously determined by the
different senses. With reference to this various flow of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as
due to the senses, it is spoken of as rising and setting, and the Self
possesses the quality of an agent. As this quality is not, however,
essential, but originated by action, the Self is essentially unchanging.
This changeful quality of being a knower can belong only to the Self
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is knowledge; not possibly to the non-intelligent
ahamkâra. But, you will perhaps say, the ahamkâra, although of non-
intelligent nature, may become a knower in so far as by approximation to
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> it becomes a reflection of the latter. How, we ask in
return, is this becoming a reflection of <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> imagined to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
place? Does <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> become a reflection of the ahamkâra, or does
the ahamkâra become a reflection of consciousness? The former
alternative is inadmissible, since you will not allow to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
the quality of being a knower; and so is the latter since, as explained
above, the non-intelligent ahamkâra can never become a knower. Moreover,
neither <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> nor the ahamkâra are objects of visual perception.
Only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen by the eye have reflections.--Let it then be said that
as an iron ball is heated by contact with fire, so the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
being a knower is imparted to the ahamkâra through its contact with
Intelligence.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> too is inadmissible; for as you do not allow
real knowership to Intelligence, knowership or the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
knowership cannot be imparted to the ahamkâra by contact with
Intelligence; and much less even can knowership or the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
it be imparted to <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">Intelligence</span> by contact with the essentially non-
intelligent ahamkâra. Nor can we accept what you say about
'manifestation.' Neither the ahamkâra, you say, nor <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">Intelligence</span> is
really a knowing subject, but the ahamkâra manifests <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself (within the ahamkâra), as the mirror manifests the
image abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it. But the essentially non-intelligent ahamkâra
evidently cannot 'manifest' the self-luminous Self. As has been said
'That the non-intelligent ahamkâra should manifest the self-luminous
Self, has no more <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> than to say that a spent coal manifests the Sun.'
The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> depend for their proof on self-luminous
consciousness; and now you maintain that one of these things, viz. the
non-intelligent ahamkâra--which itself depends for its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on
consciousness--manifests consciousness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> never
rises or sets, and which is the cause that proves everything! Whoever
knows the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self will justly deride such a view! The
relation of 'manifestation' cannot hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> between <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and
the ahamkâra for the further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also that there is a contradiction
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between the two, and because it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> not
to be consciousness. As has been said, 'One cannot manifest the other,
owing to contradictoriness; and if the Self were something to be
manifested, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply its being non-intelligent like a jar.' Nor
is the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> improved by your introducing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and the sunbeams
(above, p. 38), and to say that as the sunbeams while manifesting the
hand, are at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> manifested by the hand, so consciousness,
while manifesting the ahamkâra, is at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> itself manifested by
the latter. The sunbeams are in reality not manifested by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> at
all. What takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is that the motion of the sunbeams is reversed
(reflected) by the opposed hand; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> become more numerous, and
hence are perceived more clearly; but this is due altogether to the
multitude of beams, not to any manifesting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> on the part of the hand.

What could, moreover, be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that 'manifestation' of the Self
consisting of Intelligence, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be effected through the ahamkâra?
It cannot be origination; for you acknowledge that what is self-
established cannot be originated by anything else. Nor can it be
'illumination' (making to shine forth), since <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot--
according to you--be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of another consciousness. For the same
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it cannot be any action assisting the means of being conscious of
consciousness. For such helpful action could be of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds only. It
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> either be such as to cause the connexion of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be known
with the sense-organs; as e.g. any action which, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
apprehension of a species or of one's own face, causes connexion between
the organ of sight and an individual of the species, or a looking-glass.
Or it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be such as to remove some obstructive impurity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
of the knowing person; of this kind is the action of calmness and self-
restraint with reference to scripture which is the means of apprehending
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> reality. Moreover, even if it were admitted that
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> may be an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness, it could not be
maintained that the 'I' assists the means whereby that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
effected. For if it did so, it could only be in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of removing any
obstacles impeding the origination of such consciousness; analogous to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which a lamp assists the eye by dispelling the darkness which
impedes the origination of the apprehension of colour. But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
under discussion we are unable to imagine such obstacles. There is
nothing pertaining to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which obstructs the origination of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and which could be removed by the
ahamkâra.--There is something, you will perhaps reply, viz. Nescience!
Not so, we reply. That Nescience is removed by the ahamkâra cannot be
admitted; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone can put an end to Nescience. Nor can
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> be the abode of Nescience, because in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> Nescience
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have the same abode and the same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> as knowledge.

In pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> where there is no knowing subject and no <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
knowledge--the so-called 'witnessing' principle (sâkshin)--Nescience
cannot exist. Jars and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> cannot be the abode of Nescience
because there is no possibility of their being the abode of knowledge,
and for the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> also cannot be the abode of
Nescience. And even if <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> were admitted to be the abode of
Nescience, it could not be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; for <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
being viewed as the Self cannot be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, and hence
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> cannot terminate the Nescience abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> consciousness.
For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> puts an end to Nescience only with regard to its own
objects, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the snake-rope. And the consequence of this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that the Nescience attached to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> could never be
destroyed by any one.--If Nescience, we further remark, is viewed as
that which can be defined neither as Being nor non-Being, we shall show
later on that such Nescience is something quite incomprehensible.--On
the other hand, Nescience, if understood to be the antecedent non-
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of knowledge, is not opposed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to the origination of
knowledge, and hence the dispelling of Nescience cannot be viewed as
promoting the means of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Self.--From all this it
follows that the ahamkâra cannot effect in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> 'manifestation of
consciousness.'

Nor (to finish up this point) can it be said that it is the essential
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of manifesting agents to manifest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in so far as the latter
have their abode in the former; for such a relation is not observed in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of lamps and the like (which manifest what lies outside them).
The essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of manifesting agents rather lies therein that they
promote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as they really are, and this is also the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of whatever promotes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and the means thereof. Nor is it
even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the mirror manifests the face. The mirror is only the
cause of a certain irregularity, viz. the reversion of the ocular rays
of light, and to this irregularity there is due the appearance of the
face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the mirror; but the manifesting agent is the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> only. And
it is evident that the ahamkâra is not capable of producing an
irregularity (analogous to that produced by the mirror) in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
which is self-luminous.--And--with regard to the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> analogous
instance alleged by you--the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the species is known through
the individual because the latter is its substrate (as expressed in the
general principle, 'the species is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the individual'), but not
because the individual 'manifests' the species. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> there is no reason,
either real or springing from some imperfection, why the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> should be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by its abiding in the ahamkâra,
and the attribute of being the knowing agent or the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
that cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> belong to the ahamkâra. Hence, what constitutes
the inward Self is not pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> but the 'I' which proves
itself as the knowing subject. In the absence of egoity, 'inwardness'
could not be established for consciousness.




The conscious subject persists in deep sleep.

We now come to the question as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of deep sleep. In deep
sleep the quality of darkness prevails in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and there is no
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of outward things, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there is no distinct and clear
presentation of the 'I'; but all the same the Self somehow presents
itself up to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of waking in the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the 'I,' and the
latter cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be said to be absent. Pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> assumed
by you (to manifest itself in deep sleep) is really in no better case;
for a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> risen from deep sleep never represents to himself his
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> during sleep in the form, 'I was pure
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all egoity and opposed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to everything
else, witnessing Nescience'; what he thinks is only 'I slept well.' From
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of reflection it appears that even during sleep the Self. i.e.
the 'I,' was a knowing subject and perceptive of pleasure. Nor must you
urge against this that the reflection has the following form: 'As now I
feel pleasure, so I slept then also'; for the reflection is distinctly
_not_ of that kind. [FOOTNOTE 68:1] Nor must you say that owing to the
non-permanency of the 'I' its perception of pleasure during sleep
cannot connect itself with the waking state. For (the 'I' is permanent
as appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that) the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has risen from sleep
recalls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of which he was conscious before his sleep, 'I did such
and such a thing,' 'I observed this or that,' 'I said so or so.'--But,
you will perhaps say, he also reflects, 'For such and such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I was
conscious of nothing!'--'And what does this imply?' we ask.--'It implies
a negation of everything!'--By no means, we rejoin. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'I was
conscious' show that the knowing 'I' persisted, and that hence what is
negated is only the objects of knowledge. If the negation implied in 'of
nothing' included everything, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also negative the pure
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which you hold to persist in deep sleep. In the judgment
'I was conscious of nothing,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'I' clearly refers to the 'I,' i.
e. the knowing Self which persists even during deep sleep, while the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'was conscious of nothing' negative all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on the part of
that 'I'; if, now, in the face of this, you undertake to prove by means
of this very judgment that knowledge--which is expressly denied--existed
at the time, and that the persisting knowing Self did not exist, you may
address your proof to the patient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> who give no reply!--But--our
opponent goes on to urge--I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the following judgment also: 'I then
was not conscious of myself,' and from this I understand that the 'I'
did not persist during deep sleep!--You do not know, we rejoin, that
this denial of the persistence of the 'I' flatly contradicts the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> expressed in the judgment 'I was not conscious of
myself' and the verbal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the judgment itself!--But what then is
denied by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'of myself?--This, we admit, is a reasonable
question. Let us consider the point. What is negatived in that judgment
is not the knowing 'I' itself, but merely the distinctions of caste,
condition of life, &c. which belong to the 'I' at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of waking. We
must distinguish the objects of the several parts of the judgment under
discussion. The <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the '(me) myself' is the 'I' distinguished by
class characteristics as it presents itself in the waking state; the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'I' (in the judgment) is that 'I' which consists of a
uniform flow of self-consciousness which persists in sleep also, but is
then not quite distinct. The judgment 'I did not know myself' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
means that the sleeper was not conscious of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where he slept, of
his special characteristics, and so on.--It is, moreover, your own <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
that in deep sleep the Self occupies the position of a witnessing
principle with regard to Nescience. But by a witness (sâkshin) we
understand some one who knows about something by personal observation
(sâkshât); a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who does not know cannot be a witness. Accordingly,
in scripture as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in ordinary language a knowing subject only, not
mere knowledge, is spoken of as a witness; and with this the Reverend
Pânini also agrees when teaching that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'sâkshin' means one who
knows in <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (Pâ. Sû. V, 2, 91). Now this witness is nothing else but
the 'I' which is apprehended in the judgment 'I know'; and how then
should this 'I' not be apprehended in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of sleep? That which
itself appears to the Self appears as the 'I,' and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> follows that
also in deep sleep and similar states the Self which then shines forth
appears as the 'I.'

[FOOTNOTE 68:1. I. e. the reflection as to the perception of pleasure
refers to the past <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of sleep only, not to the present moment of
reflection.]




The conscious subject persists in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of release.

To maintain that the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I' does not persist in the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of final release is again altogether inappropriate. It in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
amounts to the doctrine--only expressed in somewhat different words--
that final release is the annihilation of the Self. The 'I' is not a
mere attribute of the Self so that even after its destruction the
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self might persist--as it persists on the
cessation of ignorance; but it constitutes the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self.
Such judgments as 'I know', 'Knowledge has arisen in me', show, on the
other hand, that we are conscious of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as a mere attribute of
the Self.--Moreover, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who suffering pain, mental or of other kind--
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> such pain be real or due to error only--puts himself in relation
to pain--'I am suffering pain'--naturally begins to reflect how he may
once for all <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> himself from all these manifold afflictions and enjoy
a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of untroubled ease; the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of final release <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having
arisen in him he at once sets to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to accomplish it. If, on the other
hand, he were to realise that the effect of such activity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the
loss of personal existence, he surely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> turn away as soon as
somebody began to tell him about 'release'. And the result of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be that, in the absence of willing and qualified pupils, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
scriptural teaching as to final release <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lose its authoritative
character.--Nor must you maintain against this that even in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
release there persists pure consciousness; for this by no means improves
your case. No sensible <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> exerts himself under the influence of the
idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity
termed 'pure light!'--What constitutes the 'inward' Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is the 'I',
the knowing subject.

This 'inward' Self shines forth in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of final release also as an
'I'; for it appears to itself. The general principle is that whatever
being appears to itself appears as an 'I'; both parties in the present
dispute establish the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the transmigrating Self on such
appearance. On the contrary, whatever does not appear as an 'I', does
not appear to itself; as jars and the like. Now the emancipated Self
does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appear to itself, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it appears as an 'I'. Nor does
this appearance as an 'I' imply in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the released Self is
subject to Nescience and implicated in the Samsâra; for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
contradict the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of final release, and moreover the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of the 'I' cannot be the cause of Nescience and so on. Nescience
(ignorance) is either ignorance as to essential nature, or the cognition
of something under an aspect different from the real one (as when a
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> suffering from jaundice sees all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> yellow); or cognition of
what is altogether opposite in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (as when mother o' pearl is
mistaken for silver). Now the 'I' constitutes the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the Self; how then can the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I,' i.e. the
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nature, implicate the released Self in
Nescience, or, in the Samsâra? The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> rather is that such
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> destroys Nescience, and so on, because it is essentially
opposed to them. In agreement with this we observe that persons like the
rishi Vâmadeva, in whom the intuition of their identity with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> had
totally destroyed all Nescience, enjoyed the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the
personal 'I'; for scripture says, 'Seeing this the rishi Vâmadeva
understood,_I_ was Manu and the Sun' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 10). And the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also, which is opposed to all other forms of Nescience
and denoted and conceived as pure Being, is spoken of in an analogous
way; cp. 'Let me make each of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> deities,' &c. (Ch. Up. VI, 3,
3); 'May I be many, may I grow forth' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3); 'He thought,
shall I send forth worlds?' (Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 1); and again, 'Since I
transcend the Destructible, and am <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> also than the Indestructible,

information about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self it is spoken of as the 'I',
we conclude that the 'I' constitutes the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the inward
Self. Where, on the other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> One declares the ahamkâra--a
special effect of the Unevolved--to be comprised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere of
the Objective, he means that principle which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ahamkâra, because
it causes the assumption of Egoity on the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which belongs
to the Not-self. Such egoity constitutes the ahamkâra also designated as
pride or arrogance, which causes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to slight persons superior to
themselves, and is referred to by scripture in many places as something
evil. Such <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> as is not sublated by

such <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the 'I' as has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is mere
Nescience. In agreement with this the Reverend Parâsara has said, 'Hear
from me the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Nescience; it is the attribution of
Selfhood to what is not the Self.' If the Self were pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
then pure <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only, and not the quality of being a knowing
subject, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> present itself in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> also, which is a Not-self
wrongly imagined to be a Self. The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> remains that the
Self is nothing but the knowing 'I'. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it has been said, 'As is
proved by perception, and as also results from reasoning and tradition,
and from its connexion with ignorance, the Self presents itself as a
knowing 'I'. And again,'That which is different from body, senses, mind,
and vital airs; which does not depend on other means; which is permanent,
pervading, divided according to bodies-that is the Self <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> in
itself.' Here 'not dependent on other means' means 'self-luminous'; and
'pervading' means 'being of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as to enter, owing to
excessive minuteness, into all non-sentient things.'




In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not
stronger. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> cannot be known through the Untrue.

With reference to the assertion (p. 24 ff.) that Perception, which
depends on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality, is based on some defect and hence
admits of being otherwise accounted for--whence it follows that it is
sublated by Scripture; we ask you to point out what defect it is on
which Perception is based and may hence be accounted for otherwise.--'
The beginningless imagination of difference' we expect you to reply.--
But, we ask in return, have you then come to know by some other means
that this beginningless imagination of difference, acting in a manner
analogous to that of certain defects of vision, is really the cause of
an altogether perverse <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of things?--If you reply that this is known
just from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that Perception is in conflict with Scripture, we
point out that you are reasoning in a circle: you prove the
defectiveness of the imagination of plurality through the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that
Scripture tells us about a substance devoid of all difference; and at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> you prove the latter point through the former. Moreover,
if Perception gives rise to perverse cognition because it is based on
the imagination of plurality, Scripture also is in no better case--for
it is based on the very same view.--If against this you urge that
Scripture, although based on a defect, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> sublates Perception in so far
as it is the cause of a cognition which dispels all plurality
apprehended through Perception, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is later in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> than
Perception; we rejoin that the defectiveness of the foundation of
Scripture having once been recognised, the circumstance of its being
later is of no avail. For if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is afraid of a rope which he mistakes
for a snake his <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> does not come to an end because another man, whom
he considers to be in error himself, tells him 'This is no snake, do not
be afraid.' And that Scripture _is_ founded on something defective is
known at the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of hearing Scripture, for the reflection (which
follows on hearing) consists in repeated attempts to cognise the oneness
of Brahman--a cognition which is destructive of all the plurality
apprehended through the first hearing of the Veda.--We further ask, 'By
what means do you arrive at the conclusion that Scripture cannot
possibly be assumed to be defective in any way, while defects may be
ascribed to Perception'? It is certainly not Consciousness--self-proved
and absolutely devoid of all difference--which enlightens you on this
point; for such <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is unrelated to any objects whatever, and
incapable of partiality to Scripture. Nor can sense-perception be the
source of your conviction; for as it is founded on what is defective it
gives perverse information. Nor again the other sources of knowledge;
for they are all based on sense-perception. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there are no
acknowledged means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to prove your view, you must give it up.
But, you will perhaps say, we proceed by means of the ordinary empirical
means and objects of knowledge!--What, we ask in reply, do you
understand by 'empirical'?--What rests on immediate unreflective
knowledge, but is found not to hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> when tested by logical
reasoning!--But what is the use, we ask, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this kind? If
logical reasoning refutes something known through some means of
knowledge, that means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is no longer authoritative!--Now you
will possibly argue as follows: 'Scripture as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Perception is
founded on Nescience; but all the same Perception is sublated by
Scripture. For as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of Scripture, i.e. Brahman, which is one
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a second, is not seen to be sublated by any ulterior
cognition, Brahman, i.e. pure non-differenced Consciousness, remains as
the sole Reality.'--But here too you are wrong, since we must decide
that something which rests on a defect is unreal, although it may remain
unrefuted. We will illustrate this point by an analogous instance. Let
us imagine a race of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> afflicted with a certain special defect of
vision, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being aware of this their defect, dwelling in some
remote mountain caves inaccessible to all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> provided with sound
eyes. As we assume all of these cave dwellers to be afflicted with the
same defect of vision, they, all of them, will equally see and judge
bright things, e.g. the moon, to be double. Now in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of these
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> there never arises a subsequent cognition sublating their
primitive cognition; but the latter is false all the same, and its
object, viz., the doubleness of the moon, is false likewise; the defect
of vision being the cause of a cognition not corresponding to reality.--
And so it is with the cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also. This cognition is based
on Nescience, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is false, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its object, viz.
Brahman, although no sublating cognition presents itself.--This
conclusion admits of various expressions in logical form. 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
under dispute is false because it is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which has
sprung from what is affected with Nescience; as the phenomenal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is.'
'Brahman is false because it is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
is.' 'Brahman is false because it is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, the rise
of which has the Untrue for its cause; as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is.'

You will now perhaps <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the following analogy. States of dreaming
consciousness--such as the perception of elephants and the like in one's
dreams--are unreal, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they are the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of real
things, viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or ill fortune (portended by those dreams). Hence
there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why Scripture--although unreal in so far as based on
Nescience--should not likewise be the cause of the cognition of what is
real, viz. Brahman.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cases are not parallel, we reply. The
conscious states experienced in dreams are not unreal; it is only their
objects that are false; these objects only, not the conscious states,
are sublated by the waking consciousness. Nobody thinks 'the cognitions
of which I was conscious in my dream are unreal'; what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> actually

same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the illusive <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which the magician produces
in the minds of other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> by means of mantras, drugs, &c., is true, and
hence the cause of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and fear; for such states of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> also
are not sublated. The cognition which, owing to some defect in the
object, the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> organ, &c., apprehends a rope as a snake is real, and
hence the cause of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and other emotions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> also is the imagination

real, and hence enables us to ascertain details belonging to the real
face. All these states of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> are real, as we conclude from
their having a beginning and actual effects.--Nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> it avail you to

them cannot be real. For ideas require only _some_ substrate in general;

appearance is present in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in question, owing to a certain defect.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> we determine to be unreal because it is sublated; the idea is
non-sublated, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> real.

Nor can you quote in favour of your view--of the real being known
through the unreal--the instance of the stroke and the letter. The
letter being apprehended through the stroke (i.e. the <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> character)
does not furnish a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the real being apprehended through the unreal;
for the stroke itself is real.--But the stroke causes the idea of the
letter only in so far as it is apprehended as being a letter, and this
'being a letter' is untrue!--Not so, we rejoin. If this 'being a letter'
were unreal it could not be a means of the apprehension of the letter;
for we neither observe nor can prove that what is non-existent and
indefinable constitutes a means.--Let then the idea of the letter
constitute the means!--In that case, we rejoin, the apprehension of the
real does not spring from the unreal; and besides, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow
therefrom that the means and what is to be effected thereby <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be one,
i.e. both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any distinction, the idea of the letter only.
Moreover, if the means were constituted by the stroke in so far as it is
_not_ the letter, the apprehension of all letters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result from the
sight of one stroke; for one stroke may easily be conceived as _not_
being _any_ letter.--But, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Devadatta'
conventionally denotes some particular man, so some particular stroke
apprehended by the eye may conventionally symbolise some particular
letter to be apprehended by the ear, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> a particular stroke may be
the cause of the idea of a particular letter!--Quite so, we reply, but
on this explanation the real is known through the real; for both stroke
and conventional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of symbolisation are real. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous
to that of the idea of a buffalo being caused by the picture of a
buffalo; that idea rests on the similarity of picture and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
depicted, and that similarity is something real. Nor can it be said
(with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to proving the pûrvapaksha by another analogous instance)
that we meet with a cognition of the real by means of the unreal in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sound (sabda) which is essentially uniform, but causes the
apprehension of different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> by means of difference of tone (nâda).
For sound is the cause of the apprehension of different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in so far
only as we apprehend the connexion of sound manifesting itself in
various tones, with the different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> indicated by those various
tones [FOOTNOTE 77:1]. And, moreover, it is not correct to argue on the
ground of the uniformity of sound; for only particular significant
sounds such as 'ga,' which can be apprehended by the ear, are really
'sound.'--All this proves that it is difficult indeed to show that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> thing, viz. Brahman, can be derived from Scripture,
if Scripture--as based on Nescience--is itself untrue.

Our opponent may finally argue as follows:--Scripture is not unreal in
the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> as a sky-flower is unreal; for antecedently to the
cognition of universal non-duality Scripture is viewed as something that
_is_, and only on the rise of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> it is seen to be unreal. At
this latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Scripture no longer is a means of cognising Brahman,
devoid of all difference, consisting of pure Intelligence; as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> on
the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> as it is such a means, Scripture _is_; for then we judge
'Scripture is.'--But to this we reply that if Scripture is not (true),
the judgment 'Scripture is' is false, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> resting on
false Scripture being false likewise, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of that knowledge, i.e.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself, is false. If the cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which rests on mist
being mistaken for smoke is false, it follows that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of that
cognition, viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> itself, is likewise unreal. Nor can it be shown
that (in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Brahman) there is no possibility of ulterior
sublative cognition; for there may be such sublative cognition, viz. the
one expressed in the judgment 'the Reality is a Void.' And if you say
that this latter judgment rests on error, we point out that according to
yourself the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is also based on error. And of our
judgment (viz. 'the Reality is a Void') it may truly be said that all
further negation is impossible.--But there is no need to continue this
demolition of an altogether baseless theory.

[FOOTNOTE 77:1. And those manifestations of sound by means of various
tones are themselves something real.]




No scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> teach a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> devoid of all difference.

We now turn to the assertion that certain scriptural texts, as e.g.

not allow of difference of motive for several terms applied to one

alternative that the distinction of several attributes predicated of one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> implies a distinction in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to which the attributes belong,
and that from this it follows that the several terms denote several
things--a result which also could not be reconciled with
'co-ordination'; for what 'co-ordination' aims at is just to convey the
idea of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> being qualified by several attributes. For the
grammarians define 'coordination' as the application, to one thing, of
several words, for the application of each of which there is a different
motive.

You have further maintained the following view:--In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'one only

on Brahman's part even in so far as qualities are concerned. We must
therefore, according to the principle that all Sâkhâs convey the same

What the phrase 'without a second' really aims at intimating is that

<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of another ruling principle different from Brahman. That

'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,' and 'it sent forth fire,'
and so on.--But how are we to know that the mere phrase 'without a
second' is meant to negative the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of all other causes in
general?--As follows, we reply. The clause 'Being only this was in the
beginning, one only,' teaches that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> when about to create
constitutes the substantial cause of the world. Here the idea of some
further operative cause capable of giving rise to the effect naturally
presents itself to the mind, and hence we understand that the added
clause 'without a second' is meant to negative such an additional cause.
If it were meant absolutely to deny all duality, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> deny also the

in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> make just the wrong <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the principle of all the--Sâkhâs
containing the same doctrine; what this principle demands is that the

over into the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> under discussion also. The same consideration
teaches us that also the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'True, knowledge', &c., teaches <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to

Your assertion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1)

being in reality the substrate only of knowledge. For by bliss we
understand a pleasing <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness. Such passages as
'consciousness, bliss is Brahman,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> mean 'consciousness--the

much insisted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> by yourself.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as something separate from mere bliss, show it to be not mere
bliss but a subject enjoying bliss; cp. 'That is one bliss of Brahman'
(Taitt. Up. II, 8, 4); 'he knowing the bliss of Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II,
9, 1). To be a subject enjoying bliss is in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> the same as to be a
conscious subject.

We now turn to the numerous <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which, according to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of our
opponent, negative the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of plurality.--'Where there is duality
as it were' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'There is not any plurality here; from

Up. IV, 4, 19);
'But when for him the Self alone has become all, by what means, and whom,
should he see?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15) &c.--But what all these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> deny
is only plurality in so far as contradicting that unity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
which depends on its being in its entirety an effect of Brahman, and
having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for its inward ruling principle and its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Self. They
do not, on the other hand, deny that plurality on Brahman's part which
depends on its intention to become manifold--a plurality proved by the

opponent urge against this that, owing to the denial of plurality
contained in other passages this last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to something not real;
for it is an altogether laughable assertion that Scripture should at
first teach the doctrine, difficult to comprehend, that plurality as
suggested by Perception and the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> belongs to

Nor is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'If he makes but the smallest "antaram" (i.

such as 'that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of sun-like lustre' (Svet. Up. III, 8). We

constitute the 'perfect object' because they are involved in Nescience;
after that goes on to say that the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> found in the Samsâra are in
the same condition--for they are essentially devoid of purity since they
reach their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nature, only later on, when through Yoga <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> has

either of the two), and is non-contradictory, we shall prove further on.
Hence also the sloka last referred to does not sublate the reality of
the world.

'That from whence these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are born, by which, when born, they live,
into which they enter when they die, endeavour to know that; that is
Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 1). From this scriptural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> we ascertain
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the cause of the origination, and so on, of the world.
After this we learn from a Purâna <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> ('He should make the Veda grow by
means of Itihâsa and Purâna; the Veda fears that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of little reading
may do it harm') that the Veda should be made to grow by Itihâsa and
Purâna. By this 'making to grow' we have to understand the elucidation
of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> studied by means of other texts,

and by the strength of their devotion had gained <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> intuition of Vedic
truth. Such 'making to grow' must needs be undertaken, since the purport
of the entire Veda with all its Sâkhâs cannot be fathomed by one who has
studied a small part only, and since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing that purport we
cannot arrive at any certitude.

The Vishnu Purâna relates how Maitreya, wishing to have his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> divinity, began to question Parâsara, 'I am desirous to

originate in future, and of what it consists, and whence proceed animate
and inanimate things; how and into what it has been resolved, and into
what it will in future be resolved?' &c. (Vi. Pu. I, 1). The questions
asked refer to the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman, the different modes of
the manifestation of its power, and the different results of
propitiating it. Among the questions belonging to the first category,
the question 'whence proceed animate and inanimate things?' relates to
the efficient and the material cause of the world, and hence the clause
'of what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> consists' is to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as implying a question as to
what constitutes the Self of this world, which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of creation,
sustentation, and dissolution. The reply to this question is given in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is He.' Now the identity expressed by this
clause is founded thereon that he (i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Vishnu) pervades the

founded on unity of substance of the pervading principle and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

(so that the question asked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be as to the causal substance of which

needless. Nor does the--maya express, as it sometimes does-e.g. in the

What 'maya' actually denotes here is abundance, prevailingness, in
agreement with Pânini, V, 4, 21, and the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

maintained that the sâstra aims only at inculcating the doctrine of one
substance <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all difference, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> in all those

expressed in the clause 'and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is he' was meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the

All this confirms the conclusion that the co-ordination expressed in
that clause is to be understood as directly teaching the relation
between a Self and its body.--The sloka, 'From Vishnu the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has

modifications of primary matter, and declares that <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to be false. But
this does not imply a denial of the duality which holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> between

that the Self which dwells in the different material bodies of gods, men,
and so on, is of one and the same kind. So the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> one himself has said,
'In the dog and the low <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> eating dog's <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> see the same';

And, moreover, the clause 'Of the Self although existing in one's own
and in other bodies' directly declares that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> different from the

Nor does the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'If there is some other (para) different (anya)
from me,' &c. (Vi. Pu. II, 13, 86) intimate the oneness of the Self; for
in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'para' and 'anya' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> express one <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
only (viz. 'other' in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'distinct from'). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'para'
there denotes a Self distinct from that of one's own Self, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'anya' is introduced to negative a character different from that of pure
intelligence: the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is 'If there is some Self
distinct from mine, and of a character different from mine which is pure
knowledge, then it can be said that I am of such a character and he of a
different character'; but this is not the case, because all Selfs are
equal in as far as their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> consists of pure knowledge.--Also the
sloka beginning 'Owing to the difference of the holes of the flute' (Vi.
Pu. II, 14, 32) only declares that the inequality of the different Selfs
is owing not to their essential nature, but to their dwelling in
different material bodies; and does not teach the oneness of all Selfs.
The different portions of air, again, passing through the different
holes of the flute--to which the many Selfs are compared--are not said
to be one but only to be equal in character; they are one in character
in so far as all of them are of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of air, while the different
names of the successive notes of the musical scale are applied to them
because they <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out by the different holes of the instrument. For an
analogous <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the several Selfs are denominated by different names,
viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and so on. Those material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> also which are parts of the
substance fire, or water, or earth, are one in so far only as they
consist of one kind of substance; but are not absolutely one; those
different portions of air, therefore, which constitute the notes of the
scale are likewise not absolutely one. Where the Purâna further says 'He

intelligent character mentioned previously which is common to all Selfs,
and the co-ordination stated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> clauses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> intimates that
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is the character of the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> denoted 'I' and 'Thou';
'abandon therefore,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> goes on to say, 'the illusion that the
difference of outward form, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and so on, causes a corresponding
difference in the Selfs.' If this explanation were not accepted (but
absolute non-difference insisted upon) there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no room for the
references to difference which the passages quoted manifestly contain.

Accordingly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> goes on to say that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> acted on the
instruction he had received, 'he abandoned the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference,
having recognised the Real.'--But on what ground do we arrive at this
decision (viz. that the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> under discussion is not meant to teach
absolute non-duality)?--On the ground, we reply, that the proper topic
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section is to teach the distinction of the Self and the
body--for this is evident from what is said in an early part of the
section, 'as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of man, characterised by hands, feet, and the like,'
&c. (Vi. Pu. II, 13, 85).--For analogous reasons the sloka 'When that

teaches neither the essential unity of all Selfs nor the oneness of the
individual Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. And that the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self should be essentially one, is no more possible than that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the Self should be one. In agreement herewith Scripture
says, 'Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of
them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating' (Mu. Up.
III, 1, 1). 'There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> drinking their reward in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of their
own works, entered into the cave, dwelling on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> summit. Those
who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them shade and light,' &c. (Ka. Up. I, 3, 1). And
in this sâstra also (i.e. the Vishnu Purâna) there are passages of
analogous import; cp. the stanzas quoted above, 'He transcends the
causal matter, all effects, all imperfections such as the gunas' &c.

The Sûtras also maintain the same doctrine, cp. I, 1, 17; I, 2, 21; II,
1, 22; and others. They therein follow Scripture, which in several
places refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> and the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as standing over
against each other, cp. e.g. 'He who dwells in the Self and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
Self, whom the Self does not know, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the Self is, who rules the
Self from within' (Bri. Up. III, 7, 22); 'Embraced by the intelligent
Self (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 21); 'Mounted by the intelligent Self (IV, 3, 35).
Nor can the individual Self become one with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self by freeing
itself from Nescience, with the help of the means of final Release; for
that which admits of being the abode of Nescience can never become quite
incapable of it. So the Purâna says, 'It is false to maintain that the
individual Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self enter into real union; for one
substance cannot <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> over into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of another substance.'
Accordingly the Bhagavad Gîtâ declares that the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> attains
only the same attributes as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. 'Abiding by this knowledge,
they, attaining to an equality of attributes with me, do neither come
forth at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of creation, nor are troubled at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of general
destruction' (XIV, 2). Similarly our Purâna says, 'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> leads
him who meditates on it, and who is capable of change, towards its own
being (âtmabhâva), in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the magnet attracts the iron' (Vi.
Pu. VI, 7, 30). Here the phrase 'leads him towards his own being' means
'imparts to him a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> like his own' (not 'completely identifies him
with itself'); for the attracted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does not become essentially one
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> attracting.

3, 2. The Vritti also says (with reference to Sû. IV, 4, 17) 'with the
exception of the business of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
of release) is equal (to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) through light'; and the
author of the Dramidabhâshya says, 'Owing to its equality (sâyujya) with
the divinity the disembodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> effects all things, like the divinity.'
The following scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> establish the same view, 'Those who
depart from hence, after having known the Self and those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> desires,

'Having reached the Self which consists of bliss, he wanders about in
these worlds having as much <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and assuming as many forms as he likes'
(Taitt. Up. III, 10, 5); 'There he moves about' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3);

vidyâs; where he says '(Brahman) connected (with qualities), since the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> refers to its qualities.' The same <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is expressed by the

4). Of him who has freed himself from his ordinary name and form, and
all the distinctions founded thereon, and has assumed the uniform
character of intelligence, it may be said that he is of the character of
Brahman.--Our Purâna also propounds the same view. The sloka (VI, 7, 91),
'Knowledge is the means to obtain what is to be obtained, viz. the

is freed from all imagination so as to be like Brahman, is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to
be attained. (The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> forms of imagination to be got rid of are so-

The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in the Bhagavad Gîtâ, 'Know me to be the kshetrajña' (XIII,

The term 'creature' in these passages denotes the entire aggregate of

All this clearly proves that the authoritative books do _not_ teach the
doctrine of one non-differenced substance; that they do _not_ teach that
the universe of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is false; and that they do _not_ deny the

The theory of Nescience cannot be proved.

We now proceed to the consideration of Nescience.--According to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
of our opponent, this entire world, with all its endless distinctions of
Ruler, creatures ruled, and so on, is, owing to a certain defect,
fictitiously superimposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the non-differenced, self-luminous
Reality; and what constitutes that defect is beginningless Nescience,
which invests the Reality, gives rise to manifold illusions, and cannot
be denned either as being or non-being. Such Nescience, he says, must
necessarily be admitted, firstly on the ground of scriptural texts, such
as 'Hidden by what is untrue' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 2), and secondly because
otherwise the oneness of the individual souls with Brahman--which is
taught by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Thou are that'--cannot be established. This
Nescience is neither 'being,' because in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> it could not be the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of erroneous cognition (bhrama) and sublation (bâdha); nor is it
'non-being,' because in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> it could not be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
apprehension and sublation [FOOTNOTE 102:1]. Hence orthodox Philosophers
declare that this Nescience falls under neither of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> opposite
categories.

Now this theory of Nescience is altogether untenable. In the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
we ask, 'What is the substrate of this Nescience which gives rise to the

soul'; for the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> itself exists in so far only as it is
fictitiously imagined through Nescience. Nor can you say 'Brahman'; for

(and this explains the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> sloka), according to your own <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> Brahman,

knowledge.--Let then non-duality be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> for an attribute (not the
essential nature) of Brahman!--This too we refuse to admit; for you
yourself have proved that Brahman, which is pure Consciousness, is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
from attributes which are objects of Consciousness.--From all this it
follows that Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is knowledge, cannot be the
substrate of Nescience: the theory, in fact, involves a flat
contradiction.

When, in the next place, you maintain that Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is
homogeneous intelligence, is invested and hidden by Nescience, you
thereby assert the destruction of Brahman's essential nature. Causing
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to disappear means either obstructing the origination of light, or
else destroying <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that exists. And as you teach that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
(consciousness) cannot originate, the 'hiding' or 'making to disappear'
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> can only mean its destruction.--Consider the following point
also. Your theory is that self-luminous consciousness, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

imperfection residing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself, conscious of itself as connected
with innumerous substrata and innumerous objects.--Is then, we ask, that
imperfection residing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> something real or something
unreal?--The former alternative is excluded, as not being admitted by
yourself. Nor can we accept the latter alternative; for if we did we
should have to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that imperfection as being either a knowing subject,
or an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, or Knowing itself. Now it cannot be 'Knowing,'
as you deny that there is any distinction in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of knowing;
and that 'Knowing,' which is the substrate of the imperfection, cannot
be held to be unreal, because that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> involve the acceptance of the
Mâdhyamika doctrine, viz. of a general void [FOOTNOTE 106:1].

And if knowers, objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and knowing as determined by those
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are fictitious, i.e. unreal, we have to assume another fundamental
imperfection, and are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> driven into a _regressuss in infinitum_.--To
avoid this difficulty, it might now be said that real <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
itself, which constitutes Brahman's nature, is that imperfection.--But
if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself constitutes the imperfection, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the
basis of the appearance of a world, and it is gratuitous to assume an
additional avidyâ to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the vorld. Moreover, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
eternal, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow from this hypothesis that no release could ever
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place. Unless, therefore, you admit a real imperfection apart from
Brahman, you are unable to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> world-error.

What, to come to the next point, do you understand by the
inexplicability (anirvakaniyatâ) of Nescience? Its difference in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
from that which _is_, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that which _is not_! A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> of such
kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be inexplicable indeed; for none of the means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
apply to it. That is to say--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of objects must be ordered
according to our states of consciousness, and every <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> presents itself in the form, either of something existing
or of something non-existing. If, therefore, we should assume that of
states of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> which are limited to this double form, the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> can be something which is neither existing nor non-existing, then
anything whatever might be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of any <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
whatever.

Against this our opponent may now argue as follows:--There is, after all,
something, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> avidyâ, or ajñâna, or by some other name, which is a
positive entity (bhâva), different from the antecedent non-existence of
knowledge; which effects the obscuration of the Real; which is the
material cause of the erroneous superimposition on the Real, of manifold
external and internal things; and which is terminated by the cognition
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the one substance which constitutes Reality. For
this avidyâ is apprehended through Perception as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Inference.
Brahman, in so far as limited by this avidyâ, is the material cause of
the erroneous superimposition--upon the inward Self, which in itself is
changeless pure intelligence, but has its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> obscured by this
superimposition--of that plurality which comprises the ahamkâra, all
acts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and all objects of knowledge. Through special forms of
this defect (i.e. avidyâ) there are produced, in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> superimposed

themselves in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and cognitions of things--such as
snakes (superimposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> ropes), silver (superimposed on shells), and
the like. Avidyâ constitutes the material cause of this entire false
world; since for a false <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> we must needs infer a false cause. That
this avidyâ or ajñâna (non-knowledge) is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of internal
Perception, follows from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that judgments such as 'I do not know',
'I do not know either myself or others,' directly present themselves to
the mind. A mental <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of this kind has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> not that non-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is the antecedent non-existence of knowledge--for such
absence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is ascertained by the sixth means of proof
(anupalabdhi); it rather is a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> which presents its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> directly,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is of the same kind as the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> expressed in the judgment 'I
am experiencing pleasure.' Even if we admit that 'absence of something'
(abhâva) can be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of perception, the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
under discussion cannot have absence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the Self for its
object. For at the very moment of such <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> exists;
or if it does not exist there can be no <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the absence of
knowledge. To explain. When I am conscious that I am non-knowing, is
there or is there not apprehension of the Self as having non-existence
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for its attribute, and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as the counterentity of
non-knowledge? In the former <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there can be no <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the
absence of knowledge, for that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply a contradiction. In the
latter case, such <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> can all the less exist, for it
presupposes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of that to which absence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> belongs as
an attribute (viz. the Self) and of its own counterentity, viz.
knowledge. The same difficulty arises if we <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the absence of

other hand, non-knowledge is viewed (not as a merely negative, but) as a
positive entity, there arises no contradiction even if there is (as
there is in fact) at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Self as qualified by

for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> non-knowledge (Nescience), does not put an end to that
non-knowledge. Hence there is no contradiction (between kaitanya and
ajñana).--But, a new objection is raised, this positive entity,
Nescience, becomes an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of witnessing Consciousness, only in so far
as it (Nescience) is defined by some particular <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> (viz. the
particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which is not known), and such objects depend for their
proof on the different means of knowledge. How then can that Nescience,
which is defined by the 'I' (as expressed e. g. in the judgment, 'I do
not know myself'), become the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of witnessing Consciousness?--There
is no difficulty here, we reply. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> whatsoever are objects of

But while
the mediation of the means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is required in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of all
those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which, as being non-intelligent (jada), can be proved only
in so far as being objects known (through some means of knowledge), such
mediation is not required in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the intelligent (ajada) inner
Self which proves itself. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of Nescience is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> possible in
all cases (including the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> 'I do not know myself'), since witnessing
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> always gives definition to Nescience.--From all this it
follows that, through Perception confirmed by Reasoning, we apprehend
Nescience as a positive entity. This Nescience, viewed as a positive
entity, is also proved by Inference, viz. in the following form: All
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> established by one of the different means of proof is preceded
by something else, which is different from the mere antecedent non-
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of knowledge; which hides the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; which is
terminated by knowledge; and which exists in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as knowledge;
because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> possesses the property of illumining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> not
illumined before;--just as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a lamp lit in the dark illumines
things.--Nor must you <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to this inference on the ground that
darkness is not a substance, but rather the mere absence of light, or
else the absence of visual perception of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and colour, and that hence
darkness cannot be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forward as a similar instance proving
Nescience to be a positive entity. For that Darkness must be considered
a positive substance follows, firstly, from its being more or less dense,
and secondly, from its being perceived as having colour.

To all this we make the following reply. Neither Perception alone, nor
Perception aided by Reasoning, reveals to us a positive entity,
Nescience, as implied in judgments such as 'I am non-knowing,' 'I know
neither myself nor others.' The contradiction which was urged above
against the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of non-knowledge being the antecedent non-existence of
knowledge, presents itself equally in connexion with non-knowledge
viewed as a positive entity. For here the following alternative presents
itself--the inner Reality is either known or not known as that which
gives definition to Nescience by being either its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> or its
substrate. If it be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> known, then there is in it no room for
Nescience which is said to be that which is put an end to by the
cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Inner Reality. If, on the other hand,
it be not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> known, how should there be a <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of Nescience
in the absence of that which defines it, viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the substrate
or of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of Nescience?--Let it then be said that what is
contradictory to non-knowledge is the clear presentation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the inner Self, and that (while there is <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of ajñâna) we
have only an obscure presentation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
being thus, there is no contradiction between the cognition of the
substrate and <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of Nescience on the one side, and the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of ajñâna on the other.--Well, we reply, all this holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> on our <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span>
also. Even if ajñâna means antecedent non-existence of knowledge, we can
say that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the substrate and <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of non-knowledge has for
its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the Self presented obscurely only; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there is no
difference between our views--unless you choose to be obstinate!

<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> we <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> non-knowledge as a positive entity or as the antecedent
non-existence of knowledge, in either <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> it comes out as what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
indicates, viz. non-knowledge. Non-knowledge means either absence of
knowledge, or that which is other than knowledge, or that which is
contradictory to knowledge; and in any of these cases we have to admit
that non-knowledge presupposes the cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of knowledge.
Even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of darkness should not require
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of light, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> when darkness is considered
under the aspect of being contrary to light, this presupposes the

according to which non-knowledge is simply the negation of knowledge.
Now antecedent non-existence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is admitted by you also, and
is an undoubted <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of consciousness; the right conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
is that what we are conscious of in such judgments as 'I am non-knowing,'
&c., is this very antecedent non-existence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which we both
admit.

It, moreover, is impossible to ascribe to Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of itself. If against this you urge that Brahman, although

You will perhaps say 'the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of its not being illumined.' But how, we
ask, can there be absence of illumination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

reduces it to an absolute non-entity. Regarding the latter alternative
we ask, 'of Brahman, which is of an absolutely homogeneous nature, which

substance which is pure light, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all division and distinction,

We, moreover, must ask the following question: 'Is this indistinctness

it does, there is no room whatever either for indistinctness the effect

Release discloses itself as something to be effected, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> non-

The assertion, again, that non-knowledge as a positive entity is proved

for proving ajñâna is a so-called contradictory one (i.e. it proves the
contrary of what it is meant to prove), in so far as it proves what is
not desired and what is different from ajñâna (for what it proves is
that there is a certain _knowledge_, viz. that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> resting on
valid means of proof has non-knowledge for its antecedent). (And with
regard to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> again we must ask <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it also has non-

argumentation) does not prove, in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> also, the antecedent
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of positive non-knowledge, it is too general (and hence not to
be trusted in any case). If, on the other hand, it does prove antecedent
non-knowledge, then this latter non-knowledge stands in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the
non-knowledge (which you try to prove by inference) being an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
consciousness, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> supposition of ajñâna as an entity

equal to that of light; we introduced it merely with reference to the

also, you must first of all allow it to the senses which are the most
eminent factors of that kind; and as in their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there exists no
different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be terminated by their activity, (i.e. nothing

argumentation is beside the point.

There are also formal inferences, opposed to the conclusion of the
pûrvapakshin.--Of the ajñâna under discussion, Brahman, which is mere
knowledge, is not the substrate, just because it is ajñâna; as shown by
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the non-knowledge of the shell (mistaken for silver) and
similar cases; for such non-knowledge abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the knowing subject.--
The ajñâna under discussion does not obscure knowledge, just because it
is ajñâna; as shown by the cases of the shell, &c.; for such non-

because it does not hide the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; whatever non-knowledge
is terminated by knowledge, is such as to hide the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge;
as e.g. the non-knowledge of the shell.--Brahman is not the substrate of
ajñâna, because it is devoid of the character of knowing subject; like
jars and similar things.--Brahman is not hidden by ajñâna, because it is
not the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; whatever is hidden by non-knowledge is the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; so e.g. shells and similar things.--Brahman is not
connected with non-knowledge to be terminated by knowledge, because it
is not the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; whatever is connected with non-knowledge
to be terminated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; as e.g. shells
and the like. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> based on valid means of proof, has not for its
antecedent, non-knowledge other than the antecedent non-existence of
knowledge; just because it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> based on valid proof; like that

does not destroy a real thing, because it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the absence of

specific power; as e.g. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and of Yogins; and as
the ajñâna consisting in a pestle (the blow of which destroys the pot).

Ajñâna which has the character of a positive entity cannot be destroyed
by knowledge; just because it is a positive entity, like jars and
similar things.

But, it now may be said, we observe that <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and other affections,
which are positive entities and produced by previous cognitions, are
destroyed by sublative acts of cognition!--Not so, we reply. Those
affections are not destroyed by knowledge; they rather <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away by
themselves, being of a momentary (temporary) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> only, and on the
cessation of their cause they do not arise again. That they are of a
momentary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> only, follows from their being observed only in
immediate connexion with the causes of their origination, and not
otherwise. If they were not of a temporary nature, each element of the
stream of cognitions, which are the cause of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and the like, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
give rise to a separate feeling of fear, and the result <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of many distinct feelings of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> (and this
we know not to be the case).--In conclusion we remark that in defining
right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as 'that which has for its antecedent another entity,
different from its own antecedent non-existence,' you do not give proof
of very eminent logical acuteness; for what <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> has it to predicate of
an entity that it is different from nonentity?--For all these reasons
Inference also does not prove an ajñâna which is a positive entity. And
that it is not proved by Scripture and arthâpatti, will be shown later
on. And the reasoning under Sû. II, 1, 4. will dispose of the argument
which maintains that of a false <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> the substantial cause also must be
false.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> see that there is no cognition of any kind which has for its
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> a Nescience of 'inexplicable' nature.--Nor can such an
inexplicable entity be admitted on the ground of apprehension, erroneous
apprehension and sublation (cp. above, p. 102). For that only which is
actually apprehended, can be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of apprehension, error and
sublation, and we have no right to assume, as an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of these states
of consciousness, something which is apprehended neither by them nor any
other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of consciousness.--'But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the shell, &c.,
silver is actually apprehended, and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there arises the
sublating <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> "this silver is not real," and it is not
possible that one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> should appear as another; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are
driven to the hypothesis that owing to some defect, we actually
apprehend silver of an altogether peculiar kind, viz. such as can be
defined neither as real nor as unreal.'--This also we cannot allow,
since this very assumption necessarily implies that one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> appears as
another. For apprehension, activity, sublation, and erroneous cognition,
all result only from one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> appearing as another, and it is not
reasonable to assume something altogether non-perceived and groundless.
The silver, when apprehended, is not apprehended as something
'inexplicable,' but as something real; were it apprehended under the
former aspect it could be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> neither of erroneous nor of
sublative cognition, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> the apprehending <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> endeavour to
seize it. For these reasons you (the anirva-kaniyatva-vâdin) also must
admit that the actual process is that of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> appearing as another.

Those also who hold other theories as to the kind of cognition under
discussion (of which the shell, mistaken for silver, is an instance)
must--whatsoever effort they may make to avoid it--admit that their
theory finally implies the appearing of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as another. The so-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> asatkhyâti-view implies that the non-existing appears as existing;
the âtmakhyâti-view, that the Self--which here means 'cognition'--
appears as a thing; and the akhyâti-view, that the attribute of one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> appears as that of another, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> acts of cognition appear as
one, and--on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the non-existence of the object--that the non-
existing appears as existing [FOOTNOTE 118:1].

Moreover, if you say that there is originated silver of a totally new
inexplicable kind, you are bound to assign the cause of this origination.
This cause cannot be the perception of the silver; for the perception
has the silver for its object, and hence has no <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> before the
origination of the silver. And should you say that the perception,
having arisen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> an object, produces the silver and thereupon makes
it its object, we truly do not know what to say to such excellent
reasoning!--Let it then be said that the cause is some defect in the
sense-organ.--This, too, is inadmissible; for a defect abiding in the
percipient <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> cannot produce an objective effect.--Nor can the
organs of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> (apart from defects) give rise to the silver; for they
are causes of cognitions only (not of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> cognised). Nor, again, the
sense-organs in so far as modified by some defect; for they also can
only produce modifications in what is effected by them, i.e. cognition.
And the hypothesis of a beginningless, false ajñâna constituting the
general material cause of all erroneous cognitions has been refuted
above.

How is it, moreover, that this new and inexplicable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> (which you
assume to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the silver perceived on the shell) becomes to us
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the idea and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'silver,' and not of some other idea and
term, e.g. of a jar?--If you reply that this is due to its similarity to
silver, we point out that in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the idea and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> presenting

Should you, on the other hand, say that we apprehend the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as silver
because it possesses the generic characteristics of silver, we ask
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> these generic characteristics are real or unreal. The former
alternative is impossible, because something real cannot belong to what
is unreal; and the latter is impossible because something unreal cannot
belong to what is real.

But we need not extend any further this refutation of an altogether ill-
founded theory.

'Those who understand the Veda hold that all cognition has for its

<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of creation, makes a similar statement: "The elements possessing
various powers and being unconnected could not, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> combination,
produce living beings, not having mingled in any way. Having combined,
therefore, with one another, and entering into mutual associations--
beginning with the principle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mahat, and extending down to the
gross elements--they formed an egg," &c. (Vi. Pu. I, 2, 50; 52). This
tripartiteness of the elements the Sûtrakâra also declares (Ve. Sû. III,
1, 3). For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> Sruti enjoins the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of Putîka sprouts when
no Soma can be procured; for, as the Mîmâmsakas explain, there are in
the Putîka plant some parts of the Soma plant (Pû. Mî. Sû.); and for the
same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> nîvâra grains may be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as a substitute for rice grains.
That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is similar to another which contains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself some part
of that other thing; and Scripture itself has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> stated that in shells,
&c., there is contained some silver, and so on. That one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "silver" and another "shell" has its <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> in the relative
preponderance of one or the other element. We observe that shells are
similar to silver; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> perception itself informs us that some elements
of the latter actually exist in the former. Sometimes it happens that
owing to a defect of the eye the silver-element only is apprehended, not
the shell-element, and then the percipient person, desirous of silver,
moves to pick up the shell. If, on the other hand, his eye is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from
such defect, he apprehends the shell-element and then refrains from
action. Hence the cognition of silver in the shell is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> one. In the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the relation of one cognition being sublated by another
explains itself through the preponderant element, according as the
preponderance of the shell-element is apprehended partially or in its
totality, and does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> depend on one cognition having for its

in the practical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and business of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> explain themselves on
the basis of everything participating in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of everything else.'

In dreams, again, the divinity creates, in accordance with the merit or
demerit of living beings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of a special nature, subsisting for a
certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> only, and perceived only by the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for which
they are meant. In agreement herewith Scripture says, with reference to
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of dreaming, 'There are no chariots in that state, no horses,
no roads; then he creates chariots, horses, and roads. There are no
delights, no joys, no bliss; then he creates delights, joys, and bliss.
There are no tanks, no lakes, no rivers; then he creates tanks, lakes,
and rivers. For he is the maker' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 10). The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of
this is, that although there are then no chariots, &c., to be perceived
by other persons, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> creates such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be perceived by the
dreaming <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> only. 'For he is the maker'; for such creative agency
belongs to him who possesses the wonderful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of making all his
wishes and plans to come true. Similarly another passage, 'That <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
who is awake in those who are asleep, shaping one lovely sight after
another, that indeed is the Bright, that is Brahman, that alone is

beyond it' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 8).--The Sûtrakâra also, after having in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
Sûtras (III, 2, 1; 2) stated the hypothesis of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
creating the objects appearing in dreams, finally decides that that
wonderful <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is produced by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> for the benefit of the

its wishes to come true--is not fully manifested, and hence it cannot
practically exercise that power. The last clause of the Katha <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> ('all

The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the white shell being seen as yellow, explains itself as
follows. The visual rays issuing from the eye are in contact with the
bile contained in the eye, and thereupon enter into conjunction with the
shell; the result is that the whiteness belonging to the shell is
overpowered by the yellowness of the bile, and hence not apprehended;
the shell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears yellow, just as if it were gilt. The bile and its
yellowness is, owing to its exceeding tenuity, not perceived by the
bystanders; but thin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it be it is apprehended by the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>

from his own eye, and through the mediation of the visual rays, aided by
the action of the impression produced on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> by that apprehension,

round rapidly, its appearance as a fiery wheel explains itself through
the circumstance that moving very rapidly it is in conjunction with all
points of the circle described <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> our being able to apprehend the
intervals. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of the perception of a real
wheel; but there is the difference that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the wheel no
intervals are apprehended, because there are none; while in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the firebrand none are apprehended owing to the rapidity of the movement.
But in the latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> also the cognition is true.--Again, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of mirrors and similar reflecting surfaces the perception of one's own
face is likewise true. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the motion of the visual rays
(proceeding from the eye towards the mirror) is reversed (reflected) by
the mirror, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> those rays apprehend the person's own face,
subsequently to the apprehension of the surface of the mirror; and as in
this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> also, owing to the rapidity of the process, there is no
apprehension of any interval (between the mirror and the face), the face
presents itself as being in the mirror.--In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of one direction
being mistaken for another (as when a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> thinks the south to be
where the north is), the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that, owing to the unseen principle (i.
e. merit or demerit), the direction which actually exists in the other
direction (for a point which is to the north of me is to the south of
another point) is apprehended by itself, apart from the other elements
of direction; the apprehension which actually takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
likewise true. Similar is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the double moon. Here, either
through pressure of the finger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the eye, or owing to some abnormal
affection of the eye, the visual rays are divided (split), and the
double, mutually independent apparatus of vision <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> originating,
becomes the cause of a double apprehension of the moon. One apparatus
apprehends the moon in her proper place; the other which moves somewhat
obliquely, apprehends at first a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> close by the moon, and then the
moon herself, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears somewhat removed from her proper place.
Although, therefore, what is apprehended is the one moon distinguished
by connection with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> places at the same time--an apprehension due to
the double apparatus of vision--yet, owing to the difference of
apprehensions, there is a difference in the character of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
apprehended, and an absence of the apprehension of unity, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> a
double moon presents itself to perception. That the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> spot is
viewed as qualifying the moon, is due to the circumstance that the
apprehension of that spot, and that of the moon which is not apprehended
in her proper place, are simultaneous. Now here the doubleness of the
apparatus is real, and hence the apprehension of the moon distinguished
by connexion with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> places is real also, and owing to this doubleness
of apprehension, the doubleness of aspect of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> apprehended, i.e.
the moon, is likewise real. That there is only one moon constituting the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the double apprehension, this is a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> for which
ocular perception by itself does not suffice, and hence what is actually
seen is a double moon. That, although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> constitute
one visual apparatus only, the visual rays being divided through some
defect of the eyes, give rise to a double apparatus--this we infer from
the effect actually observed. When that defect is removed there takes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> only one apprehension of the moon as connected with her proper
place, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the idea of one moon only arises. It is at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
quite clear how the defect of the eye gives rise to a double visual
apparatus, the latter to a double apprehension, and the latter again to
a doubleness of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of apprehension.

We have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> proved that all cognition is true. The shortcomings of
other views as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of cognition have been <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth at length

need is there, in fact, of lengthy proofs? Those who acknowledge the

Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Purâna teach Nescience.

The assertion that Nescience--to be defined neither as that which is nor
as that which is not--rests on the authority of Scripture is untrue. In
passages such as 'hidden by the untrue' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 2), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'untrue' does not denote the Undefinable; it rather means that which is
different from 'rita,' and this latter word--as we see from the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
'enjoying the rita' (Ka. Up. 1,3, 1)--denotes such actions as aim at no
worldly end, but only at the propitiation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, and

with the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'they do not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that Brahma-world, for they are
carried away by anrita' (Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 2). Again, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Then

their distributive state. What that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> aims at stating is that

'darkness' (Ri. Samh. X, 129, 3). There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no reference whatever to
something 'not definable either as being or non-being': the terms
'being' and 'non-being' are applied to different mode; of being at
different times. That the term 'darkness' denotes the collective
totality of non-intelligent <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> appears from another scriptural
passage, viz, 'The Non-evolved (avyaktam) is merged in the Imperishable
(akshara), the Imperishable in darkness (tamas), darkness becomes one
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> divinity.' True, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'darkness' denotes the subtle

'Know Prakriti to be Mâyâ,' and this proves it be something

Undefinable also. This, too, we cannot admit; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Mâyâ' does

Nor again is such Nescience to be assumed for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that otherwise

founded on unmeaningness, to ascribe to Brahman, intimated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>

that this entire world, with all its distinctions of hills, oceans, &c.,
is sprung out of the 'ajñâna' of Brahman, which in itself is pure 'jñâna,'
i.e. knowledge; thereupon confirms the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> having sprung

(41). We say 'it is' of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which is of a permanently uniform
nature, not connected with the idea of beginning, middle and end, and
which hence never becomes the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the notion of non-existence;
while we say 'it is not' of non-intelligent <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> which constantly
passes over into different states, each later <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> being out of
connexion with the earlier state. The constant changes to which non-
intelligent <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is liable are illustrated in the next sloka, 'Earth
is made into a jar,' &c. And for this reason, the subsequent sloka goes
on to say that there _is_ nothing but knowledge. This fundamental
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is, however, variously connected with manifold
individual forms of being due to karman, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> adds: 'The

Now all these slokas do not contain a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> supporting the

futile (tuchcha) or false (mithyâ), &c.




Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of a non-

Nor can we admit the assertion that Scripture teaches the cessation of
avidyâ to spring only from the cognition of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> devoid of all
difference. Such a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is clearly negatived by passages such as the
following: 'I know that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of sun-like lustre beyond darkness;

characterised by difference all Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare that final release
results from the cognition of a qualified Brahman. And that even those
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which describe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> by means of negations really aim at setting

In texts, again, such as 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that,' the co-ordination of the
constituent parts is not meant to convey the idea of the absolute unity
of a non-differenced substance: on the contrary, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'that' and

general topic of consideration in previous passages of the same section,
such as 'It thought, may I be many'; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'thou,' which stands in co-

This is in accordance with the general principle that co-ordination is
meant to express one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> subsisting in a twofold form. If such

not be known (through an independent positive judgment), but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
assumed merely on the ground that it cannot be helped. And, further,
there is really no possibility of sublation, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'that' does
not convey the idea of an attribute in addition to the mere substrate.
To this it must not be objected that the substrate was previously
concealed, and that hence it is the special function of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'that'
to present the substrate in its non-concealed aspect; for if, previously
to the sublative judgment, the substrate was not evident (as an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of consciousness), there is no possibility of its becoming the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
either of an error or its sublation.--Nor can we allow you to say that,
previously to sublation, the substrate was non-concealed in so far as
(i. e. was known as) the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of error, for in its 'non-concealed'
aspect the substrate is opposed to all error, and when that aspect
shines forth there is no room either for error or sublation.--The
outcome of this is that as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as you do not admit that there is a real

sublation. We add an illustrative instance. That with regard to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
there should arise the error that he is a mere low-caste hunter is only
possible on condition of a real additional attribute--e.g. the man's
princely birth--being hidden at the time; and the cessation of that
error is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the declaration of this attribute of princely

<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> being evident need not be declared at all, and if it is declared it
sublates no error.--If, on the other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is understood to

the internal ruler of the individual souls and possesses lordly power.
It moreover satisfies the demand of agreement with the teaching of the
previous part of the section, and it also fulfils the promise as to all

But how, a question may be asked, can we decide, on your interpretation
of the text, which of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> terms is meant to make an original

reply; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not mean to make an original assertion at all,

does make an original statement--in agreement with the principle that
'Scripture has a purport with regard to what is not established by other
means'--that is, it predicates of 'all this,' i.e. this entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

'All these creatures have their root in that which is, their dwelling

earlier one (belonging to a different section), viz. 'All this is

substances (dravya) also may occupy the position of determining
attributes (viseshana), in so far namely as they constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of

show that in ordinary speech as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the Veda co-ordination has to

substances) which determines statements of co-ordination, such as 'the
ox is broken-horned,' 'the cloth is white.' And as material bodies
bearing the generic marks of humanity are definite things, in so far
only as they are modes of a Self or soul, enunciations of co-ordination
such as 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has been <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as a man, or a eunuch, or a woman,' are

on the other hand, of substances not capable of subsisting and being
apprehended apart from others, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of their holding the position of
attributes is ascertained only from their appearing in grammatical co-
ordination.--But, an objection is raised, if it is supposed that in
sentences such as 'the Self is born, as god, man, animal,' &c., the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
of a man, god, &c., stands towards the Self in the relation of a mode,
in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in sentences such as 'the ox is broken-horned,' 'the
cloth is white,' the generic characteristic and the quality stand in the
relation of modes to the substances ('cow,' 'cloth') to which they are
grammatically co-ordinated; then there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> necessarily be simultaneous
cognition of the mode, and that to which the mode belongs, i.e. of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the Self; just as there is simultaneous cognition of the
generic character and the individual. But as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> this is
not the case; we do not necessarily observe a human, divine, or animal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the Self. The co-ordination expressed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
'the Self is a man,' is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> an 'implied' one only (the statement
not admitting of being <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in its primary literal sense).--This is not
so, we reply. The relation of bodies to the Self is strictly analogous
to that of class characteristics and qualities to the substances in
which they inhere; for it is the Self only which is their substrate and
their final cause (prayojana), and they are modes of the Self. That the
Self only is their substrate, appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that when the Self
separates itself from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the latter perishes; that the Self alone
is their final cause, appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that they exist to the end
that the fruits of the actions of the Self may be enjoyed; and that they
are modes of the Self, appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that they are mere
attributes of the Self manifesting itself as god, man, or the like.
These are just the circumstances on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> like 'cow'
extend in their <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> (beyond the class characteristics) so as to
comprise the individual also. Where those circumstances are absent, as
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of staffs, earrings, and the like, the attributive position
is expressed (not by co-ordination but) by means of special derivative
forms--such as dandin (staff-bearer), kundalin (adorned with earrings).
In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of bodies divine, human, &c., on the other hand, the
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of which it is to be mere modes of the Self which
constitutes their substrate and final cause, both ordinary and Vedic
language express the relation subsisting between the two, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
co-ordination, 'This Self is a god, or a man,' &c. That class
characteristics and individuals are invariably observed together, is due
to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of both being objects of visual perception; the Self, on the
other hand, is not such, and hence is not apprehended by the eye, while
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is so apprehended. Nor must you raise the objection that it is
hard to understand how that which is capable of being apprehended by
itself can be a mere mode of something else: for that the body's
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> actually consists in being a mere mode of the Self is
proved--just as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of class characteristics and so on--by its
having the Self only for its substrate and final cause, and standing to
it in the relation of a distinguishing attribute. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are

of the difference being that the eye has no capacity to apprehend the

passages evidently have the same purport, and hence the soul's having
its Self in Brahman--which <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is implied in the Ch. passage--must be
understood as resting thereon that the souls (together, with matter)
constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as asserted in the Taitt. <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> ('it

elsewhere also, 'All this was then unevolved; it became evolved by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
and name' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 7). The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is in
its causal or in its 'effected' condition, according as it has for its

is that the desired 'cognition of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> through one' can on our

capable of existing apart from one another, and are only occasionally
combined according to the volition of men, so that the web sometimes

a distinction and absence of all confusion, on the part of the
constituent elements of the aggregate. This being thus, it follows that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, although entering into the 'effected' condition,

and we also understand what constitutes its 'effected' condition, viz.
its abiding as the Self of non-intelligent and intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in
their gross condition, distinguished by name and form. For becoming an
effect means entering into another <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of being.

I be many' (Taitt. Up. II, 6); 'It thought, may I be many; it evolved
itself through name and form' (Ch. Up. VI, 2), teach that Brahman,
through its mere wish, appears in manifold modes. Other texts, again,
negative the opposite view, viz. that there is a plurality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> not

such as 'May I be many, may I grow forth'--which springs from Brahman's
will, and appears in the distinction of names and forms. This is proved
by clauses in those 'negativing' <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> themselves, 'Whosoever looks for
anything elsewhere than in the Self', 'from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Being there has

condition are in a subtle state, not admitting of the distinction of
names and forms while in their 'effected' gross <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> they are subject
to that distinction. On the other hand, we do not see how there is any
opening for theories maintaining the connexion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> with Nescience,

similar doctrines rest on fallacious reasoning, and flatly contradict
Scripture.

There is nothing contradictory in allowing that certain <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare
the essential distinction of matter, souls, and the Lord, and their
mutual relation as modes and that to which the modes belong, and that
other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> again represent them as standing in the relation of cause
and effect, and teach cause and effect to be one. We may illustrate this
by an analogous <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> from the Karmakânda. There six separate oblations
to Agni, and so on, are enjoined by separate so-called originative
injunctions; these are thereupon combined into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> groups (viz. the new
moon and the full-moon sacrifices) by a double clause referring to those
groups, and finally a so-called injunction of qualification enjoins the
entire <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> as something to be performed by persons entertaining a
certain wish. In a similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> certain Vedânta-texts give instruction
about matter, souls, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> as separate entities ('Perishable is
the pradhâna, imperishable and immortal Hara,' &c., Svet Up. I, 10; and
others); then other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> teach that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and souls in all their
different states constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, while the
latter is their Self ('Whose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is,' &c.); and finally
another group of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> teaches--by means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as 'Being,'

that the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self in its causal and effected states comprises

('Being only this was in the beginning'; 'In that all this has its Self;
'All this is Brahman').--That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self with <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and souls for

objectionable than that that particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Self which is invested

say 'This is a happy soul.'




Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as
the universal self.

The doctrine, again, that Nescience is put an end to by the cognition of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the Self of all can in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be upheld; for as bondage is
something real it cannot be put an end to by knowledge. How, we ask, can
any one assert that bondage--which consists in the experience of
pleasure and pain caused by the connexion of souls with bodies of
various kind, a connexion springing from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions--is
something false, unreal? And that the cessation of such bondage is to be
obtained only through the grace of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self pleased by the
devout <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of the worshipper, we have already explained. As the
cognition of universal oneness which you assume rests on a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> directly contrary to reality, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is false, the only
effect it can have is to strengthen the ties of bondage. Moreover, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
such as 'But different is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person' (Bha. Gî. XV, 17), and
'Having known the Self and the Mover as separate' (Svet. Up. I, 6),
teach that it is the cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the inward ruler different
from the individual soul, that effects the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man, i.e.
final release. And, further, as that 'bondage-terminating' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
which you assume is itself unreal, we should have to look out for
another act of cognition to put an end to it.--But may it not be said
that this terminating cognition, after having put an end to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
aggregate of distinctions antagonistic to it, immediately passes away
itself, because being of a merely instantaneous nature?--No, we reply.
Since its nature, its origination, and its destruction are all alike
fictitious, we have clearly to search for another agency capable of
destroying that avidyâ which is the cause of the fiction of its
destruction!--Let us then say that the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
itself is the destruction of that cognition!--From this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow,
we reply, that such 'terminating' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not arise at all; for
that the destruction of what is something permanent can clearly not
originate!--Who moreover should, according to you, be the cognising
subject in a cognition which has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the negation of
everything that is different from Brahman?--That cognising subject is
himself something fictitiously superimposed on Brahman!--This may not be,
we reply: he himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> be something to be negatived,
and hence an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the 'terminating' cognition; he could not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be the subject of cognition!--Well, then, let us assume that
the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself is the cognising subject!--Do you
mean, we ask in reply, that Brahman's being the knowing subject in that
'terminating' cognition belongs to Brahman's essential nature, or that
it is something fictitiously superimposed on Brahman? In the latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
that superimposition and the Nescience founded on it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> persist,
because they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be objects of the terminating cognition, and if a
further terminating act of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> were assumed, that also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
possess a triple aspect (viz. knowledge, <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> known, and subject
knowing), and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> should be led to assume an infinite series of
knowing subjects. If, on the other band, the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

the one held by us. [FOOTNOTE 146:1] And if you should say that the

Here another primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> [FOOTNOTE 148:1] finally presents itself.

by observing the speech and actions of experienced people. Now as such
speech and action always implies the idea of something to be done
(kârya), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only with reference to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to

position of authoritative means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with regard to Brahman,

this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> it must not be urged that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sentences expressive

certain outward signs--such as e.g. a pleased expression of countenance--
which are generally due to the attainment of a desired object; for the
possible causes of joy, past, present, and future, are infinite in
number, and in the given <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> other causes of joy, as e.g. the birth
having <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in an auspicious moment, or having been an easy one,

To this we make the following reply.--To <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside the universally known

that the application of such and such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to such and such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is
based on the denotative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the words. And being taught later on by

relation to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be done is baseless. The Vedânta-texts tell us
about Brahman, which is an accomplished entity, and about <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as having an unlimited result, and hence it behoves us to
undertake an enquiry into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> so as fully to ascertain its nature.

We further maintain that even on the supposition of the Veda relating
only to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be done, an enquiry into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> must be undertaken.
For 'The Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be reflected on, to be
meditated on' (Bri. Up. II, 4, 5); 'He is to be searched out, him we
must try to understand' (Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Let a Brâhmana having
known him practise wisdom' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 21); 'What is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that
small ether, that is to be sought for, that is to be understood' (Ch. Up.
VIII, 1,1); 'What is in that small ether, that is to be meditated upon'
(Mahânâr. Up. X, 7)--these and similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoin a certain action,
viz. <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman, and when we then read 'He who knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
attains the highest,' we understand that the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
meant as a reward for him who is qualified for and enters on such
meditation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself and its attributes are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> established
thereby only--that they subserve a certain action, viz. meditation.
There are analogous instances in the Karmakânda of the Veda. When an
arthavâda-passage describes the heavenly vorld as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where there is
no heat, no frost, no grief, &c., this is done merely with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to
those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which enjoin certain sacrifices on those who are desirous of
the heavenly world. Where another arthavâda says that 'those who perform
certain sattra-sacrifices are firmly established,' such 'firm
establishment' is referred to only because it is meant as the reward for
those acting on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which enjoins those sattras, 'Let him perform
the râtri-sattras' (Pû. Mî. Sû. IV, 3, 17). And where a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says that a
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> threatening a Brâhmana is to be punished with a fine of one
hundred gold pieces, this statement is made merely with reference to the
prohibitory passage, 'Let him not threaten a Brâhmana'(Pû. Mî. Sû. III,
4, 17).

We, however, really <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> theory of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
depending on their connexion with 'things to be done,' since this is not
even the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in imperative clauses such as 'bring the cow.' For you are
quite unable to give a satisfactory definition of your 'thing to be done
'(kârya). You understand by 'kârya' that which follows on the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
of action (kriti) and is aimed at by action. Now to be aimed at by
action is to be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> (karman) of action, and to be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
action is to be that which it is most desired to obtain by action
(according to the grammarian's definition). But what one desires most to
obtain is pleasure or the cessation of pain. When a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> desirous of
some pleasure or cessation of pain is aware that his <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is not to be
accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> effort on his part, he resolves on effort and
begins to act: in no <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> we observe an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to be aimed at
by action in any other <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> than that of its accomplishment depending
on activity. The prompting quality (prerakatva) also, which belongs to
objects of desire, is nothing but the attribute of their accomplishment
depending on activity; for it is this which moves to action.--Nor can it
be said that 'to be aimed at by action' means to be that which is
'agreeable' (anukûla) to man; for it is pleasure only that is agreeable
to man. The cessation of pain, on the other hand, is not what is
'agreeable' to man. The essential distinction between pleasure and pain
is that the former is agreeable to man, and the latter disagreeable
(pratikûla), and the cessation of pain is desired not because it is
agreeable, but because pain is disagreeable: absence of pain means that
a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is in his normal condition, affected neither with pain nor
pleasure. Apart from pleasure, action cannot possibly be agreeable, nor
does it become so by being subservient to pleasure; for its essential
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pain. Its being helpful to pleasure merely causes the resolve
of undertaking it.--Nor, again, can we define that which is aimed at by
action as that to which action is auxiliary or supplementary (sesha),
while itself it holds the position of something principal to be
subserved by other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (seshin); for of the sesha and seshin also no
proper definition can be given. It cannot be said that a sesha is that
which is invariably accompanied by an activity proceeding with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to
something else, and that the correlate of such a sesha is the seshin;
for on this definition the action is not a sesha, and hence that which
is to be effected by the action cannot be the correlative seshin. And
moreover a seshin may not be defined as what is correlative to an action
proceeding with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to--i. e. aiming at--something else; for it is
just this 'being aimed at' of which we require a definition, and
moreover we observe that also the seshin (or 'pradhâna') is capable of
action proceeding with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the sesha, as when e.g. a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> does
something for--let us say, keeps or feeds--his servant. This last
criticism you must not attempt to ward off by maintaining that the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> in keeping his servant acts with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to himself (to his own
advantage); for the servant in serving the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> likewise acts with a
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to himself.--And as, further, we have no adequate definition of
'kârya,' it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be inappropriate to define sesha as that which is
correlative to kârya, and seshin as that which is correlative to sesha.--
Nor, finally, may we define 'that which is aimed at by action' as that
which is the final end (prayojana) of action; for by the final end of an
action we could only understand the end for which the agent undertakes
the action, and this end is no other than the desired object. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
'what is aimed at by action' cannot be defined otherwise than what is
desired, kârya cannot be defined as what is to be effected by action and
stands to action in the relation of principal <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (pradhâna or
seshin).

(Let it then be said that the 'niyoga,' i.e. what is commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
apûrva--the supersensuous result of an action which later on produces
the sensible result--constitutes the prayojana--the final purpose--of
the action.--But) the apûrva also can, as it is something different from
the direct objects of desire, viz. pleasure and the cessation of pain,
be viewed only as a means of bringing about these direct objects, and as
something itself to be effected by the action; it is for this very
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it is something different from the action, otherwise the
action itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that which is effected by the action. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
to be effected by the action-which is expressed by means of optative and
imperative verbal forms such as yajeta, 'let him sacrifice'--is, in
accordance with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of its being connected with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as
svargakâmah, 'he who is desirous of heaven', understood to be the means
of bringing about (the enjoyment of) the heavenly world; and as the
(sacrificial) action itself is transitory, there is assumed an
altogether 'new' or 'unprecedented' (apûrva) effect of it which (later
on) is to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the enjoyment of heaven. This so-called 'apûrva'
can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be understood only with regard to its capability of
bringing about the heavenly world. Now it certainly is ludicrous to
assert that the apûrva, which is assumed to the end of firmly
establishing the independent character of the effect of the action first
recognised as such (i.e. independent), later on becomes the means of
realising the heavenly world; for as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> expressing the result of
the action (yajta) appears in syntactical connexion with 'svargakâmah'
(desirous of heaven), it does not, from the very beginning, denote an
independent <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of action, and moreover it is impossible to recognise
an independent result of action other than either pleasure or cessation
of pain, or the means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> results.--What, moreover,
do you understand by the apûrva being a final end (prayojana)?-You will
perhaps reply, 'its being agreeable like pleasure.'--Is then the apûrva
a pleasure? It is pleasure alone which is agreeable!--Well, let us then
define the apûrva as a kind of pleasure of a special nature, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by
that name!--But what proof, we ask, have you for this? You will, in the
first place, admit yourself that you do not directly experience any
pleasure springing from <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of your apûrva, which could in any
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be compared to the pleasure caused by the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the
objects of the senses.--Well, let us say then that as authoritative
doctrine gives us the notion of an apûrva as something beneficial to man,
we conclude that it will be enjoyed later on.--But, we ask, what is the
authoritative doctrine establishing such an apûrva beneficial to man?
Not, in the first place, ordinary, i.e. non-Vedic doctrine; for such has
for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> action only which always is essentially painful. Nor, in
the next place, Vedic texts; for those also enjoin action only as the
means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about certain results such as the heavenly world. Nor
again the Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of either permanent or occasional
obligation; for those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> always convey the notion of an apûrva only
on the basis of an antecedent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the apûrva as intimated by
Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> containing terms such as svargakâmah. And we, moreover, do
not observe that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> having a definite result in this
life, there is enjoyment of any special pleasure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> apûrva, in
addition to those advantages which constitute the special result of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and are enjoyed here below, as e.g. abundance of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> or freedom
from sickness. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> there is not any proof of the apûrva being a
pleasure. The arthavâda-passages of the Veda also, while glorifying
certain pleasurable results of works, as e.g. the heavenly world, do not
anywhere exhibit a similar glorification of a pleasure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> apûrva.

From all this we conclude that also in injunctory sentences that which
is expressed by imperative and similar forms is only the idea that the
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the root--as known from grammar--is to be effected by the
effort of the agent. And that what constitutes the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of roots, viz.
the action of sacrificing and the like, possesses the quality of
pleasing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, who is the inner ruler of <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and other
divinities (to whom the sacrifices are ostensibly offered), and that
through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> pleased the result of the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is
accomplished, we shall show later on, under Sû. III, 2, 37--It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
finally proved that the Vedânta-texts give information about an
accomplished entity, viz. Brahman, and that the fruit of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something infinite and permanent. Where, on the other hand,
Scripture refers to the fruit of mere works, such as the kâturmâsya-
sacrifices, as something imperishable, we have to understand this
imperishableness in a merely relative sense, for Scripture definitely
teaches that the fruit of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is perishable.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arrive at the settled conclusion that, since the fruit of mere
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is limited and perishable, while that of the cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
is infinite and permanent, there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for entering on an
enquiry into Brahman--the result of which enquiry will be the accurate
determination of Brahman's nature.--Here terminates the adhikarana of
'Enquiry.'

What then is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is here said to be an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> that should
be enquired into?--To this question the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Sûtra gives a reply.

[FOOTNOTE 148:1. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is held by the Prâbhâkara Mîmâmsakas.]

A doubt arises here. Is it possible, or not, to gain a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

not properly indicate Brahman; for as the essence of an attribute lies
in its separative or distinctive function, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result from the

itself.--But when we say 'Devadatta is of a dark complexion, is young,
has reddish eyes,' &c., we also make a statement as to several
attributes, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we are understood to refer to one Devadatta only;

attributes with one person, because we know his unity through other
means of knowledge; otherwise the distinctive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of several

under discussion, on the other hand, we do not, apart from the statement

even the different attributes combined are incapable of defining the

known in a different aspect. So-called secondary marks are the cause of
something already known from a certain point of view, being known in a
different aspect--as when it is said 'Where that crane is standing, that
is the irrigated field of Devadatta.'--But may we not say that from the

To this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> we make the following reply. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> can be
known on the basis of the origination, subsistence, and reabsorption of
the world--these characteristics occupying the position of collateral
marks. No objection can be raised against this view, on the ground that,
apart from what these collateral marks point to, no other aspect of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is known; for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> they point to that which is
known to us as possessing supreme greatness (brihattva) and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of

'Brahman' is derived). Of this Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> already known (on the basis

Moreover, in the Taitt. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under

something which is already known as the cause of the origin, and so on,

only this was in the beginning,' &c., up to 'it sent forth fire'--which
declares that the one principle denoted as 'being' is the universal
material, and instrumental cause. There the clause 'Being only this was
in the beginning, one only,' establishes that one being as the general
material cause; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'without a second' negatives the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a

I grow forth', and 'it sent forth fire', establish that one being (as
the cause and substance of everything). If, then, it is said that

The same remark holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to all following Sûtras, and the
scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> on which they are based--none of them confirm the
theory of a substance devoid of all difference. Nor, again, does
Reasoning prove such a theory; for Reasoning has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
possessing a 'proving' attribute which constantly goes <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with an
attribute 'to be proved.' And even if, in agreement with your view, we
explained the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Sûtra as <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> 'Brahman is that whence proceeds
the error of the origination, &c., of the world', we should not thereby
advance your theory of a substance devoid of all difference. For, as you
teach, the root of all error is Nescience, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is that which
witnesses (is conscious of) Nescience, and the essence of witnessing
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> consists in being pure <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (intelligence), and the
essence of pure <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> or <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is that, distinguishing itself
from the Non-intelligent, it renders itself, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as what is
different from it, capable of becoming the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of empiric <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
speech (vyavahâra). All this implies the presence of difference--if
there were no difference, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> or <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> could not be what it is,
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be something altogether void, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any meaning.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'origination and so on.'

An objection to the purport of the preceding Sûtras here presents itself.--
The assertion that Brahman, as the cause of the origination, &c., of the
world, must be known through the Vedânta-texts is unfounded; for as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> may be inferred as the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> through ordinary
reasoning, it is not something requiring to be taught by authoritative
texts.--To this objection the next Sûtra replies.




3. Because Scripture is the source (of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman).

Because Brahman, being raised above all contact with the senses, is not
an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of perception and the other means of proof, but to be known
through Scripture only; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Whence these creatures are
born,' &c., has to be accepted as instructing us regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman.--But, our opponent points out, Scripture cannot be
the source of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be known
through other means. For it is an acknowledged principle that Scripture
has <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> only with regard to what is not established by other sources
of knowledge.--But what, to raise a primâ facie counter objection, are
those other sources of knowledge? It cannot, in the first place, be
Perception. Perception is twofold, being based either on the sense-
organs or on extraordinary concentration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (yoga). Of Perception
of the former kind there are again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sub-species, according as
Perception takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> either through the outer sense-organs or the
internal organ (manas). Now the outer sense-organs produce <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
their respective objects, in so far as the latter are in actual contact
with the organs, but are quite unable to give rise to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the special <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> constituted by a supreme Self that is capable of
being conscious of and creating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of things. Nor can
internal perception give rise to such knowledge; for only purely
internal things, such as pleasure and pain, fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> its cognisance,
and it is incapable of relating itself to external objects apart from
the outer sense-organs. Nor, again, perception based on Yoga; for
although such perception--which springs from intense imagination--
implies a vivid presentation of things, it is, after all, nothing more
than a reproduction of objects perceived previously, and does not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> rank as an instrument of knowledge; for it has no means of
applying itself to objects other than those perceived previously. And if,
after all, it does so, it is (not a means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> but) a source of
error.--Nor also inference either of the kind which proceeds on the
observation of special cases or of the kind which rests on
generalizations (cp. Nyâya Sû. I, 1,5,). Not inference of the former
kind, because such inference is not known to relate to anything lying
beyond the reach of the senses. Nor inference of the latter kind,
because we do not observe any characteristic feature that is invariably
accompanied by the presence of a supreme Self capable of being conscious
of, and constructing, the universe of things.--But there _is_ such a
feature, viz. the world's being an effected thing; it being a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of
common experience that whatever is an effect or product, is due to an
agent who possesses a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the material cause, the instrumental
cause, the final end, and the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> meant to make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
produced. It further is <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of experience that whatever consists of
non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is dependent on, or ruled by, a single intelligent
principle. The former generalization is exemplified by the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of jars
and similar things, and the latter by a living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> health,
which consists of non-intelligent <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> dependent on an intelligent
principle. And that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is an effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> follows from its
consisting of parts.--Against this argumentation also objections may be
raised. What, it must be asked, do you understand by this dependence on
an intelligent principle? Not, we suppose, that the origination and
subsistence of the non-intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> should be dependent on the
intelligent principle; for in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> your example <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not help to
prove your contention. Neither the origin nor the subsistence of a
person's healthy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> depends on the intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
alone; they rather are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the merit and demerit of all
those souls which in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> share the fruition of that body--the wife,
e.g. of that person, and others. Moreover, the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> made
up of parts means that body's being connected with its parts in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
of so-called intimate relation (sama-vâya), and this requires a certain
combination of the parts but not a presiding intelligent principle. The
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of animated bodies, moreover, has for its characteristic mark
the process of breathing, which is absent in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the earth, sea,
mountains, &c.--all of which are included in the class of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
concerning which you wish to prove something--, and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> miss a
uniform kind of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> common to all those things.--Let us then
understand by the dependence of a non-intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> on an
intelligent principle, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the motion of the former depending on
the latter!--This definition, we rejoin, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> comprehend also those
cases in which heavy things, such as carriages, masses of stone, trees,
&c., are <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in motion by several intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (while what you want
to prove is the dependence of a moving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> on one intelligent
principle). If, on the other hand, you mean to say that all motion
depends on <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> in general, you only prove what requires no
proof.--Another alternative, moreover, here presents itself. As we both
admit the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of individual souls, it will be the more economical
hypothesis to ascribe to them the agency implied in the construction of
the world. Nor must you <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> on the ground that such
agency cannot belong to the individual souls because they do not possess
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of material causes, &c., as specified above; for all
intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are capable of direct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of material causes,

that intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are not capable of direct insight into the
unseen principle--called 'apûrva,' or by similar names--which resides in

insight into powers is nowhere required for undertaking work: what _is_
required for that purpose is only direct presentative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the

troubling about a similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the powers inherent in those
implements; and in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> may apply themselves
to their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (to be effected by means of sacrifices, &c.), if only they
are assured by sacred tradition of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the various powers
possessed by sacrifices and the like.--Moreover, experience teaches that
agents having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the material and other causes must be
inferred only in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those effects which can be produced, and
the material and other causes of which can be known: such things, on the
other hand, as the earth, mountains, and oceans, can neither be produced,
nor can their material and other causes ever be known; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have
no right to infer for them intelligent producers. Hence the quality of
being an effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> can be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as an argument for proving the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of an intelligent causal agent, only where that quality is
found in things, the production of which, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
causes of which, is possible at all.--Experience further teaches that
earthen pots and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are produced by intelligent agents
possessing material bodies, using implements, not endowed with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of a Supreme Lord, limited in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and so on; the quality of being
an effect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> supplies a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for inferring an intelligent agent
of the kind described only, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is opposed to the inference of
attributes of a contrary nature, viz. omniscience, omnipotence, and
those other attributes that belong--to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Soul, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
you wish to establish.--Nor does this (as might be objected) imply an
abandonment of all inference. Where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be inferred is known
through other means of proof also, any qualities of an opposite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
which maybe suggested by the inferential mark (linga) are opposed by
those other means of proof, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> must be dropped. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
under discussion, however, the thine; to be inferred is something not
guaranteed by any other means of proof, viz. a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> capable of
constructing the entire universe; here there is nothing to interfere
with the ascription to such a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of all those qualities which, on
the basis of methodical inference, necessarily belong to it.--The
conclusion from all this is that, apart from Scripture, the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> does not admit of proof.

Against all this the Pûrvapakshin now restates his <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> as follows:--It
cannot be gainsaid that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is something effected, for it is made
up of parts. We may <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> this argument in various technical forms. 'The
earth, mountains, &c., are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> effected, because they consist of
parts; in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as jars and similar things.' 'The earth, seas,
mountains, &c., are effects, because, while being big; (i.e. non-atomic),
they are capable of motion; just as jars and the like.' 'Bodies, the
world, &c., are effects, because, while being big, they are solid
(mûrtta); just as jars and the like.'--But, an objection is raised, in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> made up of parts we do not, in addition to this
attribute of consisting of parts, observe any other aspect determining
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is an effect--so as to enable us to say 'this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is
effected, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is not'; and, on the other hand, we do observe
it as an indispensable condition of something being an effect, that
there should be the possibility of such an effect being <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about,
and of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of material causes, &c. (as the
bringing about of the effect presupposes).--Not so, we reply. In the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a cause being inferred on the ground of an effect, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the cause must be inferred in accordance with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the effect. From the circumstance of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> consisting of parts we know
it to be an effect and on this basis we judge of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of the cause. A <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> recognises pots, jars and the like, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
produced, and therefrom infers the constructive skill and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
their maker; when, after this, he sees for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a kingly
palace with all its various wonderful parts and structures, he concludes
from the special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which the parts are joined that this also is an
effected thing, and then makes an inference as to the architect's
manifold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and skill. Analogously, when a living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> have once been recognised to be effects, we infer--as their maker--
some special intelligent being, possessing direct insight into their
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and skill to construct them.--Pleasure and pain, moreover, by
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are requited for their merit and demerit, are themselves of a
non-intelligent nature, and hence cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about their results
unless they are controlled by an intelligent principle, and this also
compels us to assume a being capable of allotting to each individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> a fate corresponding to its deserts. For we do not observe that non-
intelligent implements, such as axes and the like, however much they may
be favoured by circumstances of time, place, and so on, are capable of
producing posts and pillars unless they be handled by a carpenter. And
to quote against the generalization on which we rely the instance of the
seed and sprout and the like can only spring from an ignorance and
stupidity which may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> truly demoniac. The same remark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
apply to pleasure and pain if <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as a counter instance. (For in all
these cases the action which produces an effect must necessarily be
guided by an intelligent principle.)--Nor may we assume, as a 'less
complicated hypothesis,' that the guiding principle in the construction
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is the individual souls, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is acknowledged by
both parties. For on the testimony of observation we must deny to those
souls the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of seeing what is extremely subtle or remote in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (while such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> must necessarily be ascribed to a world-
constructing intelligence). On the other hand, we have no ground for
concluding that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is, like the individual souls, destitute of
such power; hence it cannot be said that other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> make
it impossible to infer such a Lord. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> rather is that as his
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is proved by the argument that any definite effect presupposes
a causal agent competent to produce that effect, he is proved at the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as possessing the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of intuitively knowing and
ruling all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in the universe.--The contention that from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
being an effect it follows that its maker does not possess lordly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
and so on, so that the proving <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prove something contrary to
the special attributes (belonging to a supreme agent, viz. omnipotence,
omniscience, &c.), is founded on evident ignorance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
inferential process. For the inference clearly does not prove that there
exist in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> inferred all the attributes belonging to the proving
collateral instances, including even those attributes which stand in no
causal relation to the effect. A certain effect which is produced by
some agent presupposes just so much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on the part of

with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> other than the particular effect; for such
incapability and ignorance do not stand towards that effect in any
causal relation. If the origination of the effect can be accounted for
on the basis of the agent's capability of bringing it about, and of his

unreasonable to ascribe causal agency to his (altogether irrelevant)

special capability and knowledge. The question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> arise moreover
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> such want of capability and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
other than the one actually effected) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be helpful towards the
bringing about of that one effect, in so far as extending to all other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> or to some other things. The former alternative is excluded
because no agent, a potter e.g., is quite ignorant of all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
but his own special work; and the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> alternative is inadmissible
because there is no definite rule indicating that there should be
certain definite kinds of want of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and skill in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of all
agents [FOOTNOTE 168:1], and hence exceptions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> arise with regard to
every special <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of want of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and skill. From this it follows
that the absence of lordly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and similar qualities which (indeed is
observed in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of ordinary agents but) in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> contributes
towards the production of the effects (to which such agents give rise)
is not proved in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of that which we wish to prove (i.e. a Lord,
creator of the world), and that hence Inference does not establish
qualities contrary (to the qualities characteristic of a Lord).

A further objection will perhaps be raised, viz. that as experience
teaches that potters and so on direct their implements through the
mediation of their own bodies, we are not justified in holding that a
bodiless Supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> directs the material and instrumental causes of
the universe.--But in reply to this we appeal to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of experience,
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons possessing men's bodies, and also venom, are driven or
drawn out of those bodies by mere will power. Nor must you ask in what
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the volition of a bodiless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> can put other bodies in motion; for
volition is not dependent on a body. The cause of volitions is not the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> but the internal organ (manas), and such an organ we ascribe to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> also, since what proves the presence of an internal organ endowed
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is just the presence of effects.--But volitions,
even if directly springing from the internal organ, can belong to
embodied <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> only, such only possessing internal organs!--This
objection also is founded on a mistaken generalization: the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> rather
is that the internal organ is permanent, and exists also in separation
from the body. The conclusion, therefore, is that--as the individual
souls with their limited capacities and knowledge, and their dependence
on merit and demerit, are incapable of giving rise to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> so variously
and wonderfully made as worlds and animated bodies are--inference
directly leads us to the theory that there is a supreme intelligent
agent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Lord, who possesses unfathomable, unlimited powers and
wisdom, is capable of constructing the entire world, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a body,
and through his mere volition brings about the infinite expanse of this
entire universe so variously and wonderfully planned. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> may
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be ascertained by means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> other than revelation, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted under the preceding Sûtra cannot be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to convey
instruction as to Brahman. Since, moreover, experience demonstrates that
material and instrumental causes always are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> absolutely distinct
from each other, as e.g. the clay and the potter with his implements;
and since, further, there are substances not made up of parts, as e.g.
ether, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> cannot be viewed as effects; we must <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> on
these grounds also to any attempt to represent the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the
universal material and instrumental cause of the entire world.

Against all this we now argue as follows:--The Vedânta-text declaring
the origination, &c., of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> does teach that there is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
possessing the characteristics mentioned; since Scripture alone is a
means for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is an effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
because it consists of parts; and that, as all effects are observed to
have for their antecedents certain appropriate agents competent to
produce them, we must infer a causal agent competent to plan and
construct the universe, and standing towards it in the relation of
material and operative cause--this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a conclusion altogether
unjustified. There is no proof to show that the earth, oceans, &c.,
although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> produced, were <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> by one creator. Nor
can it be pleaded in favour of such a conclusion that all those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
have one uniform character of being effects, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> are analogous to
one single jar; for we observe that various effects are distinguished by
difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of production, and difference of producers. Nor again
may you maintain the oneness of the creator on the ground that
individual souls are incapable of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of this wonderful
universe, and that if an additional principle be assumed to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for
the world--which manifestly is a product--it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be illegitimate to
assume more than one such principle. For we observe that individual
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> acquire more and more extraordinary powers in consequence of an
increase of religious merit; and as we may assume that through an
eventual supreme degree of merit they may in the end qualify themselves
for producing quite extraordinary effects, we have no right to assume a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of infinite merit, different from all individual souls. Nor
also can it be proved that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are destroyed and produced all at
once; for no such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is observed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, while it is, on the
other hand, observed that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are produced and destroyed in
succession; and if we infer that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are produced and destroyed
because they are effects, there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why this production and
destruction should not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> agreeing with ordinary
experience. If, therefore, what it is desired to prove is the agency of
one intelligent being, we are met by the difficulty that the proving
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (viz. the circumstance of something being an effect) is not
invariably connected with what it is desired to prove; there, further,
is the fault of qualities not met with in experience being attributed to
the subject about which something has to be proved; and lastly there is
the fault of the proving collateral instances being destitute of what
has to be proved--for experience does not exhibit to us one agent
capable of producing everything. If, on the other hand, what you wish to
prove is merely the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of an intelligent creative agent, you
prove only what is proved already (not contested by any one).--Moreover,
if you <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> the attribute of being an effect (which belongs to the
totality of things) as a means to prove the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of one omniscient
and omnipotent creator, do you <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> this attribute as belonging to all
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in so far as produced together, or in so far as produced in
succession? In the former <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the attribute of being an effect is not
established (for experience does not show that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are produced
together); and in the latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the attribute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> really prove what
is contrary to the hypothesis of one creator (for experience shows that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> produced in succession have different causes). In attempting to
prove the agency of one intelligent creative being only, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> enter
into conflict with Perception and Inference, and we moreover contradict
Scripture, which says that 'the potter is born' and 'the cartwright is
born' (and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> declares a plurality of intelligent agents). Moreover,
as we observe that all effected things, such as living bodies and so on,
are connected with pleasure and the like, which are the effects of
sattva (goodness) and the other primary constituents of matter, we must
conclude that effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have sattva and so on for their causes.
Sattva and so on--which constitute the distinctive elements of the
causal substance--are the causes of the various <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the effects.
Now those effects can be connected with their causes only in so far as
the internal organ of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> possessing sattva and so on undergoes
modifications. And that a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> possesses those qualities is due to
karman. Thus, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the origination of different
effects we must necessarily assume the connexion of an intelligent agent
with karman, whereby alone he can become the cause of effects; and
moreover the various character of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (which the various
effects presuppose) has its <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> in karman. And if it be said that it
is (not the various knowledge, &c., but) the mere wish of the agent that
causes the origination of effects, we point out that the wish, as being
specialised by its particular object, must be based on sattva and so on,
and hence is necessarily connected with karman. From all this it follows
that individual souls only can be causal agents: no legitimate inference
leads to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> different from them in nature.--This admits of various
expressions in technical form. 'Bodies, worlds, &c., are effects due to
the causal energy of individual souls, just as pots are'; 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is
not a causal agent, because he has no aims; just as the released souls
have none'; 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is not an agent, because he has no body; just as
the released souls have none.' (This last argumentation cannot be
objected to on the ground that individual souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> possession of
bodies; for in their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there exists a beginningless subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by
means of which they enter into gross bodies).--'Time is never devoid of
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> worlds; because it is time, just like the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (which
has its <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> world).'

Consider the following point also. Does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> produce his effects,
with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> or apart from his body? Not the latter; for we do not
observe causal agency on the part of any bodiless being: even the
activities of the internal organ are found only in <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> having a body,
and although the internal organ be <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> we do not know of its
producing any effects in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of released disembodied souls. Nor
again is the former alternative admissible; for in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the Lord's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> either be permanent or non-permanent. The former alternative
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply that something made up of parts is eternal; and if we once
admit this we may as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> admit that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> itself is eternal, and
then there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to infer a Lord. And the latter alternative is
inadmissible because in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no cause of the body,
different from it (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the origination of the body).
Nor could the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> himself be assumed as the cause of the body, since a
bodiless being cannot be the cause of a body. Nor could it be maintained
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> can be assumed to be 'embodied' by means of some other
body; for this leads us into a _regressus in infinitum._--Should we,
moreover, represent to ourselves the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> (when productive) as engaged
in effort or not?--The former is inadmissible, because he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a
body. And the latter alternative is excluded because a being not making
an effort does not produce effects. And if it be said that the effect, i.
e. the world, has for its causal agent one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> activity consists in

(i.e. the world) qualities not known from experience; and moreover the

instances (such as jars, &c., which are not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of agents engaged

be in agreement with observation is refuted by reasoning which itself is
in agreement with observation, and we hence conclude that Scripture is
the only source of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with regard to a supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> that is the

What Scripture tells us
of is a being which comprehends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself infinite, altogether
unsurpassable excellences such as omnipotence and so on, is antagonistic
to all evil, and totally different in character from whatever is
cognised by the other means of knowledge: that to such a being there
should attach even the slightest imperfection due to its similarity in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> known by the ordinary means of knowledge, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
altogether excluded.--The Pûrvapakshin had remarked that the oneness of
the instrumental and the material cause is neither <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of observation
nor capable of proof, and that the same holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to the
theory that certain non-composite substances such as ether are <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>
things; that these points also are in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> contrary to reason, we
shall show later on under Sû. I, 4, 23, and Sû. II, 3, 1.

The conclusion meanwhile is that, since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> does not fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
sphere of the other means of knowledge, and is the topic of Scripture
only, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'from whence these creatures,' &c., _does_ give
authoritative information as to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> possessing the characteristic
qualities so often enumerated. Here terminates the adhikarana of
'Scripture being the source.'

A new objection here presents itself.--Brahman does not indeed fall
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the province of the other means of knowledge; but all the same
Scripture does not give authoritative information regarding it: for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not something that has for its purport activity or cessation
from activity, but is something fully established and accomplished
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself.--To this objection the following Sûtra replies.

possess both, and so on. We cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> point to any definite want

4. But that (i.e. the authoritativeness of Scripture with regard to
Brahman) exists on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the connexion (of Scripture with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man).

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'but' is meant to rebut the objection raised. _That_, i.e. the
authoritativeness of Scripture with regard to Brahman, is possible, on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of samanvaya, i.e. connexion with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man--that
is to say because the scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are connected with, i.e. have for
their subject, Brahman, which constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man. For
such is the connected <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> which
constitutes the Upanishads--'That from whence these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are
born'(Taitt. Up. III, 1, 1). 'Being only this was in the beginning, one,

And of aggregates of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
which are capable of giving information about accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> known
through the ordinary means of ascertaining the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of words, and
which connectedly refer to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the cause of the
origination, subsistence, and destruction of the entire world, is
antagonistic to all imperfection and so on, we have no right to say that,
owing to the absence of a purport in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of activity or cessation
of activity, they really refer to something other than Brahman.

For all instruments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> have their end in determining the

itself to a final purpose, but the latter rather adapts itself to the
means of knowledge. Nor is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that where there is no connexion with
activity or cessation of activity all aim is absent; for in such cases
we observe connexion with what constitutes the general aim, i.e. the
benefit of man. Statements of accomplished <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of fact--such as 'a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> to thee.' 'This is no snake'--evidently have an aim, viz. in
so far as they either give rise to joy or remove pain and fear.

Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Pûrvapakshin now argues as follows. The Vedânta-
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not impart <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman; for unless related to activity
or the cessation of activity, Scripture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be unmeaning, devoid of
all purpose. Perception and the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> indeed have
their aim and end in supplying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of accomplished

at some practical purpose. For neither in ordinary speech nor in the
Veda do we ever observe the employment of sentences devoid of a
practical purpose: the employment of sentences not having such a purpose
is in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> impossible. And what constitutes such purpose is the
attainment of a desired, or the avoidance of a non-desired object, to be
effected by some action or abstention from action. 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> desirous

assertion that such sentences also as refer to accomplished things--'a

viz. joy or the cessation of fear, we ask <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in such cases the
attainment of man's purpose results from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> or <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> itself, as e.
g. the birth of a son, or from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> or fact.--You
will reply that as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> although actually existing is of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to

his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the thing.--It then appears, we rejoin, that man's
purpose is effected through mere knowledge, even if there is no actual
thing; and from this it follows that Scripture, although connected with
certain aims, is not a means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for the actual <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
things. In all cases, therefore, sentences have a practical purpose;
they determine either some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of activity or cessation from activity,
or else some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of knowledge. No sentence, therefore, can have for its
purport an accomplished thing, and hence the Vedânta-texts do not convey
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as such an accomplished entity.

At this point somebody propounds the following view. The Vedânta-texts
_are_ an authoritative means for the cognition of Brahman, because as a
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> they also aim at something to be done. What they really
mean to teach is that Brahman, which in itself is pure homogeneous
knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a second, not connected with a world, but is, owing
to beginningless Nescience, viewed as connected with a world, should be
freed from this connexion. And it is through this process of dissolution
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> becomes the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of an injunction.--But
which <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> embody this injunction, according to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its
pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> is to be realised through the dissolution of this apparent
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with its distinction of knowing subjects and objects of
knowledge?--Texts such as the following: 'One should not see (i. e.
represent to oneself) the seer of seeing, one should not think the
thinker of thinking' (Bri. Up. III, 4, 2); for this means that we should
realise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of pure Seeing (knowledge), <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the
distinction of seeing agents and objects of sight. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is indeed
accomplished through itself, but all the same it may constitute an
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be accomplished, viz. in so far as it is being disengaged from
the apparent world.

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> (the Mîmâmsaka rejoins) is unfounded. He who maintains that
injunction constitutes the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of sentences must be able to assign
the injunction itself, the qualification of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to whom the
injunction is addressed, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the injunction, the means to
carry it out, the special mode of the procedure, and the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> carrying
out the injunction. Among these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> the qualification of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
to whom the injunction addresses itself is something not to be enjoined
(but existing previously to the injunction), and is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> either
of cause (nimitta) or a result aimed at (phala). We then have to decide
what, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under discussion (i.e. the alleged injunction <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth by the antagonist), constitutes the qualification of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to
whom the injunction addresses itself, and <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
a cause or of a result.--Let it then be said that what constitutes the
qualification in our <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is the intuition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
(on the part of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to whom the injunction is addressed).--This,
we rejoin, cannot be a cause, as it is not something previously
established; while in other cases the nimitta is something so
established, as e.g. 'life' is in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to whom the
following injunction is addressed, 'As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> lasts he is to
make the Agnihotra-oblation.' And if, after all, it were admitted to be
a cause, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that, as the intuition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

to be accomplished even subsequently to final release, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
as the Agnihotra has to be performed permanently as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> lasts.--
Nor again can the intuition of Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> be a result; for
then, being the result of an action enjoined, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be something non-
permanent, like the heavenly world.--What, in the next place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
the 'object to be accomplished' of the injunction? You may not reply
'Brahman'; for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something permanent it is not something
that can be realised, and moreover it is not denoted by a verbal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
(such as denote actions that can be accomplished, as e.g. yâga,
sacrifice).--Let it then be said that what is to be realised is Brahman,
in so far as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the world!--But, we rejoin, even if this be
accepted as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be realised, it is not the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> (vishaya) of
the injunction--that it cannot be for the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> just stated--but
its final result (phala). What moreover is, on this last assumption, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be realised--Brahman, or the cessation of the apparent world?--
Not Brahman; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something accomplished, and from your
assumption it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that it is not eternal.--Well then, the
dissolution of the world!--Not so, we reply; for then it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> only is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the injunction!--This, too, cannot be,
we rejoin; that dissolution is the result (phala) and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the injunction. For the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> means
final release; and that is the result aimed at. Moreover, if the
dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the injunction, that
dissolution <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow from the injunction, and the injunction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be carried out by the dissolution of the world; and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of vicious mutual dependence.--We further ask--is the world, which is to
be put an end to, false or real?--If it is false, it is put an end to by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone, and then the injunction is needless. Should you reply
to this that the injunction puts an end to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in so far as it
gives rise to knowledge, we reply that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> springs of itself from
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> truth: hence there is no need of
additional injunctions. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
sublates the entire false <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> distinct from Brahman, the injunction
itself with all its adjuncts is seen to be something baseless.--If, on
the other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is true, we ask--is the injunction, which puts
an end to the world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself or something different from Brahman?
If the former, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot exist at all: for what terminates it,
viz. Brahman, is something eternal; and the injunction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being
<span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> itself Cannot be accomplished by means of certa n actions.--Let
then the latter alternative be accepted!--But in that case, the niyoga
being something which is accomplished by a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of performances the
function of which it is to put an end to the entire world, the
performing <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> himself perishes (with the rest of the world), and the
niyoga <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> remains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a substrate. And if everything apart from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is put an end to by a performance the function of which it is to
put an end to the world, there remains no result to be effected by the
niyoga, consequently there is no release.

Further, the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot constitute the instrument
(karana) in the action enjoined, because no mode of procedure
(itikartavyatâ) can be assigned for the instrument of the niyoga, and
unless assisted by a mode of procedure an instrument cannot operate,--
But why is there no 'mode of procedure'?--For the following reasons. A
mode of procedure is either of a positive or a negative kind. If
positive, it may be of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, viz. either such as to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the
instrument or to assist it. Now in our <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there is no room for either
of these alternatives. Not for the former; for there exists in our <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
nothing analogous to the stroke of the pestle (which has the manifest
effect of separating the rice grains from the husks), whereby the
visible effect of the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> could be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
about. Nor, secondly, is there the possibility of anything assisting the
instrument, already existing independently, to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about its effect;
for owing to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of such an assisting factor the instrument
itself, i.e. the cessation of the apparent world, cannot be established.
Nor must you say that it is the cognition of the non-duality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
that brings about the means for the dissolution of the world; for, as we
have already explained above, this cognition directly brings about final
Release, which is the same as the dissolution of the world, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
there is nothing <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to be effected by special means.--And if finally
the mode of procedure is something purely negative, it can, owing to
this its nature, neither <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about nor in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> assist the
instrumental cause. From all this it follows that there is no
possibility of injunctions having for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the realisation of
Brahman, in so far as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the world.

Here another primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the question is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth.--It must be
admitted that the Vedânta-texts are not means of authoritative knowledge,
since they refer to Brahman, which is an accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> (not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
'to be accomplished'); nevertheless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself is established, viz.
by means of those passages which enjoin <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (as something 'to be
done'). This is the purport of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as the following: 'The Self is
to be seen, to be heard, to be reflected on, to be meditated upon' (Bri.
Up. II, 4, 5); 'The Self which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> must be searched out'
(Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him as the Self' (Bri. Up.
I, 4, 7); 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Self as his world' (Bri. Up. I, 4,
15).--These injunctions have <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> for their object, and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
again is defined by its own <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> only, so that the injunctive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
immediately suggests an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation; and as such an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
there presents itself, the 'Self' mentioned in the same sentence. Now
there arises the question, What are the characteristics of that Self?
and in reply to it there come in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'The True, knowledge,
infinite is Brahman'; 'Being only this was in the beginning, one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
a second.' As these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> give the required special information, they
stand in a supplementary relation to the injunctions, and hence are
means of right knowledge; and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the purport of the Vedânta-
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> includes Brahman--as having a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> which
is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of injunction. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'One only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a second'
(Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'That is the true, that is the Self (Ch. Up. VI, 8,
7); 'There is here not any plurality' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 19), teach that
there is one Reality only, viz. Brahman, and that everything else is
false. And as Perception and the other means of proof, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that
part of Scripture which refers to action and is based on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
plurality, convey the notion of plurality, and as there is contradiction
between plurality and absolute Unity, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the conclusion that the
idea of plurality arises through beginningless avidyâ, while absolute
Unity alone is real. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is through the injunction of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
on Brahman--which has for its result the intuition of Brahman--that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
reaches final release, i.e. becomes one with Brahman, which consists of
non-dual <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of all the manifold distinctions that spring
from Nescience. Nor is this becoming one with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be accomplished
by the mere cognition of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of certain Vedânta-texts; for this is
not observed--the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> rather being that the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality persists
even after the cognition of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of those texts--, and, moreover,
if it were so, the injunction by Scripture of hearing, reflecting, &c.,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be purposeless.

To this reasoning the following objection might be raised.--We observe
that when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is told that what he is afraid of is not a snake, but
only a rope, his <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> comes to an end; and as bondage is as unreal as
the snake imagined in the rope it also admits of being sublated by
knowledge, and may therefore, apart from all injunction, be put an end
to by the simple comprehension of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of certain texts. If final
release were to be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by injunctions, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that it
is not eternal--not any more than the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the like; while
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> its eternity is admitted by every one. Acts of religious merit,
moreover (such as are prescribed by injunctions), can only be the causes
of certain results in so far as they give rise to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> capable of
experiencing those results, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> necessarily produce the so-called
samsâra-state (which is opposed to final release, and) which consists in
the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> with some sort of body, <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> or low. Release,
therefore, is not something to be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by acts of religious
merit. In agreement herewith Scripture says, 'For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as it
is in the body, there is no release from pleasure and pain; when it is
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the body, then neither pleasure nor pain touch it' (Ch. Up.
VIII, 12, 1). This <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> declares that in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of release, when
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is freed from the body, it is not touched by either pleasure or
pain--the effects of acts of religious merit or demerit; and from this
it follows that the disembodied <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is not to be accomplished by acts
of religious merit. Nor may it be said that, as other special results
are accomplished by special injunctions, so the disembodied <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is to
be accomplished by the injunction of meditation; for that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is
essentially something _not_ to be effected. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> say,
'The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knows the Self as bodiless among the bodies, as
persisting among non-persisting things, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and all-pervading; he
does not grieve' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 22); 'That <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> breath,

Up. II, 1, 2).--
Release which is a bodiless <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is eternal, and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be
accomplished through meritorious acts.

In agreement herewith Scripture says, 'That which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> seest apart from
merit (dharma) and non-merit, from what is done and not done, from what
exists and what has to be accomplished--tell me that' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 14).--
Consider what follows also. When we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of something being
accomplished (effected-sâdhya) we mean one of four things, viz. its
being originated (utpatti), or obtained (prâpti), or modified (vikriti),

(samskriti). Now in neither of these four senses can final Release be
said to be accomplished. It cannot be originated, for being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
itself it is eternal. It cannot be attained: for Brahman, being the Self,
is something eternally attained. It cannot be modified; for that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
imply that like sour milk and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (which are capable of
change) it is non-eternal. Nor finally can it be made 'ready' or 'fit.'
A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is made ready or fit either by the removal of some imperfection
or by the addition of some perfection. Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be freed from
any imperfection, for it is eternally faultless; nor can a perfection be
added to it, for it is absolutely perfect. Nor can it be improved in the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of improving a mirror, viz. by polishing it; for
as it is absolutely changeless it cannot become the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of any action,
either of its own or of an outside agent. And, again, actions affecting
the body, such as bathing, do not 'purify' the Self (as might possibly
be maintained) but only the organ of Egoity (ahamkartri) which is the
product of avidyâ, and connected with the body; it is this same
ahamkartri also that enjoys the fruits springing from any action <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
the body. Nor must it be said that the Self _is_ the ahamkartri; for the
Self rather is that which is conscious of the ahamkartri. This is the
teaching of the mantras: 'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other
looks on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1); 'When he is in union with

is so, what then is the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the comprehension of the texts?--It is of
use, we reply, in so far as it puts an end to the obstacles in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

what is effected by the comprehension of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> is merely
the cessation of impediments in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of Release. This cessation
itself, although something effected, is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that kind of
nonexistence which results from the destruction of something existent,
and as such does not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away.--Texts such as 'He knows Brahman, he
becomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); 'Having known him he passes beyond
death' (Svet. Up. III,8), declare that Release follows immediately on
the cognition of Brahman, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> negative the intervention of
injunctions.--Nor can it be maintained that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is related to action
in so far as constituting the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the action either of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
or of meditation; for scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> deny its being an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> in
either of these senses. Compare 'Different is this from what is known,
and from what is unknown' (Ke. Up. II, 4); 'By whom he knows all this,
whereby should he know him?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'That do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> know as
Brahman, not that on which they meditate as being this' (Ke. Up. II, 4).
Nor does this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> imply that the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> have no <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> at all;
for it is their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to put an end to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference springing
from avidyâ. Scripture does not objectivise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in any definite form,
but rather teaches that its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is to be non-object, and thereby
puts an end to the distinction, fictitiously suggested by Nescience, of
knowing subjects, acts of knowledge, and objects of knowledge. Compare
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'You should not see a seer of seeing, you should not think a
thinker of thought,' &c. (Bri. Up. III, 4, 2).--Nor, again, must it be
said that, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone puts an end to bondage, the injunctions of
hearing and so on are purposeless; for their function is to cause the
origination of the comprehension of the texts, in so far as they divert
from all other alternatives the student who is naturally inclined to
yield to distractions.--Nor, again, can it be maintained that a
cessation of bondage through mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is never observed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
place; for as bondage is something false (unreal) it cannot possibly
persist after the rise of knowledge. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it is a mistake
to maintain that the cessation of bondage takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> only after the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the body. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> inspired by the imagined snake
should come to an end, it is required only that the rope should be
recognised as what it is, not that a snake should be destroyed. If the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> were something real, its destruction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be necessary; but being

He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> bondage does not come to an
end, in him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> has not arisen; this we infer from the effect
of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> not being observed in him. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> persist or
not, he who has reached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is released from that very moment.--
The general conclusion of all this is that, as Release is not something
to be accomplished by injunctions of meditation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not proved
to be something standing in a supplementary relation to such injunctions;
but is rather proved by (non-injunctory) texts, such as 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that';
'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman'; 'This Self is Brahman.'

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> (the holder of the dhyâna-vidhi theory rejoins) is untenable;
since the cessation of bondage cannot possibly spring from the mere
comprehension of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of texts. Even if bondage were something
unreal, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> capable of sublation by knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> being
something direct, immediate, it could not be sublated by the indirect
comprehension of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of texts. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> directly conscious of a
snake before him is told by a competent by-stander that it is not a
snake but merely a rope, his <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> is not dispelled by a mere cognition
contrary to that of a snake, and due to the information received; but
the information brings about the cessation of his <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
it rouses him to an activity aiming at the direct perception, by means
of his senses, of what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> before him really is. Having at first
started back in <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the imagined snake, he now proceeds to ascertain
by means of ocular perception the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the thing, and having
accomplished this is freed from fear. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be correct to say
that in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> (viz. of the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> informing) produce this
perceptional knowledge; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are not a sense-organ, and among the
means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> it is the sense-organs only that give rise to direct
knowledge. Nor, again, can it be pleaded that in the special <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> sentences may give rise to direct knowledge, owing to the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> concerned has cleansed himself of all imperfection
through the performance of actions not aiming at immediate results, and
has been withdrawn from all outward objects by hearing, reflection, and
meditation; for in other cases also, where special impediments in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> are being removed, we never observe that the special
means of knowledge, such as the sense-organs and so on, operate outside
their proper limited sphere.--Nor, again, can it be maintained that
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> acts as a means helpful towards the comprehension of texts;
for this leads to vicious reciprocal dependence--when the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the

this were so the comprehension of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> could not be a means helpful
towards meditation: <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> does not give rise to
eagerness with regard to another thing!--For <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> which consists
in uninterrupted remembrance of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> cognised, the cognition of the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of texts, moreover, forms an indispensable prerequisite; for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman--the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation--cannot originate from
any other source.--Nor can it be said that that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> on which

'thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that,' and the like. For, we ask, has the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> the
same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> as the latter, or a different one? On the former alternative
we are led to the same vicious reciprocal dependence which we noted
above; and on the latter alternative it cannot be shown that <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
gives rise to eagerness with regard to the latter kind of knowledge.
Moreover, as <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> presupposes plurality comprising an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
meditation, a meditating subject and so on, it really cannot in any
perceptible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be helpful towards the origination of the comprehension
of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of texts, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of which is the oneness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all plurality: he, therefore, who maintains that Nescience
comes to an end through the mere comprehension of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
really implies that the injunctions of hearing, reflection, and
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> are purposeless.

The conclusion that, since direct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> cannot spring from texts,
Nescience is not terminated by the comprehension of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of texts,
disposes at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the hypothesis of the so-called 'Release in
this life' (jîvanmukti). For what definition, we ask, can be given of
this 'Release in this life'?--'Release of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> joined to a
body'!--You might as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> say, we reply, that your mother never had any
children! You have yourself proved by scriptural passages that 'bondage'
means the being joined to a body, and 'release' being <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from a body!--
Let us then define jîvanmukti as the cessation of embodiedness, in that
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> that a person, while the appearance of embodiedness persists, is
conscious of the unreality of that appearance.--But, we rejoin, if the
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the unreality of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> puts an end to embodiedness,
how can you say that jîvanmukti means release of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> while joined to
a body? On this explanation there remains no difference whatsoever
between 'Release in this life' and Release after death; for the latter
also can only be defined as cessation of the false appearance of
embodiedness.--Let us then say that a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is 'jîvanmukta' when the
appearance of embodiedness, although sublated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
persists in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the appearance of the moon being double
persists (even after it has been recognised as false).--This too we
cannot allow. As the sublating act of cognition on which Release depends
extends to everything with the exception of Brahman, it sublates the
general defect due to causal Nescience, inclusive of the particular
erroneous appearance of embodiedness: the latter being sublated in this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> cannot persist. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the double moon, on the other hand,
the defect of vision on which the erroneous appearance depends is _not_
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the sublative <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> of cognition, i.e. the cognition of the
oneness of the moon, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> remains non-sublated; hence the
false appearance of a double moon may persist.--Moreover, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'For

Âpastamba also
rejects the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of jivanmukti, 'Abandoning the Vedas, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and
the next, he (the Samnyâsin) is to seek the Self. (Some say that) he
obtains salvation when he knows (the Self). This opinion is contradicted
by the sâstras. (For) if Salvation were obtained when the Self is known,
he should not feel any pain even in this world. Hereby that which
follows is explained' (Dh. Sû. II, 9, 13-17).--This refutes also the
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that Release is obtained through mere knowledge.--The conclusion to
be drawn from all this is that Release, which consists in the cessation
of all Plurality, cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> lives. And we

means of the injunctions of meditation, the result of which is direct

non-eternal; for what is effected is not Release itself, but only the
cessation of what impedes it. Moreover, the injunction does not directly
produce the cessation of Bondage, but only through the mediation of the
direct cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as consisting of pure knowledge, and not
connected with a world. It is this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only which the injunction
produces.--But how can an injunction cause the origination of knowledge?--

immediate result cause the origination of knowledge?--You will perhaps
reply 'by means of purifying the mind' (manas); but this reply may be
given by me also.--But (the objector resumes) there is a difference. On
my <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> Scripture produces <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> purified by works;

certain <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as the following: 'They seek to know him by sacrifice,

not apprehended by the eye nor by speech' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8); 'But by a

'What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> meditate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> as this world, that is not Brahman; know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

Brahman' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be irrational, and the injunctions of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
Self would--be meaningless.--The outcome of all this is that unreal
Bondage which appears in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a plurality of knowing subjects,
objects of knowledge, &c., is put an end to by the injunctions of
meditation, the fruit of which is direct intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.

Nor can we approve of the doctrine held by some that there is no
contradiction between difference and non-difference; for difference and
non-difference cannot co-exist in one thing, any more than coldness and
heat, or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and darkness.--Let us first hear in detail what the
holder of this so-called bhedâbheda <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> has to say. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> must be ordered in agreement with our cognitions. Now we are
conscious of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as different and non-different at the same time:
they are non-different in their causal and generic aspects, and
different in so far as viewed as effects and individuals. There indeed
is a contradiction between <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and darkness and so on; for these
cannot possibly exist together, and they are actually met with in
different abodes. Such contradictoriness is not, on the other hand,
observed in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of cause and effect, and genus and individual; on
the contrary we here distinctly apprehend one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
aspects--'this jar is clay', 'this cow is short-horned.' The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is
that experience does not show us anything that has one aspect only. Nor
can it be said that in these cases there is absence of contradiction
because as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> consumes grass so non-difference absorbs difference; for
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which exists as clay, or gold, or cow, or horse, &c., at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> exists as jar or diadem, or short-horned cow or mare.
There is no command of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> to the effect that one aspect only
should belong to each thing, non-difference to what is non-different,
and difference to what is different.--But one aspect only belongs to
each thing, because it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are perceived!--On the
contrary, we reply, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have twofold aspects, just because it is _thus_
that they are perceived. No man, however wide he may open his eyes, is
able to distinguish in an object--e.g. a jar or a cow--placed before him
which part is the clay and which the jar, or which part is the generic
character of the cow and which the individual cow. On the contrary, his
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> finds its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> expression in the following judgments: 'this jar
is clay'; 'this cow is short-horned.' Nor can it be maintained that he
makes a distinction between the cause and genus as objects of the idea
of persistence, and the effect and individual as objects of the idea of
discontinuance (difference); for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> there is no
perception of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elements in separation. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may look ever so
close at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> placed before him, he--will not be able to perceive a
difference of aspect and to point out 'this is the persisting, general,
element in the thing, and that the non-persistent, individual, element.'
Just as an effect and an individual give rise to the idea of one thing,
so the effect plus cause, and the individual _plus_ generic character,
also give rise to the idea of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> only. This very circumstance
makes it possible for us to recognise each individual thing, placed as
it is among a multitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> differing in place, time, and
character.--Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being cognised as endowed with a twofold
aspect, the theory of cause and effect, and generic character and
individual, being absolutely different, is clearly refuted by perception.

But, an objection is raised, if on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of grammatical co-ordination
and the resulting idea of oneness, the judgment 'this pot is clay' is
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to express the relation of difference, _plus_ non-difference, we
shall have analogously to infer from judgments such as 'I am a man', 'I
am a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> being' that the Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> also stand in the
bhedâbheda-relation; the theory of the co-existence of difference and
non-difference will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> act like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has lit on his
hearth, and which in the end consumes the entire house!--This, we reply,
is the baseless idea of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has not duly considered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

correct principle is that all reality is determined by states of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> not sublated by valid means of proof. The imagination,
however, of the identity of the Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is sublated by all the
means of proof which apply to the Self: it is in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> no more valid than
the imagination of the snake in the rope, and does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> prove
the non-difference of the two. The co-ordination, on the other hand,
which is expressed in the judgment 'the cow is short-horned' is never
observed to be refuted in any way, and hence establishes the bhedâbheda-
relation.

For the same reasons the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (jîva) is not absolutely
different from Brahman, but stands to it in the bhedâbheda-relation in
so far as it is a part (amsa) of Brahman. Its non-difference from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is essential (svâbhâvika); its difference is due to limiting
adjuncts (aupâdhika). This we know, in the first place, from those
scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare non-difference--such as 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that'
(Ch. Up. VI); 'There is no other seer but he' (Bri. Up. III, 7, 23);
'This Self is Brahman' (Bri. Up. II, 5, 19); and the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> from the
Brahmasûkta in the Samhitopanishad of the Âtharvanas which, after having
said that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> and Earth, continues, 'The fishermen are

<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9),
which teach that in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> enters into

17 meant that the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is separate from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow
that it is deficient in lordly power; and if this were so the Sûtra

reasons, non-difference is the essential condition; while the
distinction of the souls from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and from each other is due to
their limiting adjuncts, i.e. the internal organ, the sense-organs, and
the body. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> indeed is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts and omnipresent; but through
its adjuncts it becomes capable of division just as ether is divided by
jars and the like. Nor must it be said that this leads to a
reprehensible mutual dependence--Brahman in so far as divided entering
into conjunction with its adjuncts, and again the division in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

and Brahman's connexion with them are due to action (karman), and the
stream of action is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a beginning. The limiting adjuncts to which

no fault can be found with our theory.--The non-difference of the souls

due to the Upâdhis. These Upâdhis, on the other hand, are at the same

distinction if non-essential), and if we admitted such, we should again
have to assume further Upâdhis, and so on _in infinitum_. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
hold that the Upâdhis are produced, in accordance with the actions of
the individual souls, as essentially non-different and different from
Brahman.

To this bhedâbheda <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Pûrvapakshin now objects on the following
grounds:--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of Vedânta-texts aims at enjoining
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on a non-dual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essence is reality, intelligence,
and bliss, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> sets forth the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of non-difference; while on the
other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the karma-section of the Veda, and likewise perception and
the other means of knowledge, intimate the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the difference of
things. Now, as difference and non-difference are contradictory, and as
the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference may be accounted for as resting on beginningless
Nescience, we conclude that universal non-difference is what is real.--
The tenet that difference and non-difference are not contradictory
because both are proved by our consciousness, cannot be upheld. If one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> has different characteristics from another there is distinction
(bheda) of the two; the contrary condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> constitutes non-
distinction (abheda); who in his senses then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> maintain that these
two-suchness and non-suchness--can be found together? You have
maintained that non-difference belongs to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> viewed as cause and
genus, and difference to the same viewed as effect and individual; and
that, owing to this twofold aspect of things, non-difference and
difference are not irreconcileable. But that this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> also is untenable,
a presentation of the question in definite alternatives will show. Do
you mean to say that the difference lies in one aspect of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> and
the non-difference in the other? or that difference _and_ non-difference
belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> possessing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects?--On the former alternative
the difference belongs to the individual and the non-difference to the
genus; and this implies that there is no one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> with a double aspect.
And should you say that the genus and individual <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> constitute one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> only, you abandon the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that it is difference of aspect which
takes away the contradictoriness of difference and non-difference. We
have moreover remarked already that difference in characteristics and
its opposite are absolutely contradictory.--On the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> alternative we
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects of different kind and an unknown <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> supposed to be
the substrate of those aspects; but this assumption of a triad of
entities proves only their mutual difference of character, not their non-
difference. Should you say that the non-contradictoriness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects
constitutes simultaneous difference and non-difference in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
which is their substrate, we ask in return--How can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects which
have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> for their substrate, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> are different from the thing,

(viz. difference and non-difference)? And much less even are they able
to do so if they are viewed as non-different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which is
their substrate. If, moreover, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aspects on the one hand, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in which they inhere on the other, be admitted to be distinct
entities, there will be required a further factor to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about their
difference and non-difference, and we shall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be led into a _regressus

its generic character bears the character of unity, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
the admittedly uniform idea of an individual; for wherever a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> expresses itself in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> 'this is such and such' it
implies the distinction of an attribute or mode, and that to which the
attribute or mode belongs. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under discussion the genus
constitutes the mode, and the individual that to which the mode belongs:
the idea does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> possess the character of unity.

For these very reasons the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> cannot stand to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in
the bhedâbheda-relation. And as the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of non-difference is founded on
Scripture, we assume that the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference rests on beginningless
Nescience.--But on this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> want of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and all the imperfections

to be unreal. On your <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> on the other hand, which admits nothing but

Here the following explanation may possibly be attempted. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

into the condition of individual soul, and there remains no non-

altogether different from Brahman, and the difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from

alternative means the embracing of the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the Kârvâka (who makes no

that on the strength of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring non-difference we must admit
that all difference is based on Nescience only. Hence, Scripture being
an authoritative instrument of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in so far only as it has for
its end action and the cessation of action, the Vedânta-texts must be
allowed to be a valid means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with regard to Brahman's nature,
in so far as they stand in a supplementary relation to the injunctions
of meditation.

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is finally combated by the Mîmâmsaka. Even if, he says, we
allow the Vedânta-texts to have a purport in so far as they are
supplementary to injunctions of meditation, they cannot be viewed as
valid means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with regard to Brahman. Do the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> referring
to Brahman, we ask, occupy the position of valid means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in

<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> are separate independent sentences, they cannot have

instructive power. Nor must it be said that <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is a kind of
continued remembrance, and as such requires to be defined by the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>

to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> they convey. For the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the
demand on the part of an injunction of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> for an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be
remembered may be satisfied even by something unreal (not true), as in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of injunctions such as 'Let him meditate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as Brahman'

prompting to action or the cessation of action; as, even on the
supposition of their being supplementary to injunctions of meditation,
the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> they effect is to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of

they accomplish the end of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (i.e. please, gratify) by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

reality of an accomplished thing, and hence Scripture cannot be viewed
as a valid means for the cognition of Brahman.

To this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtrakâra replies, 'But this on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of

'connexion with the end of man.' That Brahman, which is measureless
bliss and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> end of man, is connected

a youth of royal descent is of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> because he does not belong to a
community of low wretches living on the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of dogs!

The relation of the different <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> is as follows. There are individual
souls of numberless kinds-gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyâdharas,
Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Yakshas, Râkshasas, Pisâkas, men, beasts, birds,
creeping animals, trees, bushes, creepers, grasses and so on--

Scripture (i.e. the Pradhâna) is not (what is taught by the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>

We have maintained that what is taught by the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> relative to the
origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is Brahman, omniscient, and so on. The present

refer to the Pradhâna and similar entities which rest on Inference only.

We read in the Chândogya, 'Being only was this in the beginning, one

The Pûrvapakshin maintains that the Pradhâna is meant. For he says, the
Chândogya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted expresses the causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of what is denoted by

Goodness, Passion and Darkness, and forming the sphere of fruition of
intelligent beings. By the 'effected' <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> we understand the assuming,
on the part of the causal substance, of a different condition; whatever
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> constitutes the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in its effected
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the same constitutes its essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in the causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> also.
Now the effect, in our case, is made up of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> elements Goodness,
Passion and Darkness; hence the cause is the Pradhâna which consists in
an equipoise of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> elements. And as in this Pradhâna all
distinctions are merged, so that it is pure Being, the Chândogya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

That which
does not rest on Scripture, i.e. the Pradhâna, which rests on Inference
only, is not what is intimated by the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> referring to the origination
of the world; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> exhibits the root 'îksh'--which means 'to
think'--as denoting a special activity on the part of what is termed
'Being.' 'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth.' 'Thinking'
cannot possibly belong to the non-sentient Pradhâna: the term 'Being'
can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> denote only the all-knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is capable

refer to creation, the act of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is stated to be preceded by
thought. 'He thought, shall I send forth worlds. He sent forth these
worlds' (Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 2); 'He <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> he sent forth Prâna' (Pr. Up.
VI, 3); and others.--But it is a rule that as a cause we must assume

Person) will be established under Sû. II, 1, 4. The present Sûtra
declares that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> treating of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> cannot refer to the
Pradhâna; the Sûtra just mentioned will dispose of objections. Nor is
the Pûrvapakshin right in maintaining that the Chândogya <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of an Inference; for it does not <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (hetu--which
is the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in an Inference). The illustrative instance (of
the lump of clay) is introduced merely in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to convince him who
considers it impossible that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> should be known through one
thing--as maintained in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'through which that is <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> which
was not heard,' &c.,--that this _is_ possible after all. And the mention
made in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of 'seeing' clearly shows that there is absolutely no
intention of setting forth an Inference.

Let us assume, then, the Pûrvapakshin resumes, that the 'seeing' of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> denotes not 'seeing' in its primary, direct sense--such as belongs
to intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> only; but 'seeing' in a secondary, figurative
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> which there is ascribed to the Pradhâna in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in
passages immediately following it is ascribed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and water--'the

Up. VI, 2, 3). The transference, to non-
existent things, of attributes properly belonging to sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is
quite common; as when we say 'the rice-fields look out for rain'; 'the
rain delighted the seeds.'--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the next Sûtra.




6. If it be said that (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'seeing') has a secondary (figurative)
meaning; we deny this, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Self' (being applied to
the cause of the world).

The contention that, because, in passages standing close by, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'seeing' is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in a secondary sense, the 'seeing' predicated of the
Sat ('Being') is also to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in a secondary sense, viz. as denoting
(not real <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> but) a certain condition previous to creation, cannot
be upheld; for in other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> met with in the same section (viz. 'All
this has that for its Self; that is the True, that is the Self', Ch. Up.
VI, 8, 7), that which first had been spoken of as Sat is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
'Self'. The designation 'Self' which in this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is applied to the
Sat in its relation to the entire world, sentient or non-sentient, is in
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> appropriate to the Pradhâna. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that, as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is the Self of fire, water, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> also, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> fire,
&c. (in the passages stating that fire, &c. thought) denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self only. This conclusion agrees with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Let me enter into these

the proper sense, and the hypothesis that, owing to its connexion with
these latter texts, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> predicated of 'Being' ('it thought,' &c.
) should be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in a figurative <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lapses altogether.




The next following Sûtra confirms the same view.

7. Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on it.

Svetaketu, who is desirous of final release, is at first--by means of
the clause 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that'--instructed to meditate on himself as having
his Self in that which truly is; and thereupon the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'for him
there is delay' only as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as 'I shall not be released, then I shall
be united' teaches that for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> taking his stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> that teaching
there will be Release, i.e. union with Brahman--which is delayed only
until this mortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> falls away. If, on the other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
teach that the non-intelligent Pradhâna is the general cause, it could
not possibly teach that <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on this Pradhâna being a man's Self

according to the scriptural saying, 'According as his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is in this
world, so will he be when he has departed this life' (Ch. Up. III, 14,
1). And Scripture, which is more loving than even a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> parents,
cannot possibly teach such union with the Non-sentient, which is
acknowledged to be the cause of all the assaults of suffering in its
threefold form. Moreover, those who hold the theory of the Pradhâna
being the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> do not themselves maintain that he who
takes his stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Pradhâna attains final release.




The Pradhâna is not the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for the following <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also:

8. And because there is no statement of its having to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside.

If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Sat' denoted the Pradhâna as the cause of the world, we
should expect the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> to teach that the idea of having his Self in that
'Sat' should be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by Svetaketu as desirous of Release; for that
idea <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be contrary to Release. So far from teaching this, the text,
however, directly inculcates that notion in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that.'--
The next Sûtra adds a further reason.

The Pradhâna's being the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply a contradiction
of the initial statement, viz. that through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>

of cause and effect, this initial statement can only be fulfilled in

there is known the entire world, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> sentient or non-sentient, which
constitutes the effect. But if the Pradhâna were the cause, the
aggregate of sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> could not be known through it--for sentient
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are not the effect of a non-sentient principle, and there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

or being merged or reabsorbed in, the Self. By reabsorption we
understand something being merged in its cause. Now the non-intelligent
Pradhâna cannot be the cause of the intelligent soul; hence the soul's
going to its Self can only mean its going to _the_, i.e. the universal,
Self. The term 'individual soul' (jîva) denotes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so far as

'In the beginning the Self was all this; there was nothing else
whatsoever thinking. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent
forth these worlds' (Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 1); 'From that Self sprang ether,
from ether air, from air fire, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> water, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> earth' (Taitt.

all-knowing, all-powerful, all-embracing; is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all evil, &c.;
realises all its wishes and purposes. 'Let me, entering those <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>

these creatures have their root in the Sat, they dwell in the Sat, they
rest in the Sat' (VI, 8, 4); 'All this has that for its Self; it is the
True, it is the Self (VI, 8, 7); 'Whatever there is of him here in the
world, and whatever is not, all that is contained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it' (VIII, 1,

other scriptural texts, 'Of him there is no <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> in the world, no

establishing the Pradhâna. Hence it remains a settled conclusion that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, Nârâyana, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shadow of imperfection, &c.,

these Sûtras point out as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of enquiry.

For the same reasons the theory of a Brahman, which is nothing but non-
differenced intelligence, must also be considered as refuted by the
Sûtrakâra, with the help of the scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> quoted; for those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
prove that the Brahman, which forms the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of enquiry, possesses
attributes such as thinking, and so on, in their real literal sense. On
the theory, on the other hand, of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that is nothing but

of potentiality, it is clear that you abandon your entire theory of a

authority of Scripture, that the universal substance possesses this one
distinguishing attribute of self-luminousness.--Well, in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> you
must of course admit, on the same authority, all those other qualities
also which Scripture vouches for, such as all-knowingness, the
possession of all powers, and so on.--Moreover, potentiality means
capability to produce certain special effects, and hence can be
determined on the ground of those special effects only. But if there are
no means of knowing these particular effects, there are also no means of
cognising potentiality.--And those who hold the theory of a substance
devoid of all difference, have not even means of proof for their
substance; for as we have shown before, Perception, Inference, Scripture,

Here terminates the adhikarana of 'seeing'.

So far the Sûtras have declared that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which forms the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of enquiry is different from the non-intelligent Pradhâna, which is
merely an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of fruition for intelligent beings. They now proceed to
show that Brahman--which is antagonistic to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and constituted by

sufferings, springing from the soul's contact with Prakriti (Pradhâna).




13. The Self consisting of Bliss (is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
multiplication.

We read in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Taittirîyas, 'Different from this Self, which
consists of Understanding, is the other inner Self which consists of
bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 5).--Here the doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Self
consisting of bliss be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, which is different from the
inner Self subject to bondage and release, and termed 'jîva.' (i.e.
living self or individual soul), or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it be that very inner Self,
i.e. the jîva.--It _is_ that inner Self, the Pûrvapakshin contends. For
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says 'of that this, i.e. the Self consisting of bliss, is the
sârîra Self'; and sârîra means that which is joined to a body, in other
words, the so-called jîva.--But, an objection is raised, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
enumerates the different Selfs, beginning with the Self consisting of
bliss, to the end that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may obtain the bliss of Brahman, which was,
at the outset, stated to be the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (II, 1), and in the
end teaches that the Self consisting of bliss is the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
(II, 6). And that the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is the all-knowing Lord, since
Scripture says of him that 'he thought,' we have already explained.--
That cause of the world, the Pûrvapakshin rejoins, is not different from
the jîva; for in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Chândogyas that Being which first is
described as the creator of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is exhibited, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> passages, in
co-ordination with the jîva ('having entered into them with that living
Self' and 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that, O Svetaketu'). And the purport of co-
ordination is to express oneness of being, as when we say, 'This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
here is that Devadatta we knew before.' And <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> preceded by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>

Self consisting of bliss, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have continued, 'Different from
this Self consisting of bliss is the other inner Self--Brahman.' But
there is no such continuation. The connexion of the different clauses
stands as follows: After <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> has been introduced as the topic of the

innermost Self of all, enumerates the pranamaya and so on--designating
them in succession as more and more inward Selfs--, and finally leads up
to the ânandamaya as the innermost Self('Different from this, &c., is the
Self consisting of bliss'). From all which it appears that the term
'Self' up to the end denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> mentioned at the beginning.--
But, in immediate continuation of the clause, 'Brahman is the tail, the
support,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> exhibits the following sloka: 'Non-existing becomes

we know as himself existing.' Here the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> and non-existence of
the Self are declared to depend on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and non-knowledge of
Brahman, not of the Self consisting of bliss. Now no doubt can possibly
arise as to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> or non-existence of this latter Self, which,
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of joy, satisfaction, &c., is known to every one. Hence the
sloka cannot refer to that Self, and hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is different from
that Self.--This objection, the Pûrvapakshin rejoins, is unfounded. In
the earlier parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> we have corresponding slokas, each of
them following on a preceding clause that refers to the tail or support
of a particular Self: in the case, e.g. of the Self consisting of food,
we read, 'This is the tail, the support,' and then comes the sloka,
'From <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> are produced all creatures,' &c. Now it is evident that all
these slokas are meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth not only what had been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'tail,'
but the entire Self concerned (Self of food, Self of breath, &c.); and
from this it follows that also the sloka, 'Non-existing becomes he,'
does not refer to the 'tail' only as something other than the Self of
bliss, but to the entire Self of bliss. And there may very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be a

its being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of limitless bliss. And should it be said that

i.e. the Self of bliss as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all pain. To <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or the

pain and grief that which in a preceding clause ('The True, knowledge,
the Infinite is Brahman') had already been separated from all changeful
material things. As applied to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (or the Self), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is
nothing but absolute bliss, the term 'ânandamaya' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> has to be

means prâna.

The outcome of all this is that the term 'ânandamaya' denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
essential nature--which is nothing but absolute uniform bliss--of the
jiva that appears as distinguished by all the manifold individualising
forms which are the figments of Nescience. The Self of bliss is the jîva
or pratyag-âtman, i.e. the individual soul.

Against this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtrakâra contends that the Self
consisting of bliss is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of multiplication.'--
The section which begins with the words,'This is an examination of bliss,'
and terminates with the sloka, 'from whence all speech turns back'
(Taitt. Up. II, 8), arrives at bliss, supreme and not to be surpassed,
by successively multiplying inferior stages of bliss by a hundred; now
such supreme bliss cannot possibly belong to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which
enjoys only a small share of very limited happiness, mixed with endless
pain and grief; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> clearly indicates, as its abode, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, which differs from all other Selfs in so far as being
radically opposed to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and of an unmixed <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> nature. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
says, 'Different from this Self consisting of understanding (vijñâna)
there is the inner Self consisting of bliss'. Now that which consists of
understanding (vijñâna) is the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (jîva), not the internal
organ (buddhi) only; for the formative element, 'maya,' ('consisting of';
in vijñânamaya) indicates a difference (between vijñâna and vijñânamaya).
The term 'prâna-maya' ('consisting of breath') we explain to mean
'prâna' only, because no other explanation is possible; but as
vijñânamaya may be explained as,--jîva, we have no right to neglect
'maya' as unmeaning. And this interpretation is quite suitable, as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the states of bondage and release alike is a 'knowing' subject.
That moreover even in 'prânamaya', and so on, the affix 'maya' may be
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as having a <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> will be shown further on.--But how is it then
that in the sloka which refers to the vijñânamaya, 'Understanding
(vijñâna) performs the sacrifice', the term 'vijñâna' only is used?--The
essential nature, we reply, of the knowing subject is suitably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
'knowledge', and this term is transferred to the knowing subject itself
which is defined as possessing that nature. For we generally see that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> which denote attributes defining the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
also convey the notion of the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself. This
also accounts for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the sloka ('Vijñâna performs the
sacrifice, it performs all sacred acts') speaks of vijñâna as being the
agent in sacrifices and so on; the buddhi alone could not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an
agent. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not ascribe agency to the other
Selfs (the prânamaya and so on) which are mentioned before the
vijñânamaya; for they are non-intelligent instruments of intelligence,
and the latter only can be an agent. With the same <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> further
on (II, 6), distinguishing the intelligent and the non-intelligent by
means of their different characteristic attributes, says in the end
'knowledge and non-knowledge,' <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> thereby that which possesses the
attribute of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and that which does not. An analogous <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is met
with in the so-called antaryâmi-brâhmana (Bri. Up. III. 7). There the
Kânvas read, 'He who dwells in knowledge' (vijñâna; III, 7, 16), but
instead of this the Mâdhyandinas read 'he who dwells in the Self,' and
so make clear that what the Kânvas designate as 'knowledge' really is
the knowing Self.--That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> vijñâna, although denoting the knowing
Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> has a neuter termination, is meant to denote it as something
substantial. We hence conclude that he who is different from the Self
consisting of knowledge, i.e. the individual Self, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
which consists of bliss.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> indeed that the sloka, 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice,
'directly mentions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only, not the knowing Self; all the same we
have to understand that what is meant is the latter, who is referred to
in the clause, 'different from this is the inner Self which consists of
knowledge.' This conclusion is supported by the sloka referring to the
Self which consists of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> (II, 2); for that sloka refers to <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> only,
'From <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> are produced all creatures,' &c., all the same the preceding

but to an effect of it which consists of food. Considering all this the
Sûtrakâra himself in a subsequent Sûtra (I, 1, 18) bases his <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> on the

assertion, made by the Pûrvapakshin, that the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not

with this living Self,' 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that'); and that hence the
introductory clause of the Taitt. <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> ('He who knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> cannot be upheld; for although the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is

infinite and wonderful Universe--a process described in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as
'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth.--It sent forth fire,' &c.
That even the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is unequal to such 'world business' as

Brahman, the cause of the world, is identical with the individual soul,
how then do you <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the co-ordination in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> appear in

&c., be one with the individual soul, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> activities--whether it be

mean to be unreal? Brahman's connexion with what is evil?--or its
essential nature, owing to which it is absolutely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and antagonistic
to all evil?--You will perhaps reply that, owing to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of Brahman,
which is absolutely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and antagonistic to all evil, being the
substrate of beginningless Nescience, there presents itself the false
appearance of its being connected with evil. But there you maintain what
is contradictory. On the one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> there is Brahman's absolute perfection
and antagonism to all evil; on the other it is the substrate of
Nescience, and thereby the substrate of a false appearance which is
involved in endless pain; for to be connected with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> means to be the
substrate of Nescience and the appearance of suffering which is produced
thereby. Now it is a contradiction to say that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is connected with

to say that there is no real contradiction because that appearance is
something false. For whatever is false belongs to that group of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
contrary to man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> interest, for the destruction of which the
Vedânta-texts are studied. To be connected with what is hurtful to man,
and to be absolutely perfect and antagonistic to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is self-
contradictory.--But, our adversary now rejoins, what after all are we to
do? The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> at first clearly promises that through the cognition
of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> everything will be known ('by which that which is not <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>
_is_ heard,' &c., Ch. Up. VI, 1, 3); thereupon declares that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
the sole cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> ('Being only this was in the beginning'),

intentions ('it thought, may I be many'); and then finally, by means of
the co-ordination, 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that' intimates that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is one with

substrate of Nescience and all that springs from it!--Not even for the
purpose, we reply, of making <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of Scripture may we assume what in
itself is senseless and contradictory!--Let us then say that Brahman's
connexion with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is real, and its absolute perfection unreal!--
Scripture, we reply, aims at comforting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> afflicted by the
assaults of threefold pain, and now, according to you, it teaches that
the assaults of suffering are real, while its essential perfection and
happiness are unreal figments, due to error! This is excellent comfort
indeed!--To avoid these difficulties let us then assume that both
aspects of Brahman--viz. on the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> its entering into the
distressful condition of individual souls other than non-differenced
intelligence, and on the other its being the cause of the world, endowed
with all perfections, &c.--are alike unreal!--Well, we reply, we do not
exactly admire the depth of your insight into the connected <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of

The promise that through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> everything
will be known can certainly not be fulfilled if everything is false, for
in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there exists nothing that could be known. In so far as the
cognition of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> has something real for its object, and the
cognition of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is of the same kind, and moreover is comprised
in the cognition of one thing; in so far it can be said that everything
is known through one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> being known. Through the cognition of the
real shell we do not cognise the unreal silver of which the shell is the
substrate.--Well, our adversary resumes, let it then be said that the

everything is to be known is that only non-differenced Being is real,
while everything else is unreal.--If this were so, we rejoin, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

'known as false') 'the non-heard is heard,' &c. Moreover, if the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

Against this the Pûrvapakshin now may argue as follows. Several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>

the intention of expressing the unity of one thing, and hence do not aim
at expressing a duality of attributes, viz. the quality of blueness and

near place; what it means to express is only that there is oneness on
the part of a personal substance--which substance is characterised by

And as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> our explanation cannot be charged

All this, we rejoin, is unfounded. What the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in all sentences
whatsoever aim at conveying is only a particular connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
known to be denoted by those words. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Words</span> such as 'blue,' standing in co-
ordination with others, express that some <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> possessing the
attribute of blueness, &c., as known from the ordinary <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of language,
is connected with some other matter. When, e.g., somebody says 'bring
the blue lotus,' a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> which possesses the attribute of
blueness. And when we are told that 'a herd of elephants excited with
passion lives in the Vindhya-forest,' we again understand that what is
meant is something possessing several attributes denoted by several
words. Analogously we have to understand, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> intimated by
Vedânta-texts in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of coordination, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as possessing such
and such attributes.--It is an error to assume that, where a sentence
aims at setting forth attributes, one attribute is to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as
qualifying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in so far as qualified by another attribute; the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> rather is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself is equally qualified by all
attributes. For co-ordination means the application, to one thing, of
several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> having different reasons of application; and the effect of
co-ordination is that one and the same thing, because being connected--
positively or negatively--with some attribute other than that which is
conveyed by one word, is also known through other words. As e.g. when it
is said that 'Devadatta (is) dark-complexioned, young, reddish-eyed, not
stupid, not poor, of irreproachable character.' Where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> co-ordinate

one of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> is to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in a secondary sense, while the
other retains its primary meaning, as e.g. in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the sentence,
'The Vâhîka <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is an ox.' But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the 'blue lotus' and the
like, where there is nothing contradictory in the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

make the following remark. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in so far as defined by its
correlation to some one attribute is something different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
in so far as defined by its correlation to some <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> attribute; hence,
even if there is equality of <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> affixes (as in 'nîlam utpalam'), the

therefore, express the oneness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> qualified by several
attributes; not any more than the juxtaposition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as

attributes which are not capable of being combined in one thing. Such
incapability is, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the generic character of a jar and that
of a piece of cloth, proved by other means of knowledge; but there is no

merely to suggest the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself, one attribute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> suffice for such

of 'implication' in the judgment, 'This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is that Devadatta'; for
there is absolutely no contradiction between the past Devadatta, who was
connected with some distant place, and the present Devadatta, who is

correlative moments of time. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> hold to the conclusion that co-

attributes.

For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the Vedic passage, 'He buys the Soma by means of a
cow one year old, of a tawny colour, with reddish-brown eyes' (arunayâ,
ekahâyanyâ, piñgâkshyâ), must be understood to enjoin that the purchase
is to be effected by means of a cow one year old, possessing the
attributes of tawny colour, &c. This point is discussed Pû. Mî. Sû. III,
1, 12.--The Pûrvapakshin there argues as follows: We admit that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'arunayâ' ('by means of a tawny one') denotes the quality of tawniness
inclusive of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> possessing that quality; for qualities as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
generic character exist only in so far as being modes of substances. But
it is not possible to restrict tawny colour to connexion with a cow one
year old, for the injunction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result

construed as----) 'He buys by means of a cow one year old, and that a
red one' is not permissible [FOOTNOTE 222:1]. We must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> break up
the sentence into two, one of which is constituted by the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>

the substances enjoined in that section (as instrumental towards the end
of the sacrifice). And the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the feminine case-termination of the

the things, of whatever gender, which are enjoined in that section.
Tawniness must not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be restricted to the cow one year old only.--
Of this pûrvapaksha the Sûtra disposes in the following words: 'There
being oneness of sense, and hence connexion of substance and quality
with one action, there is restriction.'--The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
'arunayâ' and 'ekahâyanyâ'--which denote a substance, viz. a cow one
year old, distinguished by the quality of possessing tawny colour--stand
in co-ordination establishes that they have one sense; and is the
substance, viz. the cow, and the quality, viz. tawny colour--which the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'arunayâ' denotes as standing in the relation of distinguishing
attribute and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished thereby--can thus, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any

the Soma', tawny colour is restricted to the cow one year old which is
instrumental with regard to the purchase. If the connexion of tawniness
with the action of buying were to be determined from syntactical
connexion--in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as there is made out the connexion of the cow
one year old with that action--then the injunctory sentence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> indeed

But such is not
the case; for the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'arunyâ' denotes a substance characterised by
the quality of tawniness, and the co-ordination in which 'arunayâ'
stands to 'ekahâyanyâ' makes us apprehend merely that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
characterised by tawniness also is one year old, but does not make a
special statement as to the connexion of that quality with the thing.
For the purport of co-ordination is the unity of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished
by attributes; according to the definition that the application to one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> of several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> possessing different reasons of application,
constitutes co-ordination. For the same reason, the syntactical unity
(ekavâkyatvam) of sentences such as 'the cloth is red' follows from all
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> referring to one thing. The function of the syntactical
collocation is to express the connexion of the cloth with the action of
being; the connexion of the red colour (with the cloth) on the other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> is denoted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'red' only. And what is ascertained from co-
ordination (sâmânâdhikaranya) is only that the cloth is a substance to
which a certain colour belongs. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> may, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any
contradiction, be conceived as follows. Several words--having either the
affixes of the oblique cases or that of the nominative case--which
denote one or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or several qualities, present to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the idea of
that which is characterised by those qualities, and their co-ordination
intimates that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> characterised by all those attributes is one
only; and the entire sentence finally expresses the connexion in which
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> with its attributes stands to the action denoted by the verb.
This may be illustrated by various sentences exhibiting the co-
ordination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> possessing different case-endings, as e.g. 'There

apposition to Devadatta have the nominative termination); 'Let him make
a stage curtain by means of a white cloth' (where 'white' and 'cloth'
have instrumental case-endings), &c. &c. We may further illustrate the
entire relation of co-ordinated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the action by means of the
following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> examples: 'Let him boil rice in the cooking-pot by means

distinguished by its connexion with several things. If we now consider
the following amplified sentence, 'Let a skilful cook prepare, in a
vessel of even shape, boiled rice mixed with milk, by means of sticks of
dry khâdira wood,' we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> connected with the action is
denoted by an aggregate of co-ordinated words; but as soon as each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
is apprehended, it is at one and the same moment conceived as something
distinguished by several attributes, and as such connects itself with
the action expressed by the verb. In all this there is no contradiction
whatever.--We must further <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to the assertion that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> denoting
a quality which stands in a sentence that has already mentioned a
substance denotes the quality only (exclusive of the substance so
qualified), and that hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'arunayâ' also denotes a quality
only. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that neither in ordinary nor in Vedic language we ever
meet with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> which--denoting a quality and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> standing

quality. Nor is it correct to say that a quality-word occurring in a
sentence which has already mentioned a substance denotes a mere quality:
for in a sentence such as 'the cloth (is) white,' where a substance is
mentioned in the first place, the quality-word clearly denotes (not mere
whiteness but) something which possesses the quality of whiteness. When,
on the other hand, we have a collocation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as 'patasya
suklah' ('of the cloth'--gen.; 'white' nom.), the idea of a cloth
distinguished by whiteness does not arise; but this is due not to the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the substance being mentioned first, but to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

contention that, as the buying of the Soma is exclusively concluded by
the cow one year old (as instrumental in the purchase), the quality of
tawniness (denoted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'arunayâ') cannot connect itself with the
action expressed by the verb; for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that denotes a quality and

expressed by the verb. And since, as shown, the quality of tawniness
connects itself with its substance (the cow) on the mere basis of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the words, it is wrong (on the part of the Pûrvapakshin to
abandon this natural connexion and) to establish their connexion on the
ground of their being otherwise incapable of serving as means of the
purchase.

All this confirms our contention, viz. that the co-ordination of 'thou'
and 'that' must be understood to express oneness, without, at the same
time, there being given up the different attributes denoted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

the element apprehended as 'such' is what constitutes a mode; now as
this element is relative to the thing, the idea of it is also relative
to the thing, and finds its accomplishment in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> only; hence the

(not merely 'implied') one.

But, an objection is raised, we indeed observe that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting

'the ox is short-horned,' 'the sugar is white'; but where substances
appear as the modes of other substances we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that formative affixes
are used, 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is dandin, kundalin' (bearing a stick; wearing
earrings).--This is not so, we reply. There is nothing to single out
either species, or quality, or substance, as what determines co-
ordination: co-ordination disregards such limitations. Whenever a _thing_
(whether species, or quality, or substance) has <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> as a _mode_
only--owing to its proof, <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> and conception being inseparably
connected with something else--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting it, as they designate

hand, a substance which is established in separation from other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

The individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> connected with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

either with the subject-matter of the section, or with scripture in
general; and not a shadow of imperfection such as Nescience, and so on,
attaches to Brahman, the blameless, the absolutely blessed. The co-
ordination with the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> proves only the difference of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> from the soul, which is a mere mode of Brahman; and hence we
hold that different from the Self consisting of knowledge, i.e. the
individual soul, is the Self consisting of bliss, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.

Nor is there any force in the objection that as the Self of bliss is
said to be 'sârira,' i.e. embodied-viz. in the clause 'of him the
embodied Self is the same' (Taitt. Up. II, 5, 6)--it cannot be different
from the individual soul. For throughout this section the recurring
clause 'of him the embodied Self is the same as of the preceding one,'
refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, calling that the 'embodied' one. The clause
'From that same Self sprang ether' (II, 1) designates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman-which is different from the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and is introduced as
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> cause of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> created--as the 'Self'; whence we
conclude that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> different from it--from ether up to the Self of
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> constitute its body. The Subâla-upanishad moreover states quite
directly that all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self: 'He of
whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the body, of whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is the body, of whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> is
the body, of whom wind is the body, of whom ether is the body, of whom
the Imperishable is the body, of whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Death</span> is the body, he the inner
Self of all, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> one, the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Nârâyana.' From this it follows
that what constitutes the embodied Self of the Self of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is nothing
else but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self referred to in the clause 'From that same Self
sprang ether.' When, then, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> further on says with regard to the
Self of breath, 'of him the embodied Self is the same as of the
preceding one' (II, 3), the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> can only be that what constitutes
the embodied Self of the 'preceding' Self of food, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
which is the universal cause, is also the embodied Self of the Self
consisting of breath. The same reasoning holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to the
Self consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the Self consisting of knowledge. In the
case, finally, of the Self consisting of bliss, the expression 'the
same' (esha eva) is meant to convey that that Self has its Self in
nothing different from itself. For when, after having understood that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is the embodied Self of the vijñânamaya also, we are
told that the embodied Self of that vijñânamaya is also the embodied
Self of the ânandamaya, we understand that of the ânandamaya--which we
know to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self on the ground of 'multiplication'--its own
Self is the Self. The final purport of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is that
everything different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of intelligent or
non-intelligent nature, constitutes its body, while that Self alone is
the non-conditioned embodied Self. For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> competent
persons designate this doctrine which has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for its
subject-matter as the 'sârîraka,' i. e. the doctrine of the 'embodied'
Self.--We have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arrived at the conclusion that the Self of bliss is
something different from the individual Self, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.

Here the Pûrvapakshin raises the following objection.--The Self
consisting of bliss (ânandamaya) is not something different from the
individual soul, because the formative element--maya denotes something

we know from Pânini IV, 3, 144.--But according to Pâ. V, 4, 21,--maya
has also the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'abounding in'; as when we say 'the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is
annamaya,' i.e. abounds in food. And this may be its <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> in
'ânandamaya' also!--Not so, the Pûrvapakshin replies. In 'annamaya,' in
an earlier part of the chapter,--maya has the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'made of',
'consisting of'; and for the sake of consistency, we must hence ascribe
the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> to it in 'ânandamaya.' And even if, in the latter word,
it denoted abundance, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not prove that the ânandamaya is other
than the individual soul. For if we say that a Self 'abounds' in bliss,
this implies that with all this bliss there is mixed some small part of
pain; and to be 'mixed with pain' is what constitutes the character of
the individual soul. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> proper to assume, in agreement with
its previous use, that 'ânandamaya' means 'consisting of bliss.' In
ordinary speech as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in Vedic language (cp. common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as
'mrinmaya,' 'hiranmaya'; and Vedic clauses such as 'parnamayijuhûh')
-maya as a rule means 'consisting of,' and this <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> hence presents
itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> first. And the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> _may_ be denoted as
'made of bliss'; for in itself it is of the essence of bliss, and its

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that, owing to the received <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of -maya, the
ânandamaya is none other than the individual soul.--To this primâ facie
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra refers and refutes it.

14. If, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> denoting an effect, (ânandamaya
be said) not (to denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self); (we say) no, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
abundance.

We deny the conclusion of the Pûrvapakshin, on the ground of there being
abundance of bliss in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, and 'abundance' being one of
the possible meanings of -maya.--Since bliss such as described in the
Taitt. Up.--bliss which is reached by successively multiplying by
hundred all inferior kinds of bliss--cannot belong to the individual
soul, we conclude that it belongs to Brahman; and as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be
an effect, and as -maya, may have the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'abounding in,' we
conclude that the ânandamaya is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself; inner contradiction
obliging us to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of -maya which is recommended by
regard to 'consequence' and frequency of usage. The regard for
consistency, moreover, already has to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
'prânamaya'; for in that term -maya cannot denote 'made of.' The
'prânamaya' Self can only be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by that name in so far as air with
its five modifications has (among others) the modification <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prâna,
i.e. breathing out, or because among the five modifications or functions
of air prâna is the 'abounding,' i.e. prevailing one.--Nor can it be
truly said that -maya is but rarely <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'abounding in':
expressions such as 'a <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> abounding in food' (annamaya), 'a
procession with many carriages' (sakatamayî), are by no means uncommon.--
Nor can we admit that to <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> something 'abounding in bliss' implies the
presence of _some_ pain. For 'abundance' precludes paucity on the part
of that which is said to abound, but does not imply the presence of what
is contrary. The presence or absence of what is contrary has to be
ascertained by other means of proof; and in our <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> we do ascertain the
absence of what is contrary to bliss by such means, viz. the clause
'free from evil,' &c. Abundance of bliss on the part of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
certainly implies a relation to paucity on the part of some other bliss;
and in accordance with this demand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says 'That is one measure of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> bliss,' &c. (II, 8, 1). The bliss of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is of measureless
abundance, compared to the bliss of the individual soul.--Nor can it be
maintained that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may be viewed as being an effect of
bliss. For that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and bliss

made into a pot, is an assumption contradicted by all scripture, sacred
tradition, and reasoning. That in the Samsâra <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the soul's bliss and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> are contracted owing to karman will be shown later on.--The
Self of bliss <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is other than the individual soul; it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
itself.

A further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for this conclusion is supplied by the next Sûtra.




15. And because he is declared to be the cause of thatra.

'For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that bliss existed
not in the ether? He alone causes bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). This means--
He alone is the cause of bliss on the part of the individual souls.--
Some one is here designated as the cause of bliss enjoyed by the souls;
and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> conclude that the causer of bliss, who must be other than
the souls to which bliss is imparted, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self abounding in
bliss.

In the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> quoted the term 'bliss' denotes him who abounds in bliss,
as will be shown later on.--A further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> is given in the next Sûtra.




16. And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the mantra is
declared (to be the ânandamaya).

That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is described in the mantra, 'True Being, knowledge,
infinite is Biahman,' is proclaimed as the Self abounding in bliss. And
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, other than the individual soul; for
the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'He who knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> attains the Highest' refers to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
as something to be obtained by the individual soul, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'On
this the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is recorded' show that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is related to
that same Brahman. The mantra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is meant to render clear the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
of the Brâhmana passage. Now the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be reached by the meditating
Devotee must be something different from him. The same point is rendered
clear by all the following Brâhmana passages and mantras: 'from that
same Self sprang ether,' and so on. The Self abounding in bliss
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is other than the individual soul.

Here an opponent argues as follows:--We indeed must acknowledge that the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be reached is something different from the meditating Devotee;
but the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> described in the mantra does not
substantially differ from the individual soul; that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is nothing
but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the Devotee in its pure state, consisting of mere non-
differenced intelligence, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shade of Nescience. To this pure
condition it is reduced in the mantra describing it as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Being,
knowledge, infinite. A subsequent passage, 'that from which all speech,
with the mind, turns away, unable to reach it' (II. 9), expresses this
same <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of non-differentiation, describing it as lying beyond <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
and speech. It is this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to which the mantra refers, and the
Self of bliss is identical with it.--To this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra replies.

The other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, i.e. the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> jîva, even in the

(such as is, in the mantra, ascribed to Brahman; cp. the term
'vipaskitâ') cannot belong. Unconditioned <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is illustrated by

conditioned intelligence. And if the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is viewed as being
mere non-differenced intelligence, it does not possess the capacity of
seeing different things, and hence cannot of course possess vipaskittva
in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> stated above. That, however, the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a substance
devoid of all difference cannot be proved by any means of knowledge, we
have already shown before. Again, if the clause 'from whence speech
returns,' &c., were meant to express that speech and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> return from
Brahman, this could not mean that the Real is devoid of all difference,
but only that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and speech are not means for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.
And from this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something altogether empty,
futile. Let us examine the context. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section, beginning with
'He who knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches Brahman,' declares that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is all-
knowing, the cause of the world, consisting of pure bliss, the cause of
bliss in others; that through its mere wish it creates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
universe comprising <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and souls; that entering into the universe of
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> it constitutes their Self; that it is the cause of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span>
and fearlessness; that it rules Vâyu Âditya and other <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings;
that its bliss is ever so much superior to all other bliss; and many
other points. Now, all at once, the clause 'from whence speech returns'
is said to mean that neither speech nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> applies to Brahman, and
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there are no means whatever of knowing Brahman! This is idle
talk indeed! In the clause '(that) from which speech returns,' the
relative pronoun 'from which' denotes bliss; this bliss is again
explicitly referred to in the clause 'knowing the bliss of Brahman'--the
genitive 'of Brahman' intimating that the bliss belongs to Brahman; what
then could be the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of this clause which distinctly speaks of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> had at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to be conceived as
transcending all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech? What the clause really means rather
is that if one undertakes to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the definite amount of the bliss of
Brahman--the superabundance of which is illustrated by the successive
multiplications with hundred--mind and speech have to turn back
powerless, since no such definite amount can be assigned. He who knows
the bliss of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as not to be defined by any definite amount, does
not <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> anything.--That, moreover, the all-wise being referred to in
the mantra is other than the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of release, is
rendered perfectly clear by what--in passages such as 'it desired,' &c.--
is said about its effecting, through its mere volition, the origination
and subsistence of the world, its being the inner Self of the world, and
so on.




18. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the declaration of difference.

The part of the chapter--beginning with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'From that same Self
there sprang ether'--which sets forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> referred
to in the mantra, declares its difference from the individual soul, no
less than from the Selfs consisting of food, breath, and mind, viz. in
the clause 'different from this which consists of knowledge, is the
other inner Self which consists of bliss.'--Through this declaration of
difference from the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> we know that the Self of bliss
referred to in the mantra is other than the individual soul.




19. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred (i.
e. matter).

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is enthralled by Nescience may
operate as the cause of the world, it must needs be connected with non-
sentient matter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by such names as pradhâna, or ânumânika (that
which is inferred). For such is the condition for the creative energy of
Brahmâ and similar beings. Our text, on the other hand, teaches that the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the aggregate of sentient and non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> results
from the mere wish of a being <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all connexion with non-sentient
matter, 'He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth;' 'He sent forth
all, whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> understand that that
Self of bliss which sends forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> does not require connexion
with non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ânumânika, and hence conclude that it is
other than the individual soul.--A further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> is stated in the next
Sûtra.




20. And Scripture teaches the joining of this (i.e. the individual soul)
with that (i.e. bliss) in that (i.e. the ânandamaya).

'A flavour he is indeed; having obtained a flavour this one enjoys
bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that this one, i.e. the so-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> individual soul, enjoys bliss through obtaining the ânandamaya,
here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'flavour.' Now to say that any one is identical with that by
obtaining which he enjoys bliss, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be madness indeed.--It being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
ascertained that the Self of bliss is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, we conclude
that in passages such as 'if that bliss were not in the ether' (Taitt.
Up. II, 7). and 'knowledge, bliss is Brahman' (Bri. Up. III, 9, 28), the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ânanda' denotes the 'ânandamaya'; just as vijñâna means the
vijñânamaya. It is for the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (viz. of ânanda <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> the same
as ânandamaya) that the clause 'he who knows the bliss of Brahman'
exhibits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as being connected with ânanda, and that the further
clause 'he who knows this reaches the Self of bliss,' declares the
reaching of the Self of bliss to be the fruit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of bliss.
In the subsequent anuvâka also, in the clauses 'he perceived that <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span>
is Brahman,' 'he perceived that breath is Brahman,' &c. (III, i; 2, &c.),
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'food,' 'breath,' and so on, are meant to suggest the Self
made of food, the Self made of breath, &c., mentioned in the preceding
anuvâka; and hence also in the clause 'he perceived that bliss is
Brahman,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'bliss' must be understood to denote the Self of
bliss. Hence, in the same anuvâka, the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the fate after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knows concludes with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'having reached the Self
of bliss' (III, 10,5). It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> finally proved that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman--which in the previous adhikarana had to be shown to be other
than the so-called Pradhâna--is also other than the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
individual soul.--This concludes the topic of the ânandamaya.

A new doubt here presents itself.--It must indeed be admitted that such
individual souls as possess only a moderate degree of merit are unable
to accomplish the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by their mere wish, to enjoy
supreme bliss, to be the cause of fearlessness, and so on; but why
should not <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> like Âditya and Prajâpati, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> merit is
extraordinarily great, be capable of all this?--Of this suggestion the
next Sûtra disposes.




21. The one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the eye); on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his qualities

It is said in the Chândogya: 'Now that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> bright as gold, who is

also who knows this rises above all evil. Rik and Sâman are his joints.-
So much with reference to the devas.--Now with reference to the body.--
Now that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who is seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the eye, he is Rik, he is Sâman,

The text, 'That from which these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are born,' teaches that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

terms (' Being only this was in the beginning'; 'It sent forth fire';
'The Self only this was in the beginning,' &c.); and thereupon it is
shown on the basis of the special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that cause as proved by the

pradhâna and the individual souls. The remaining part of this Pâda now
is devoted to the task of proving that where such special terms as Ether

We read in the Chândogya (I, 9), 'What is the origin of this world?'
'Ether,' he replied. 'For all these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> spring from the ether only,
and return into the ether. Ether is greater than these; ether is their
rest.' Here there arises the doubt <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether' denotes the

from the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> that the well-known Ether is the cause of the entire
aggregate of things, moving or non-moving, and that hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the
same as Ether.--But has it not been shown that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something
different from non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> because its creative activity is
preceded by thought?--This has been asserted indeed, but by no means
proved. For the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to combine the different <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> is as follows.
Having been told that 'that from which these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> is Brahman',
we <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know more especially what that source of all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is, and
this <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> is satisfied by the special information given by the text,
'All these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> spring from the ether.' It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being ascertained that
the ether only is the cause of the origin, and so on, of the world, we
conclude that also such general terms as 'Being' ('Being only was this
in the beginning') denote the particular substance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'ether.' And
we further conclude that in passages such as 'the Self only was all this
in the beginning', the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Self (âtman) also denotes the ether; for
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is by no means limited to non-sentient things--cp., e.g., the
phrase, 'Clay constitutes the Self of the jar'--, and its etymology also
(âtman from âp, to reach) shows that it may very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be applied to the
ether. It having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> been ascertained that the ether is the general
cause or Brahman, we must interpret such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as 'thinking' (which we
meet with in connexion with the creative activity of the general cause)
in a suitable, i.e. secondary, or metaphorical sense. If the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
denoted the general cause by general terms only, such as 'Being', we
should, in agreement with the primary <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'thinking', and similar
terms, decide that that cause is an intelligent being; but since, as a
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of fact, we ascertain a particular cause on the basis of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'ether', our decision cannot be formed on general considerations of what
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> suit the sense.--But what then about the passage, 'From the Self
there sprang the ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1), from which it appears
that the ether itself is something created?--All elementary substances,
we reply, such as ether, air, and so on, have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> different states, a
gross material one, and a subtle one. The ether, in its subtle state, is
the universal cause; in its gross <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it is an effect of the primal
cause; in its gross <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> springs from itself, i.e. ether in the
subtle state. The text, 'All these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> spring from ether only' (Ch.
Up. I, 9, 1), declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> originates from ether only,
and from this it follows that ether is none other than the general cause
of the world, i.e. Brahman. This non-difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> from the
empirically known ether also gives a satisfactory <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as
the following: 'If this ether were not bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7, 1);
'Ether, indeed, is the evolver of names and forms' (Ch. Up. VIII, 14, 1,
and so on).--It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is none other than the well-
known elemental ether.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether' in the

established characteristics--which is something quite different from the
non-sentient elemental ether. For the qualities which the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
attributes to ether, viz. its being the one cause of the entire world,
its being greater than all, and the rest of all, clearly indicate the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The non-intelligent elemental ether cannot be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
cause of all, since intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> clearly cannot be its effects;
nor can it be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'rest' of intelligent beings, for non-sentient

absolutely superior to everything else.--Nor is the Pûrvapakshin right
when maintaining that, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether' satisfies the demand for a
special cause of the world, all other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are to be interpreted in
accordance herewith. The words, 'All these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> indeed spring from the
ether only,' merely give expression to something generally known, and
statements of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> presuppose other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to prove
them. Now these other means required are, in our case, supplied by such
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> as 'Being only was this in the beginning,' and these, as we have
shown, establish the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of Brahman. To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> established,

of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> capable of establishing the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a wonderful being

arrive at the following conclusion: Brahman, which--by the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
'Being only this was in the beginning'--is established as the sole cause

'ether.'--Here terminates the adhikarana of' ether.'




24. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> breath (is Brahman).

We read in the Chândogya (I, 10; ii), 'Prastotri, that deity which
belongs to the Prastâva,' &c.; and further on, 'which then is that deity?
He said--Breath. For all these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> merge into breath alone, and from
breath they arise. This is the deity belonging to the Prastâva. If

a further doubt; for as it is a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of observation that the existence,
activity, &c., of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of creatures depend on breath,

breath is not present in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as stones and wood, nor in

cannot be said that 'all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> enter into it,' &c. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>

discussion carried on in connexion with the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is that

the adhikarana of 'breath.'

The subsequent Sûtras up to the end of the Pâda demonstrate that the
being which the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> refer to as 'Light' or 'Indra'--terms which in
ordinary language are applied to certain other well-known beings--, and
which is represented as possessing some one or other supremely exalted
quality that is invariably connected with world-creative power, is no
other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.

We read in the Chândogya. (III, 13, 7), 'Now that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which shines

Pûrvapakshin maintains that the reference is to ordinary light. For, he
says, the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> does not mention a particular characteristic attribute
which can belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only--while such attributes _were_

Nor does the identification, made in a clause of the text, of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> with

The previous section at first refers to the metre <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gâyatrî, 'The
Gâyatrî indeed is everything' (III, 12, 1), and then introduces--with

the greatness of it (viz. the Gâyatrî),' &c. Now, as this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> also

To this objection the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> part of the Sûtra replies. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'Gâyatrî' does not here denote the metre only, since this cannot
possibly be the Self of all; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares the application of
the idea of Gâyatrî to Brahman, i.e. teaches, to the end of a certain
result being obtained, <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so far as similar to
Gâyatrî. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> having four feet, in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> indicated by the rik_,
may be compared to the Gâyatrî with its four (metrical) feet. The
Gâyatrî (indeed has as a rule <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> feet, but) occasionally a Gâyatrî
with four feet is met with; so, e.g., 'Indras sakîpatih | valena pîditah |
duskyavano vrishâ | samitsu sâsahih.' We see that in other passages also
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> primarily denoting metres are employed in other senses; thus, e.g.,
in the samvargavidyâ (Ch. Up. IV, 3, 8), where Virâj (the name of a
metre of ten syllables) denotes a group of ten <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings.

For this conclusion the next Sûtra supplies a further argument.




27. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> also, because (thus only) the designation of the beings,
and so on, being the (four) feet is possible.

The text, moreover, designates the Gâyatrî as having four feet, after
having referred to the beings, the earth, the body, and the heart; now
this has a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only if it is Brahman, which here is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gâyatrî.




28. If it be said that (Brahman is) not (recognised) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
difference of designation; (we say) not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of there being no
contradiction in either (designation).

In the former passage, 'three feet of it are what is immortal in heaven,'
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> is referred to as the abode of the being under discussion;
while in the latter passage, 'that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which shines above this heaven,'

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> referred to in the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is not recognised in the
latter.--This objection the Sûtra disposes of by pointing out that owing
to the essential agreement of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> statements, nothing stands in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the required recognition. When we say, 'The hawk is on the top of
the tree,' and 'the hawk is above the top of the tree,' we mean one and
the same thing.--The 'light,' therefore, is nothing else but the most
glorious and luminous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person. Him who in the former <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> four-footed, we know to have an extraordinarily beautiful shape
and colour--(cp., e.g., 'I know that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> of sunlike colour
beyond the darkness' (Svet. Up. III, 9))--, and as hence his brilliancy
also must be extraordinary, he is, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion, quite
appropriately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'light.'--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'light.'

It has been shown that the being endowed with supreme brilliance, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
'Light,' which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> mentions as something <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Person. The Sûtrakâra will now show that the being designated as Indra
and Prâna, which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins as an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation, for the
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it is the means for attaining immortality--a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which is
inseparable from causal power--, is likewise the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person.




29. Prâna is Brahman, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of connexion.

We read in the Pratardana-vidyâ in the Kaushîtaki-brâhmana that
'Pratardana, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Divodâsa, came, by fighting and strength, to the
beloved abode of Indra.' Being asked by Indra to choose a boon he
requests the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to bestow on him that boon which he himself considers
most beneficial to man; whereupon Indra says, 'I am prâna (breath), the
intelligent Self, meditate on me as Life, as Immortality.' Here the
doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna and Indra, and designating
itself as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> most beneficial to man, is an
individual soul, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--An individual soul, the
Pûrvapakshin maintains. For, he says, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Indra' is known to
denote an individual God, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Prâna,' which stands in
grammatical co-ordination with Indra, also applies to individual souls.
This individual being, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indra, instructs Pratardana that
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on himself is most beneficial to man. But what is most
beneficial to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is only the means to attain immortality, and such a
means is found in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the causal principle of the world, as we
know from the text, 'For him there is delay only so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he is not
delivered; then he will be perfect' (Ch. Up. VI, 14, 2). We hence
conclude that Indra, who is known as an individual soul, is the causal
principle, Brahman.

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is rejected by the Sûtra. The being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indra and Prâna is
not a mere individual soul, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which is other than
all individual souls. For on this supposition only it is appropriate
that the being introduced as Indra and Prâna should, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of
grammatical co-ordination, be connected with such terms as 'blessed,'
'non-ageing,' 'immortal.' ('That Prâna indeed is the intelligent Self,
blessed, non-ageing, immortal,' Kau. Up. III, 9.)




30. If it be said that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
speaker denoting himself; (we say, not so), because the multitude of
connexions with the inner Self (is possible only) in that (speaker if
viewed as Brahman).

An objection is raised.--That the being introduced as Indra and Prâna
should be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it is identical with
him who, later on, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'blessed,' 'non-ageing,' 'immortal'--this we
cannot admit. 'Know me only, I am prâna, meditate on me as the
intelligent Self, as life, as immortality'--the speaker of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
is Indra, and this Indra enjoins on Pratardana <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on his own
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> only, the individual character of which is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out by
reference to certain deeds of strength such as the slaying of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of
Tvashtri ('I slew the three-headed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Tvashtri,' &c.). As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the
initial part of the section clearly refers to an individual being, the
terms occurring in the concluding part ('blessed,' 'non-ageing,'
'immortal') must be interpreted so as to make them agree with what
precedes.--This objection the Sûtra disposes of. 'For the multitude of
connexions with the Self'--i.e. the multitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> connected with
the Self as its attributes--is possible only 'in that,' i.e. in that
speaker viewed as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. 'For, as in a car, the
circumference of the wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on
the nave, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> are these objects placed on the subjects, and the
subjects on the prâna. That prâna indeed is the intelligent Self,
blessed, non-ageing, immortal.' The 'objects' (bhûtamâtrâh) here are the
aggregate of non-sentient things; the 'subjects' (prajñâmâtrâh) are the
sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in which the objects are said to abide; when thereupon
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> says that of these subjects the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indra and Prâna
is the abode, and that he is blessed, non-ageing, immortal; this
qualification of being the abode of this Universe, with all its non-
sentient and sentient beings, can belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, which
is other than all individual souls.

The Sûtra may also be explained in a somewhat different way, viz. 'there
is a multitude of connexions belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, i.e. of
attributes special to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, in that, viz. section.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
at first says, 'Choose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> that boon for me which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> deemest most
beneficial to man'--to which the reply is, 'Meditate on me.' Here Indra-
prâna is represented as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> which is to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
about Release; the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of such <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> can be none but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self.--'He makes him whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds do a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deed; and him whom he wishes to lead down from these worlds he
makes do a bad deed.' The causality with regard to all actions which is
here described is again a special attribute of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The
same has to be said with regard to the attribute of being the abode of
all, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> about the wheel and spokes, quoted above; and with
regard to the attributes of bliss, absence of old age and immortality,
referred to in another <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> quoted before. Also the attributes of
being 'the ruler of the worlds, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of all,' can belong to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.--The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Indra and Prâna is none other but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--But how then can
Indra, who is known to be an individual <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> only, enjoin <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
on himself?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.




31. The instruction (given by Indra about himself) (is possible) through
insight based on Scripture, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Vâmadeva.

The instruction which, in the passages quoted, Indra gives as to the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constituting his Self, is not based
on such an insight into his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as is established by other means
of proof, but on an intuition of his own Self, mediated by Scripture.
'Having entered into them with this living Self let me evolve names and
forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2); 'In it all that exists has its Self (Ch. Up.
VI, 8, 7); Entered within, the ruler of creatures, the Self of all'
(Taitt. Ar. III, 21); 'He who dwelling in the Self is different from the
Self,' &c. (Bri. Up. III, 7, 22)--from these and similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> Indra has
learned that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self has the indiviual souls for its body, and
that hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as 'I' and 'thou,' which denote individual beings,
extend in their connotation up to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; when, therefore, he
says, 'Know me only', and 'Meditate on me', he really means to teach
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, of which his own individual <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is the body,
is the proper <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation. 'As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Vâmadeva.' As the
Rishi Vâmadeva perceiving that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the inner Self of all, that
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> constitute its body, and that the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> extends up to the principle embodied, denotes with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'I' the

and then predicates of this 'I' Manu Sûrya and other beings--'Seeing
this the Rishi. Vâmadeva understood, I am Manu, I am Sûrya' (Bri. Up. I,
4, 10). Similarly Prahlâda says, 'As the Infinite one abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> all,
he constitutes my "I" also; all is from me, I am all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me is all.'
(Vi. Pu. I, 19, 85.) The next Sûtra states, in reply to an objection,
the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why, in the section under discussion, terms denoting the

say no, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the threefoldness of meditation; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
(such threefold meditation) being met (in other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also); and on

An objection is raised. 'Let none try to <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> out what speech is, let
him know the speaker'; 'I slew the three-headed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Tvashtri; I

alone is the conscious Self, and having laid hold of this body, it makes
it rise up.'--These passages again mention characteristic attributes of
the chief vital air. Hence there is here no 'multitude of attributes
belonging to the Self.'--The latter part of the Sûtra refutes this
objection. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by these different terms in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>

in itself as the cause of the entire world; on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as having for its

<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman, moreover, is met with also in other chapters of
the sacred text. Passages such as 'The True, knowledge, infinite is
Brahman,' 'Bliss is Brahman,' dwell on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in itself. Passages again
such as 'Having <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> that he entered into it. Having entered it he
became _sat_ and _tyat_, defined and undefined,' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 6),
represent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as having for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the individual souls and

individual <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> such as Hiranyagarbha, and so on, or to particular

qualities especially belonging--to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; or where with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>

the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, the intention of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> is to convey the idea of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self being the inner Self of all such persons and things.--
The settled conclusion, therefore, is that the being designated as Indra
and Prâna is other than an individual soul, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.




<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">SECOND</span> PÂDA.

THE contents of the first Pâda may be summed up as follows:--It has been
shown that a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has read the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Veda; who further,
through the study of the Karma-Mîmâmsa, has acquired a <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of (sacrificial and similar) works, and has recognised that
the fruits of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are limited and non-permanent; in whom there
has arisen the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man, i.e. Release, which,
as he has come to know in the course of reading the Vedânta portions of
scripture, is effected by <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman--such
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> having an infinite and permanent result; who has convinced
himself that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are capable of conveying information about
accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (not only about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be done), and has arrived
at the conclusion that the Vedânta-texts are an authoritative means of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman;--that such a person, we
say, should begin the study of the Sârîraka-Mîmâmsâ which indicates the
method how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be known through the Vedânta-texts.

We next have shown that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'That from which these creatures are
born,' &c., conveys the idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as that being which
in sport, as it were, creates, sustains, and finally reabsorbs this
entire universe, comprising <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself infinite numbers of variously
constituted animated beings--moving and non-moving--, of objects of
enjoyment for those beings, of means of enjoyment, and of abodes of
enjoyment; and which is the sole cause of all bliss. We have established
that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which is the sole cause of the world, cannot
be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the other means of knowledge, and hence is to be known
through scripture only. We have pointed out that the position of
scripture as an authoritative means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is established by the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that all the Vedânta-texts connectedly refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman,
which, although not related to any injunctions of action or abstention
from action, by its own essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> end of
man. We have proved that Brahman, which the Vedânta-texts teach to be
the sole cause of the world, must be an intelligent principle other than
the non-sentient pradhâna, since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is said to think. We have
declared that this intelligent principle is other than the so-called
individual soul, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage or that of release;
since the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> describe it as in the enjoyment of supreme bliss, all-
wise, the cause of <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> or fearlessness on the part of intelligent
beings, the inner Self of all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> things, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> intelligent or non-
intelligent, possessing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of realising all its purposes, and so
on.--We have maintained that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being has a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> form,
peculiar to itself, not made of the stuff of Prakriti, and not due to
karman.--We have explained that the being which some <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> refer to as a
well-known cause of the world--designating it by terms such as ether or
breath, which generally denote a special non-sentient being--is that
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self which is different from all beings, sentient or non-
sentient.--We have declared that, owing to its connexion with heaven,
this same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is to be recognised in what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> calls a
'light,' said to possess supreme splendour, such as forms a special
characteristic of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being. We have stated that, as we
recognise through insight derived from scripture, that same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> is denoted by terms such as Indra, and so on; as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
ascribes to that 'Indra' qualities exclusively belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self, such, e.g., as being the cause of the attainment of immortality.--
And the general result arrived at was that the Vedânta-texts help us to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of one being only, viz. Brahman, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, or
Nârâyana--of whom it is shown that he cannot possibly be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
the other means of knowledge, and whom the possession of an unlimited
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of glorious qualities proves to differ totally from all other
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> whatsoever.

Now, although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the only <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the teaching of the Vedânta-
texts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> some of these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> might give rise to the notion that they
aim at setting forth (not Brahman), but some particular being comprised
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> either the pradhâna or the aggregate of individual souls. The
remaining Pâdas of the first Adhyâya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> apply themselves to the
task of dispelling this notion and proving that what the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in
question aim at is to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth certain glorious qualities of Brahman.
The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Pâda discusses those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which contain somewhat obscure
references to the individual soul; the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> Pâda those which contain
clear references to the same; and the fourth Pâda finally those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
which appear to contain even clearer intimations of the individual soul,
and so on.




1. Everywhere; because there is taught what is known.

We read in the Chândogya, 'Man is made of thought; according to what his

Or else we may interpret the Vedic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and the Sûtra as follows. The

statement to that injunction, the purport of which is to suggest certain
attributes of Brahman, such as being made of mind. So that the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>

Here a doubt presents itself. Does the term 'Brahman' in this section

the Pûrvapakshin maintains, for that only admits of being exhibited in

the root of which is the beginningless Nescience of the individual soul.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, on the other hand, which is all-knowing, all-

attested by scripture: 'That (soul) is fit for infinity' (Svet. Up. V,

maintained that of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also identity with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> can
be predicated; for the souls being separate according to the bodies with

causality with regard to the world's creation, sustentation, and

the Pûrvapakshin improve his <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> by contending that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

all the same the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> alone is the cause of the Universe.--All this
proves that the being to which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is none other
than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.

This <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> alternative interpretation of the Sûtra is preferred by most
competent persons. The Vrittikâra, e.g. says, 'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which the
clause "All this is Brahman" declares to be the Self of all is the Lord.'




2. And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible (in
Brahman).

The qualities about to be stated can belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.
'Made of mind, having breath for its body,' &c. 'Made of mind' means to
be apprehended by a purified <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> only. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self can be

<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> being assisted by the seven means, viz. abstention, &c. (see

precluding all evil, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> different in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from everything
else; for by the impure minded impure objects only can be apprehended.--
'Having the vital breath for its body' means--being the supporter of all

To stand in the relation of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to something else,
means to abide in that other thing, to be dependent on it, and to
subserve it in a subordinate capacity, as we shall fully show later on.
And all 'vital breath' or 'life' stands in that relation to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

3. But, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of impossibility, not the embodied soul.

Those who fully consider this infinite multitude of exalted qualities
will recognise that not even a shadow of them can belong to the
individual soul--whether in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage or that of release--
which is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as insignificant as a glow-worm and, through its

not possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to hold that the section under discussion should
refer to the individual soul.




4. And because there is (separate) denotation of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> and the
agent.

The clause 'When I shall have departed from hence I shall obtain him'
denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be obtained, and the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as that which obtains it. This shows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which
obtains is the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> meditating, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that is to be
obtained, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation: Brahman, therefore, is something
different from the attaining soul.




5. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the difference of words.

The clause 'That is the Self of me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart' designates the
embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> by means of a genitive form, while the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is exhibited in the nominative case. Similarly, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the
Vâjasaneyins, which treats of the same topic, applies different terms to
the embodied and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, 'Like a rice grain, or a barley grain,
or a canary seed, or the kernel of a canary seed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that golden
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Self' (Sat. Br. X, 6, 3, 2). Here the locative form,
'within the Self,' denotes the embodied Self, and the nominative, 'that
golden Person,' the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be meditated on.--All this proves the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self to be the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation.




6. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Smriti.

'I dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the hearts of all, from me come memory and knowledge, as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as their loss'; 'He who <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from delusion knows me to be the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person'; 'The Lord, O Arjuna, is seated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of all
Beings, driving round by his mysterious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> as if mounted
on a machine; to him fly for refuge' (Bha. Gi. XV, 15, 19; XVIII, 61).
These Smriti-texts show the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to be the meditating subject,
and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation.




7. Should it be said that (the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> does) not (refer to Brahman) on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the smallness of the abode, and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the denotation
of that (viz. minuteness of the being meditated on); we say no, because
(Brahman) has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to be meditated upon, and because (in the same
passage) it is said to be like ether.

It might be contended that, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'he is my Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart'
declares the being meditated on to dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a minute abode, viz. the
heart; and as moreover another text--'smaller than a grain of rice,' &c.,
declares it to be itself of minute size, that being cannot be the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, but only the embodied soul. For other passages <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as unlimited, and of the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as having the
size of the point of a goad (cp. e.g. Mu. Up. I, 1, 6, and Svet. Up. V,
8).--This objection the Sûtra rebuts by declaring that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
is spoken of as such, i.e. minute, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its having to be
meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> as such. Such minuteness does not, however, belong to its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nature; for in the same section it is distinctly declared to be
infinite like ether--'greater than the earth, greater than the sky,
greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds' (Ch. Up. III, 14, 3).
This shows that the designation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as minute is for the
purpose of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only.--The connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section then is
as follows. The clause 'All this is Brahman; let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate with
calm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as beginning, ending, and breathing in Brahman,'
enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as being the Self of all, in so far as it
is the cause of the origin and destruction of all, and entering into all
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> as their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to them. The next clause, 'Man is made
of thought; according as his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is in this world, so will he be
when he has departed this life,' declares the attainment of the desired
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to depend on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the meditation; and the following
clause, 'Let him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the following thought,' thereupon
repeats the injunction with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the declaration of details. The
clause 'He who consists of mind,' &c., up to 'who is never surprised,'
then states the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and qualities, of the being to be meditated upon,
which are to be comprised in the meditation. Next, the clause 'He is my
Self,' up to 'the kernel of a canary seed,' declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Person, for the purpose of meditation, abides in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of the
meditating devotee; representing it as being itself minute, since the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is minute. After this the clause 'He also is my Self,' up to 'who
is never surprised,' describes those aspects of the being meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, which are to be attained by the devotee. Next, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'this my Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is that Brahman' enjoins the
reflection that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, as described before, is, owing to
its supreme kindness, present in our hearts in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> thereby to refresh
and inspirit us. Then the clause 'When I shall have departed from hence
I shall obtain him' suggests the idea that there is a certainty of
obtaining him on the basis of devout meditation; and finally the clause
'He who has this <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> has no doubt' declares that the devotee who is
firmly convinced of his aim being attainable in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described, will
attain it beyond any doubt.--From all this it appears that the
'limitation of abode,' and the 'minuteness' ascribed to Brahman, are
merely for the purpose of meditation.




8. Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition (of pleasure
and pain); we reply, not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference.

But, if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is assumed to dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> bodies, like the
individual soul, it follows that, like the latter, it is subject to the
experience of pleasure and pain, such experience springing from
connexion with bodies!--Of this objection the Sûtra disposes by
remarking 'not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference (of reason).' For what is
the cause of experiences, pleasurable or painful, is not the mere
dwelling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a body, but rather the subjection to the influence of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds; and such subjection is impossible in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self to which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is foreign. Compare the scriptural
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'One of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eats the sweet fruit, the other one looks on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1).--Here finishes the adhikarana of
'what is known everywhere.'

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> then, if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is not an enjoyer, we must conclude that
wherever fruition is referred to, the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only is meant!--Of
this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next adhikarana disposes.




9. The eater (is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of there being <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> all
that is movable and immovable.

We read in the Kathavallî (I, 3, 25), 'Who then knows where he is to
whom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but food, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> itself a
condiment?' A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the 'eater', suggested by the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'food' and 'condiment,' is the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--
The individual soul, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; for all enjoyment
presupposes works, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> belong to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only.--Of
this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes. The 'eater' can be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only,
because the taking, i. e. eating, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of movable and
immovable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> can be predicated of that Self only. 'Eating' does not
here mean fruition dependent on work, but rather the act of reabsorption
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> on the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, i. e. Vishnu, who is
the cause of the origination, subsistence, and final destruction of the
universe. This appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that Vishnu is mentioned in the
same section, 'He reaches the end of his journey, and that is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Vishnu' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 9). Moreover the clause 'to whom
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> is a condiment' shows that by the Brahmans and Kshattriyas,
mentioned in the text, we have to understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> universe of
moving and non-moving things, viewed as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be consumed by the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. For a condiment is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which, while itself being eaten,
causes other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to be eaten; the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the passage, therefore,
is that while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> itself is consumed, being a condiment as it were,
there is at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> eaten whatever is flavoured or made palatable
by death, and that is the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in which the Brahmans
and Kshattriyas hold the foremost place. Now such eating of course is
destruction or reabsorption, and hence such enjoyment--meaning general
reabsorption--can belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.




10. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the topic of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section.

Moreover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constitutes the topic of the entire section.
Cp. 'The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> who knows the Self as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and omnipresent does not
grieve' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 22); 'That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor
by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him
the Self can be gained; the Self chooses him as his own' (I, 2, 23).--
Moreover, the clause (forming part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion),'Who
knows him (i.e. the being which constitutes the topic of the section)
where he is?' clearly shows that we have to recognise here the Self of
which it had previously been said that it is hard to know unless it
assists us with its grace.

To this conclusion a new objection presents itself.--Further on in the
same Upanishad (I, 3, 1) we meet with the following text: 'There are two,
drinking their reward in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of their own works, entered into the
cave, dwelling on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> summit; those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> them
shade and light, likewise those householders who perform the Trinakiketa-
sacrifice.' Now this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> clearly refers to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which
enjoys the reward of its works, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with an associate coupled to it.
And this associate is either the vital breath, or the organ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(buddhi). For the drinking of 'rita' is the enjoyment of the fruit of
works, and such enjoyment does not suit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The buddhi, or
the vital breath, on the other hand, which are instruments of the
enjoying embodied soul, may somehow be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into connexion with the
enjoyment of the fruit of works. As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> seen to refer to
the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> coupled with some associate, we infer, on the ground
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> belonging to one section, that also the 'eater'
described in the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is none other than the individual soul.--To
this objection the next Sûtra replies.




11. The 'two entered into the cave' are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Selfs; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
this being seen.

The two, entered into the cave and drinking their reward, are neither
the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the vital breath, nor the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the buddhi; it is rather the embodied Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self which are designated by those terms. For this is seen, i.e. it is
seen that in that section the individual Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only
are spoken of as entered into the cave. To the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self there refers
I, 2, 12, 'The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> who by <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on his Self recognises the Ancient
who is difficult to see, who has entered into the dark, who is hidden in
the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and
sorrow far behind.' And to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> there refers I, 4, 7,
'Who is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the vital breath, who is Aditi, who is made of the
deities, who entering into the cave abides therein, who was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span>
variously through the elements.' Aditi here means the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
which enjoys (atti) the fruits of its works; which is associated with
the vital breath; which is made of the deities, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> enjoyment is
dependent on the different sense-organs; which abides in the hollow of
the heart; and which, being connected with the elementary substances,
earth, and so on, is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in various forms--human, divine, &c.--That the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> speaks of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Selfs as drinking their reward (while actually
the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only does so) is to be understood in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
the phrase 'there go the umbrella-bearers' (one of whom only carries the
umbrella). Or else we may <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for this on the ground that both are
agents with regard to the drinking, in so far as the 'drinking'
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is caused to drink by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.




12. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of distinctive qualities.

Everywhere in that section we meet with statements of distinctive
attributes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Selfs, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self being represented as the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and attainment, and the individual Self as the
meditating and attaining subject. The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'When he has known and
understood that which is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> from Brahman, the intelligent, to be

refers to the meditating individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which recognises itself as
being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman. On the other hand, I, 3, 2, 'That which
is a bridge for sacrificers, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> imperishable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for those
who wish to cross over to the fearless shore, the Nâkiketa, may we be
able to know that,' refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
meditation; 'Nâkiketa' here <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> that which is to be reached through
the Nâkiketa-rite. Again, the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'Know the Self to be sitting in
the chariot and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to be the chariot' (I, 3, 3) refers to the
meditating individual soul; and the verse, I, 3, 9, 'But he who has
understanding for his charioteer, and holds the reins of the mind, he
reaches the end of his journey, and that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Vishnu.'
refers to the embodied and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Selfs as that which attains and
that which is to be attained. And in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion also (I,
3, 1), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Selfs are distinctly designated as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and shade, the
one being all-knowing, the other devoid of knowledge.

But, a new objection is raised, the initial passage, I, 1, 20, 'That
doubt which there is when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is dead--some saying, he is; others, he

as to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> or non-existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> apart from the body;
for if this were so the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> first boons chosen by Nâkiketas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
unsuitable. For the story runs as follows: When the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> offered by
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of Nâkiketas--at which all the possessions of the sacrificer
were to be given to the priests--is drawing towards its close, the boy,
feeling afraid that some deficiency on the part of the gifts might
render the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> unavailing, and dutifully wishing to render his
father's <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> complete by giving his own <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> also, repeatedly
asks his father, 'And to whom will you give me'? The father, irritated
by the boy's persistent questioning, gives an angry reply, and in
consequence of this the boy goes to the palace of Yama, and Yama being
absent, stays there for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating. Yama on his return is
alarmed at this neglect of hospitality, and wishing to make up for it
allows him to choose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> boons. Nâkiketas, thereupon, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span>
and piety, chooses as his first boon that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> should forgive him.
Now it is clear that conduct of this kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be possible in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of one not convinced of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> having an <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> independent of
the body. For his <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> boon, again, he chooses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of a

that has departed from the body; and this choice also can clearly be
made only by one who knows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is something different from the
body. When, therefore, he chooses for his <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> boon the clearing up of
his doubt as to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> (as stated in v.
20), it is evident that his question is prompted by the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to

thereof, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of final Release which consists in
obtaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. The passage, therefore, is not concerned
merely with the problem as to the separation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from the body,
but rather with the problem of the Self freeing itself from all bondage
whatever--the same problem, in fact, with which another scriptural
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> also is concerned, viz. 'When he has departed there is no more
knowledge' (Bri. Up. II, 4, 12). The <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> purport of Nâkiketas' question,
therefore, is as follows: When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> qualified for Release has died and

<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> or non-existence--a doubt due to the disagreement of
philosophers as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Release; in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to clear up this

Philosophers, indeed, hold many widely differing opinions as to what
constitutes Release. Some hold that the Self is constituted by
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only, and that Release consists in the total destruction
of this essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self. Others, while holding the same
opinion as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self, define Release as the passing away
of Nescience (avidyâ). Others hold that the Self is in itself non-
sentient, like a stone, but possesses, in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage, certain
distinctive qualities, such as knowledge, and so on. Release then
consists in the total removal of all these qualities, the Self remaining
in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of pure isolation (kaivalya). Others, again, who acknowledge
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all imperfection, maintain that through
connexion with limiting adjuncts that Self enters on the condition of an
individual soul; Release then means the pure <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self, consequent on the passing away of the limiting adjuncts. Those,
however, who understand the Vedânta, teach as follows: There is a

influence of the beginningless chain of works; and by _Release_ then we
have to understand that intuition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, which is the
natural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of the individual souls, and which follows on the
destruction of Nescience.--When Nâkiketas desires Yama graciously to
teach him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Release and the means to attain it, Yama at
first tests him by dwelling on the difficulty of comprehending Release,
and by tempting him with various worldly enjoyments. But having in this

The Chandogas have the following text: 'The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> that is seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

this we make the following reply. As both passages (viz. IV, 10, 5,

is a mere subordinate member of the latter. This also appears from the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Gârhapatya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> begins to instruct Upakosala only after he

complains that he is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of sorrows (I, 10, 3), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> shows himself

remembering that, as scripture says, 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acquired from a

But--an objection is raised--how do you know that the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'Ka
(pleasure) is Brahman, Kha (ether) is Brahman' really refers to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, so as to be able to interpret on that basis the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> about Ka and Kha as enjoining a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

pleasure. This interpretation would, moreover, be in agreement with
other similarly worded <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> (which are generally understood to enjoin
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in a definite form), such as 'Name is Brahman',
'Mind is Brahman.'




16. For that very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that (ether) is Brahman.

Because the clause 'What is Ka the same is Kha' speaks of ether as
characterised by pleasure, the ether which is denoted by 'Kha' is no
other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. To explain. On the Fires declaring
'Breath is Brahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,' Upakosala says, 'I
understand that breath is Brahman, but I do not understand Ka and Kha.'
The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of this is as follows. The Fires cannot <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of breath and so on, because they are engaged
in giving instruction to me, who am afraid of birth, old age, death, &c.,
and desirous of final Release. What they declare to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself.

either from the point of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> having the attribute of

We have, under Sû. I, 2, 14, assumed as proved that the abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

Self, they in turn constituting his body. Now this is a position which
can belong to none else but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, who is all-knowing, and

Upanishad-texts also declare; cp. e.g. 'Entered within, the ruler of
creatures, the Self of all'; 'Having sent forth this he entered into it.
Having entered it he became sat and tyat,' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 6).
Similarly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> from the Subâla-Up., which begins, 'there was not

on sense-organs; it rather results immediately from its essential
nature, since its omniscience and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to realise its purposes are due
to its own being only. In agreement herewith scripture says, 'He sees

'hearing' really denote is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in so far as produced by the

other hand, it springs from its own nature.--Again, the clause 'there is
no other seer but he' means that there is no seer other than the seer
and ruler described in the preceding clauses. To explain. The clauses
'whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> does not know,' &c., up to 'whom the Self does not know'
mean to say that the Ruler <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> rules <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being perceived by the
earth, Self, and the other <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> which he rules. This is confirmed by
the subsequent clauses, 'unseen but a seer', 'unheard but a hearer,' &c.
And the next clauses, 'there is no other seer but he,' &c., then mean to
negative that there is any other being which could be viewed as the
ruler of that Ruler. Moreover, the clauses 'that is the Self of thee,'
'He is the Self of thee' exhibit the individual Self in the genitive
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> ('of thee'), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> distinguish it from the Ruler within, who is
declared to be their Self.




20. And not that which Smriti assumes, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the declaration of
qualities not belonging to that; nor the embodied one.

'That which Smriti assumes' is the Pradhâna; the 'embodied one' is the
individual soul. Neither of these can be the Ruler within, since the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> states attributes which cannot possibly belong to either. For there
is not even the shadow of a possibility that essential capability of
seeing and ruling all things, and being the Self of all, and immortality
should belong either to the non-sentient Pradhâna or to the individual
soul.--The last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras have declared that the mentioned qualities
belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, while they do not belong to the individual
soul. The next Sûtra supplies a new, independent argument.




21. For both also <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of it as something different.

Both, i.e. the Mâdhyandinas as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Kânvas, distinguish in their
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> the embodied soul, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with speech and other non-intelligent
things, from the Ruler within, representing it as an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his rule.
The Mâdhyandinas read, 'He who dwells in the Self, whom the Self does
not know,' &c.; the Kânvas, 'He who dwells <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> understanding', &c.
The declaration of the individual Self being ruled by the Ruler <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
implies of course the declaration of the former being different from the
latter.

The conclusion from all this is that the Ruler <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> is a being
different from the individual soul, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all
evil, Nârâyana.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the internal Ruler'.




22. That which possesses the qualities of invisibility, &c., on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
of the declaration of attributes.

The Âtharvanikas read in their text, 'The <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is that by
which that Indestructible is apprehended. That which is invisible,
unseizable, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> origin and qualities, &c., that it is which the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>
regard as the source of all beings'; and further on, 'That which is
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Imperishable' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5, 6; II, 1, 2). The
doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Indestructible, possessing the qualities
of imperceptibility, &c., and that which is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
Indestructible, should be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to denote the Pradhâna and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of
the Sânkhyas, or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> both denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The Pûrvapakshin
maintains the former alternative. For, he says, while in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> last
discussed there is mentioned a special attribute of an intelligent being,
viz. in the clause 'unseen but a seer', no similar attribute is stated
in the former of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> under discussion, and the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
clearly describes the collective individual soul, which is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than
the imperishable Pradhâna, which itself is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than all its effects.
The reasons for this decision are as follows:--Colour and so on reside
in the gross forms of non-intelligent matter, viz. the elements, earth,
and so on. When, therefore, visibility and so on are expressly negatived,
such negation suggests a non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> cognate to earth, &c., but
of a subtle kind, and such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is no other than the Pradhâna. And as
something <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than this Pradhâna there are known the collective souls
only, under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> guidance the Pradhâna gives birth to all its effects,
from the so-called Mahat downwards to individual things. This
interpretation is confirmed by the comparisons <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the next
sloka, 'As the spider sends forth and draws in its threads, as plants
spring from the earth, as hair grows on the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the living
man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does everything arise here from the Indestructible.' The
section <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is concerned only with the Pradhâna and the individual
soul.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. That which possesses
invisibility and the other qualities stated in the text, and that which
is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Indestructible, is no other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares attributes which belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
only, viz. in I, 1, 9, 'He who knows all, cognises all,' &c. Let us
shortly consider the connexion of the text. The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> beginning 'the
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is that by which the Indestructible is apprehended'
declares an indestructible being possessing the attributes of
invisibility and so on. The clause 'everything arises here from the
Indestructible' next declares that from that being all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> originate.
Next the sloka, 'He who knows all and cognises all,' predicates of that
Indestructible which is the source of all beings, omniscience, and
similar qualities. And finally the text, 'That which is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
<span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Indestructible,' characterises that same being--which previously
had been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> invisible, the source of beings, indestructible, all-
knowing, &c.--as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> of all. Hence it is evident that in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'higher than the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Indestructible' the term 'Indestructible'
does not denote the invisible, &c. Indestructible, which is the chief
topic of the entire section; for there can of course be nothing <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span>
than that which, as being all-knowing, the source of all, &c., is itself
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than anything else. The 'Indestructible' in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>

everything is known; and it moreover, in passages such as 'higher than
the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Indestructible,' explicitly states the difference of the
indestructible being from those other two.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> first relates that

approached Angiras respectfully and asked him: 'What is that through

indirect one which springs from the study of the sâstras, viz. the Veda,

Up. IV, 4, 22).--Thus the Reverend Parâsara also says, 'The cause of

souls, which itself is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the non-evolved subtle elements.' The
term 'akshara' (imperishable) is to be etymologically explained either
as that which pervades (asnute) or that which does not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away (a-

25. Vaisvânara (is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the distinctions
qualifying the common term.

The Chandogas read in their text, 'You know at present that Vaisvânara
Self, tell us that,' &c., and further on, 'But he who meditates on the
Vaisvânara Self as a span long,' &c. (Ch. Up. V, 11, 6; 18, 1). The
doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> that Vaisvânara Self can be made out to be the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self or not. The Pûrvapakshin maintains the latter alternative.
For, he says, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Vaisvânara is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in four
different senses. It denotes in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the intestinal fire, so
in Bri. Up, V, 9, 'That is the Vaisvânara <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> by which the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> that is
eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise is that which one hears when
one covers one's ears. When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is on the point of departing this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
he does not hear that noise.'--It next denotes the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> of the elements,
so in Ri_. Samh. X, 88, 12, 'For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> have made the
<span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> Vaisvânara a sign of the days.'--It also denotes a divinity, so Ri_.
Samh. I, 98, 1, 'May we be in the favour of Vaisvânara, for he is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the kings,' &c. And finally it denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, as in
the passage, 'He offered it in the Self, in the heart, in <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span>
Vaisvânara'; and in Pra. Up. I, 7, 'Thus he rises as Vaisvânara,
assuming all forms, as breath of life, as fire.'--And the characteristic
marks mentioned in the introductory clauses of the Chandogya-text under
discussion admit of interpretations agreeing with every one of these
meanings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Vaisvânara.

Against this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra declares itself. The term
'Vaisvânara' in the Chândogya-text denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, because the
'common' term is there qualified by attributes specially belonging to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. For the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> tells us how Aupamanyava and four
other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Rhshis, having met and discussed the question as to what was
their Self and Brahman, come to the conclusion to go to Uddâlaka because
he is reputed to know the Vaisvânara Self. Uddâlaka, recognising their
anxiety to know the Vaisvânara Self, and deeming himself not to be fully
informed on this point, refers them to Asvapati Kaikeya as thoroughly
knowing the Vaisvânara Self; and they thereupon, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with Uddâlaka,
approach Asvapati. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> duly honours them with presents, and as they
appear unwilling to receive them, explains that they may suitably do so,
he himself being engaged in the performance of a religious vow; and at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> instructs them that even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> must avoid
what is forbidden and do what is prescribed. When thereupon he adds that
he will give them as much wealth as to the priests engaged in his
sacrifice, they, desirous of Release and of knowing the Vaisânara Self,
request him to explain that Self to them. Now it clearly appears that as
the Rishis are said to be desirous of knowing--that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the
Self of the individual souls ('what is our Self, what is Brahman'), and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> search for some one to instruct them on that point, the
Vaisvânara Self--to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> acquainted with which they address
themselves--can be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only. In the earlier clauses the
terms <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> are 'Self' and 'Brahman,' in the later 'Self' and 'Vaisvânara';
from this it appears also that the term 'Vaisvânara,' which takes the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of 'Brahman,' denotes none other but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The results,
moreover, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Vaisvânara Self, which are stated in
subsequent passages, show that the Vaisvânara Self is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman. 'He eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs'; 'as
the fibres of the Ishîkâ reed when thrown into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> are burnt, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
all his sins are burned' (V, 18, I; 24, 3).

The next Sûtra supplies a further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for the same conclusion.




26. That which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to is an inferential mark--thus.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> describes the shape of Vaisvânara, of whom heaven, &c., down to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> constitute the several limbs; and it is known from Scripture and
Smriti that such is the shape of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. When, therefore, we
recognise that shape as referred to in the text, this supplies an
inferential mark of Vaisvânara being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The 'thus' (iti)
in the Sûtra denotes a certain mode, that is to say, 'a shape of such a
kind being recognised in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enables us to infer that Vaisvânara is
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.' For in Scripture and Smriti alike the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span>
is declared to have such a shape. Cp. e.g. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Átharvanas.
'Agni is his head, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon his eyes, the regions his cars, his

from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the inner Self of all things'
(Mu. Up. II, I, 4). 'Agni' in this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> denotes the heavenly world,
in agreement with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> indeed is Agni.' And the
following Smrriti texts: 'He of whom the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> declare the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

the ear; worship to him, the Self of the Universe!'--Now our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

other limbs of Vaisvânara. For Kaikeya on being asked by the Rishis to

hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.
Jaimini, on the other hand, is of opinion that there is no reasonable
objection to the term 'Agni,' no less than the term: 'Vaisvânara,' being
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> _directly_ to denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. That is to say--in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the term 'Vaisvânara,' although a common term, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> when qualified
by attributes especially belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is known to
denote the latter only as possessing the quality of ruling all men; so
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Agni' also when appearing in connexion with special attributes
belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self denotes that Self only. For any quality on
the ground of which 'Agni' may be etymologically explained to denote
ordinary fire--as when e.g. we explain 'agni' as he who 'agre nayati'--
may also, in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> non-conditioned degree, be ascribed to the
supreme Self. Another difficulty remains. The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (V, 18, 1) 'yas tv
etam evam prâdesamâtram abhivimânam,' &c. declares that the non-limited
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is limited by the measure of the pradesas, i.e. of the
different spaces-heaven, ether, earth, &c.--which had previously been
said to constitute the limbs of Vaisvânara. How is this possible?

The teacher Âsmarathya is of opinion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> represents the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as possessing a definite extent, to the end of rendering
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the meditating devotee more definite. That is to say--the
limitation due to the limited extent of heaven, sun, &c. has the purpose
of rendering definite to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> him who pervades (abhi) all this
Universe and in reality transcends all measure (vimâna).--A further
difficulty remains. For what purpose is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> here

The teacher Bâdari thinks that the representation in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the

meditation. 'He who in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> meditates on that Vaisvânara Self as
"prâdesamâtra" and "abhivimâna," he eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in all worlds, in all
beings, in all Selfs.' What this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins is devout <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> for
the purpose of reaching Brahman. 'In this way' means 'as having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span>

intuitional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which abides everywhere and is in
itself of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of supreme bliss. The special kind of food, i.e.
the special objects of enjoyment which belong to the different Selfs
standing under the influence of karman cannot be meant here; for those
limited objects have to be shunned by those who <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> final release. A
further question arises. If Vaisvânara is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, how can the

and so on? (V, 18, 2.) Such a statement has a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only if we
understand by Vaisvânara the intestinal fire.--This difficulty the next
Sûtra elucidates.




32. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of imaginative identification, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Jaimini thinks; for

The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the altar is stated to be the
chest of Vaisvânara, and so on, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to effect an imaginative

meditating devotees and is the means of pleasing Vaisvânara, having the

offering. For the fruit due to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>

33. Moreover, they record him in that.

They (i.e. the Vâjasaneyins) <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of him, viz. Vaisvânara who has
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> for his head, &c.--i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self--as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that, i.e.

Prâna; viz. in the text,'Of that Vaisvânara Self the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> is Sutejas,'
and so on. The context is as follows. The clause 'He who meditates on
the Vaisvânara Self as prâdesamâtra,' &c. enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self having the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> worlds for its body, i.e. on Vaisvânara.
The following clause 'he eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in all worlds' teaches that the
attaining of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the reward of such meditation. And then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
proceeds to teach the Agnihotra offered to Prâna, which is something
subsidiary to the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> taught. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> here establishes an
identity between the members--fire, sun, &c.--of the Vaisvânara enjoined
as <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (which members are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sutejas, Visvarûpa, &c.

worshipper's body. 'The <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> is Sutejas'--that means: the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the
devotee is (identical with) heaven, which is the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

identical with the earth, which constitutes the feet of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
The devotee having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reflected on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, which has the

told to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> his own chest, hair, heart, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and mouth as identical

Agnihotra; further to identify the oblation to Prâna with the Agnihotra,
and by means of this Prâna-agnihotra to win the favour of Vaisvânara, i.
e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The final--conclusion then remains that Vaisvânara
is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, the supreme Person.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'Vaisvânara.'




<span class="t7 hoverable">THIRD</span> PÂDA.

1. The abode of heaven, earth, &c. (is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
terms which are its own.

The followers of the Atharva-veda have the following text, 'He in whom
the heaven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the sky are woven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> also, with all the
vital airs, know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words; he is
the bank (setu) of the Immortal' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5). The doubt here
arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the being spoken of as the abode of heaven, earth, and so
on, is the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.

The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he remarks, in
the next sloka, 'where like spokes in the nave of a wheel the arteries
meet, he moves about within, becoming manifold,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'where' refers
back to the being which in the preceding sloka had been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the abode
of heaven, earth, and so on, the clause beginning with 'where' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
declaring that that being is the basis of the arteries; and the next
clause declares that same being to become manifold or to be <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in many
ways. Now, connexion with the arteries is clearly characteristic of the
individual soul; and so is being <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in many forms, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and so on.
Moreover, in the very sloka under discussion it is said that that being
is the abode of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the five vital airs, and this also is a
characteristic attribute of the individual soul. It being, on these
grounds, ascertained that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> we must
attempt to reconcile therewith, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as we can, what is said about
its being the abode of heaven, earth, &c.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. That which is described
as the abode of heaven, earth, &c. is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a term which is 'its own,' i.e. which specially
belongs to it. The clause we have in <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is 'he is the bank of the
Immortal.' This description applies to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only, which
alone is, in all Upanishads, termed the cause of the attainment of
Immortality; cp. e.g. 'Knowing him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> becomes immortal; there is
no other path to go' (Sve. Up. III, 8). The term 'setu' is derived from
_si_, which means to bind, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> means that which binds, i.e.
makes one to attain immortality; or else it may be understood to mean
that which leads towards immortality that lies beyond the ocean of
samsâra, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as a bank or bridge (setu) leads to the further

under discussion, is also applied to that which is the abode of heaven,
earth, &c.), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any further qualification, primarily denotes

which 'reaches' all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in so far as it rules them. And further
on (II, 2, 7) there are other terms, 'all knowing,' 'all cognising,'

may also be represented as the abode of the arteries; as proved e.g. by
Mahânâr. Up. (XI, 8-12), 'Surrounded by the arteries he hangs ... in the
middle of this pointed flame there dwells the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.' Of that

and freed from name and form.

For the Samsâra <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> consists in the possession of name and form, which
is due to connexion with non-sentient matter, such connexion springing

applicable to the individual soul.




3. Not that which is inferred, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of terms
denoting it, and (so also not) the bearer of the Prânas (i. e. the
individual soul).

As the section under discussion does not treat of the Pradhâna, there
being no terms referring to that, so it is with regard to the individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also.

e. 'inference,' in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'object of inference,' or else ânumânam,
'object of inference'; what is meant being in both cases the Pradhana
inferred to exist by the Sânkhyas.

grief passes away' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 2). This, and similar texts, <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span>
of that one, i.e. the one previously described as the abode of heaven,
earth, &c., as different from the individual soul.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> means--the

Prakriti, the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of fruition. But its grief passes away when it sees
him who is other than itself, i.e. the beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all, and his
greatness which consists in his ruling the entire world.




5. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the subject-matter.

It has been already shown, viz. under I, 2, 21, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
constitutes the initial topic of the Upanishad. And by the arguments <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth in the previous Sûtras of the present Pâda, we have removed all
suspicion as to the topic started being dropped in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the
Upanishad.




6. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of abiding and eating.

'Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them
eats the sweet fruit; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> eating, the other looks on' (Mu. Up. III,
1, 1). This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that one enjoys the fruit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> while the
other, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> enjoying, shining abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the body. Now this
shining being which does not enjoy the fruit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> can only be the
being previously described as the abode of heaven, earth, &c., and
characterised as all knowing, the bridge of immortality, the Self of all;
it can in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be the individual Self which, lamenting, experiences
the results of its works. The settled conclusion, therefore, is that the
abode of heaven, earth, and so on, is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'heaven, earth, and so on.'




7. The bhûman (is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self), as the instruction about it is
additional to that about serenity.

The Chandogas read as follows: 'Where one sees nothing else, hears
nothing else, knows nothing else, that is fulness (bhûman). Where one
sees something else, hears something else, knows something else, that is
the Little' (Ch. Up. VII, 23, 24).

The term 'bhûman' is derived from _bahu_ (much, many), and primarily
signifies 'muchness.' By 'much' in this connexion, we have however to
understand, not what is numerous, but what is large, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> uses
the term in contrast with the 'Little' (alpa), i.e. the 'Small.' And the
being qualified as 'large,' we conclude from the context to be the Self;
for this section of the Upanishad at the outset states that he who knows
the Self overcomes grief (VII, 1, 3), then teaches the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
bhûman, and concludes by saying that 'the Self is all this' (VII, 25, 2).

The question now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> bhûman is the individual
Self or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former view.
For, he says, to Narada who had approached Sanatkumâra with the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
to be instructed about the Self, a series of beings, beginning with
'name' and ending with 'breath,' are enumerated as objects of devout
meditation; Nârada asks each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> there be anything greater than
name, and so on, and each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> receives an affirmative reply ('speech is
greater than name,' &c.); when, however, the series has advanced as far
as Breath, there is no such question and reply. This shows that the
instruction about the Self terminates with Breath, and hence we conclude
that breath in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> means the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is associated
with breath, not a mere modification of air. Also the clauses 'Breath is
father, breath is mother,' &c. (VII, 15, 1), show that breath here is
something intelligent. And this is further proved by the clause 'Slayer
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> father, slayer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> mother,' &c. (VII, 15, 2; 3), which
declares that he who offends a father, a mother, &c., as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as there
is breath in them, really hurts them, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> deserves reproach;
while no blame attaches to him who offers even the grossest violence to
them after their breath has departed. For a conscious being only is
capable of being hurt, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'breath' here denotes such a
being only. Moreover, as it is observed that also in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such
living <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> as have no vital breath (viz. plants), suffering results,
or does not result, according as injury is inflicted or not, we must for
this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also decide that the breath spoken of in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> as
something susceptible of injury is the individual soul. It consequently
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an error to suppose, on the ground of the comparison of Prâna
to the nave of a wheel in which the spokes are set, that Prâna here
denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is incapable of being
injured. That comparison, on the other hand, is quite in its place, if
we understand by Prâna the individual soul, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of
non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> which stands to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the relation
of <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> or instrument of enjoyment, has an <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> dependent on the
individual soul. And this soul, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna, is what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
later on calls Bhûman; for as there is no question and reply as to
something greater than Prâna, Prâna continues, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> break, to be the
subject-matter up to the mention of bhûman. The paragraphs intervening
between the section on Prâna (VII, 15) and the section on the bhûman
(VII, 23 ff.) are to be understood as follows. The Prâna section closes
with the remark that he who fully knows Prâna is an ativâdin, i.e. one
who makes a final supreme declaration. In the next sentence then, 'But
this one in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is an ativâdin who makes a supreme statement by means
of the True,' the clause 'But this one is an ativâdin' refers back to
the previously mentioned <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who knows the Prâna, and the relative
clause 'who makes,' &c., enjoins on him the speaking of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> as an
auxiliary element in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Prâna. The next paragraph, 'When
one understands the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> then one declares the truth,' intimates that
speaking the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> stands in a supplementary relation towards the
cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Prâna as described before. For the
accomplishment of such cognition the subsequent four paragraphs enjoin
reflection, faith, attendance on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> guide, and the due
performance of sacred duties. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that such duties may be
undertaken, the next paragraphs then teach that bliss constitutes the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual soul, previously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna, and finally that
the Bhûman, i.e. the supreme fulness of such bliss, is the proper <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of inquiry. The final purport of the teaching, therefore, is that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual soul, freed from Nescience, is abundant
bliss--a conclusion which perfectly agrees with the initial statement
that he who knows the Self passes beyond sorrow. That being, therefore,
which has the attribute of being 'bhûman,' is the individual Self. This
being so, it is also intelligible why, further on, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
describes the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the individual Self, it uses the term
'I'; for 'I' denotes just the individual Self: 'I am below, I am above,
&c., I am all this' (VII, 25, 1). This conclusion having been settled,
all remaining clauses must be explained so as to agree with it.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The being characterised
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> as 'bhûman' is not the individual Self, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
since instruction is given about the bhûman in addition to 'serenity'
(samprasâda). 'Samprasâda' denotes the individual soul, as we know from
the following text, 'Now that "serenity", having risen from out this
body, and having reached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> light, appears in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> form'
(Ch. Up. VIII, 3, 4). Now in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion instruction is
given about a being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True,' and possessing the attribute of
'bhûman,' as being something additional to the individual soul; and this
being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True' is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. Just as
in the series of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> beginning with name and ending with breath, each
successive being is mentioned in addition to the preceding one--
wherefrom we conclude that it is something really different from what
precedes; so that being also which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True,' and which is
mentioned in addition to the individual Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna, is something
different from the individual Self, and this being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True' is
the same as the Bhûman; in other words, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> teaches that the Bhûman
is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True.' This the Vrittikâra also
declares: 'But the Bhûman only. The Bhûman is Brahman, because in the
series beginning with name instruction is given about it subsequently to
the individual Self.'

But how do we know that the instruction as to 'the True' is in addition
to, and refers to something different from, the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna?--The
text, after having declared that he who knows the Prâna is an ativâdin,
goes on, 'But really that one is an ativâdin who makes a supreme
declaration by means of the True.' The 'but' here clearly separates him
who is an ativâdin by means of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> from the previous ativâdin, and
the clause <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> does not cause us to recognise him who is ativâdin by
means of Prâna; hence 'the True' which is the cause of the latter
ativâdin being what he is must be something different from the Prâna
which is the cause of the former ativâdin's quality.--But we have
maintained above that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins the speaking of 'the True' merely
as an auxiliary duty for him who knows Prâna; and that hence the Prâna
continues to be the general subject-matter!--This contention is
untenable, we reply. The conjunction 'but' shows that the section gives
instruction about a new ativâdin, and does not merely declare that the
ativâdin previously mentioned has to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the truth. It is different
with <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'But that one indeed is an Agnihotrin who speaks the
truth'; there we have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of any further Agnihotrin, and

obligation incumbent on the ordinary Agnihotrin. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under
discussion, on the other hand, we have the term 'the True', which makes
us apprehend that there is a further ativâdin different from the
preceding one; and we know that that term is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman, as e.g. in the text, 'The True, knowledge, the Infinite is
Brahman.' The ativâdin who takes his stand on this Brahman, therefore,
must be viewed as different from the preceding ativâdin; and a
difference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> established on the basis of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> and connexion of

his declaration goes beyond') is one who maintains, as <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his
devotion, something which, as being more beneficial to man, surpasses
other objects of devotion. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> at first declares that he who knows
Prâna, i.e. the individual soul, is an ativâdin, in so far as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of his devout <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> surpasses the objects from name up to hope; and
then goes on to say that, as that <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> also is not of _supreme_
benefit to man, an ativâdin in the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term is he only who
proclaims as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his devotion the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which alone
is of supreme unsurpassable benefit to man. 'He who is an ativâdin by
the True,' i.e. he who is an ativâdin characterised by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his meditation. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the pupil
entreats, 'Sir, may I be an ativâdin with the True!' and the teacher
replies, 'But we must <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know the True!'--Moreover, the text, VII,
26, I, 'Prâna springs from the Self,' declares the origination from the
Self of the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna; and from this we infer that the Self
which is introduced as the general subject-matter of the section, in the
clause 'He who knows the Self passes beyond death,' is different from
the being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna.--The contention that, because there is no
question and answer as to something greater than Prâna, the instruction
about the Self must be supposed to come to an end with the instruction
about Prâna, is by no means legitimate. For that a new subject is
introduced is proved, not only by those questions and answers; it may be
proved by other means also, and we have already explained such means.
The following is the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why the pupil does not ask the question
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> there is anything greater than Prâna. With regard to the non-
sentient objects extending from name to hope--each of which surpasses
the preceding one in so far as it is more beneficial to man--the teacher
does not declare that he who knows them is an ativâdin; when, however,
he comes to the individual soul, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prâna, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

'he who sees this, notes this, understands this is an ativâdin' (VII, 15,
4). The pupil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> imagines that the instruction about the Self is
now completed, and hence asks no further question. The teacher on the
other hand, holding that even that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is not the highest,
spontaneously continues his teaching, and tells the pupil that truly he
only is an ativâdin who proclaims the supremely and absolutely
beneficial being which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the True,' i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.

for granted that the injunction of reflection implies the injunction of
'hearing' the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which is the preliminary for reflecting--
advises him to cherish <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the preliminary means

The attributes also which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> ascribes to the bhûman suit the

not being based on something else ('it rests in its own greatness');
being the Self of all ('the bhûman is below,' &c., 'it is all this');
being that which produces all ('from the Self there springs breath,' &c.
). All these attributes can be reconciled with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.--
The Pûrvapakshin has pointed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which declares the 'I' to be
the Self of all (VII, 25, 1); but what that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> really teaches is

9. The Imperishable (is Brahman), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its supporting that
which is the end of ether.

The Vâjasaneyins, in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> recording the questions asked by Gârgî,
read as follows: 'He said, O Gârgî, the Brâhmanas <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> that the
Imperishable. It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long, it
is not red, not fluid, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a shadow,' &c. (Bri. Up. III, 8, 8).
A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> that Imperishable be the Pradhâna, or the
individual soul, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The Pradhâna, it may be
maintained in the first place. For we see that in passages such as
'higher than that which is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the Imperishable' the term
'Imperishable' actually denotes the Pradhâna; and moreover the qualities
enumerated, viz. not being either coarse or fine, &c., are
characteristic of the Pradhâna.--But, an objection is raised, in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
such as 'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by which the Imperishable is apprehended' (Mu.
Up. I, 1, 5), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Imperishable' is seen to denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman!--In cases, we reply, where the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> may be
determined on the basis either of some other means of proof or of
Scripture, the former <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> presents itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> first, and
hence there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why such <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> should not be accepted.--But
how do you know that the ether of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is not ether in the ordinary
sense?--From the description, we reply, given of it in the text, 'That
above the heavens,' &c. There it is said that all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> past,
present and future rest on ether as their basis; ether cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as that elementary substance which itself is comprised in the
sphere of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> created. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> must understand by 'ether' <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
in its subtle state, i.e. the Pradhâna; and the Imperishable which
thereupon is declared to be the support of that Pradhâna, hence cannot
itself be the Pradhâna.--Nor is there any force in the argument that a
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> established by some other means of proof presents itself to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> more immediately than a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> established by Scripture; for as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'akshara' (i.e. the non-perishable) intimates its <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> directly
through the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of its constituent elements other means of proof
need not be regarded at all.

Moreover Yâjñavalkya had said previously that the ether is the cause and
abode of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> past, present and future, and when Gârgî thereupon
asks him in what that ether 'is woven,' i.e. what is the causal
substance and abode of ether, he replies 'the Imperishable.' Now this
also proves that by the 'Imperishable' we have to understand the
Pradhâna which from other sources is known to be the causal substance,
and hence the abode, of all effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> whatsoever.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The 'Imperishable' is
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares it to support that which
is the end, i. e. that which lies beyond ether, viz. unevolved <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
(avyâkritam). The ether referred to in Gârgî's question is not ether in
the ordinary sense, but what lies beyond ether, viz. unevolved matter,
and hence the 'Imperishable' which is said to be the support of that
'unevolved' cannot itself be the 'unevolved,' i.e. cannot be the
Pradhâna. Let us, then, the Pûrvapakshin resumes, understand by the
'Imperishable,' the individual soul; for this may be viewed as the
support of the entire aggregate of non-sentient matter, inclusive of the
elements in their subtle condition; and the qualities of non-coarseness,
&c., are characteristic of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also. Moreover there are several
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in which the term 'Imperishable' is actually seen to denote the
individual soul; so e.g. 'the non-evolved' is merged in the
'Imperishable'; 'That of which the non-evolved is the body; that of
which the Imperishable is the body'; 'All the creatures are the
Perishable, the non-changing Self is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Imperishable' (Bha. GÎ.
XV, 16).

To this alternative primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra replies.




10. And this (supporting) (springs) from command.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that this supporting of ether and all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
proceeds from command. 'In the command of that Imperishable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon

Person.




11. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the exclusion of (what is of) another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (than

Another nature, i. e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Pradhâna, and so on. A
supplementary <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> excludes difference on the part of the
Imperishable from the supreme Person. 'That Imperishable, O Gârgî, is
unseen but seeing; unheard but hearing; unthought but thinking; unknown
but knowing. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but
it, nothing that thinks but it, nothing that knows but it. In that
Imperishable, O Gârgî, the ether is woven, warp and woof.' Here the
declaration as to the Imperishable being what sees, hears, &c. excludes

12. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his being designated as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of seeing, he (i.e.
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) (is that object).

The followers of the Atharva-veda, in the section containing the
question asked by Satyakâma, read as follows: 'He again who meditates
with this syllable Aum of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Mâtrâs on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, he comes
to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and to the sun. As a snake frees itself from its skin, so he
frees himself from evil. He is led up by the Sâman verses to the Brahma-
world; he sees the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> dwelling in the castle who is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
individual souls concreted with bodies and <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> (than those)' (Pra. Up.
V, 2). Here the terms 'he meditates' and 'he sees' have the same sense,
'seeing' being the result of devout meditation; for according to the
principle expressed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> (Ch. Up. III, 14) 'According as man's

of meditation; and moreover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> exhibits the same object, viz. 'the

The doubt here presents itself <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

former view. For, he argues, on the introductory question, 'He who here

as to agree with that Brahmâ.

To this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra replies that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of seeing is
He, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of designation. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> clearly
designates the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of seeing as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. For the concluding
sloka, which refers to that <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of seeing, declares that 'by means of
the Omkâra he who knows reaches that which is tranquil, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from decay,
immortal, fearless, the highest'--all which attributes properly belong
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, as we know from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'that is the
Immortal, that is the fearless, that is Brahman' (Ch. Up. IV, 15, i).
The qualification expressed in the clause 'etasmâj_ _jîva.--ghanât,' &c.
may also refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, not to Brahmâ Katurmukha; for
the latter is himself comprehended by the term 'jîvaghana.' For that
term denotes all souls which are embodied owing to karman; and that
Katurmukha is one of those we know from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'He who first
creates Brahmâ' (Svet. Up. VI, 18). Nor is there any strength in the
argument that, since the Brahma-world mentioned in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is known to

atmosphere, the being abiding there must needs be Katurmukha. We rather
argue as follows--as from the concluding clause 'that which is tranquil,
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from decay,' &c., we ascertain that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of intuition is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, the Brahma-world spoken of as the abode of the seeing
devotee cannot be the perishable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Brahmâ Katurmukha. A further
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for this conclusion is supplied by what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says about 'him

cannot be the mere abode of Katurmukha. Hence also the concluding sloka
says with reference to that Brahma-world 'that which the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> teach':

He, on the other hand, who meditates on the Pranava as having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

Here terminates the adhikarana of the 'object of seeing.'

(arguments).

The Chandogas have the following text, 'Now in that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
there is the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether. Now

first <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> presenting itself is that the element is meant, for the
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether' is generally <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in that sense; and
because the clause 'what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that small ether' shows that the
ether mentioned constitutes the abode of something else that is to be
enquired into.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The small ether

reasons, contained in clauses of the same section. The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'That
Self which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from evil, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from old age, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from death, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>

true' (VIII, 7, 1) ascribes to that small ether qualities--such as
unconditioned Selfhood, freedom from evil, &c.--which clearly show that
ether to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. And this conclusion is confirmed by
what other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> say about him who knows the small ether attaining the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of realising his own wishes,'Those who depart from hence having

in all worlds'; and 'whatever <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> he desires, by his mere will it
comes to him; having obtained it he is happy' (Ch, Up. VIII, 1, 6; 2, 9).

and all other things.--But, an objection is raised, also on the
alternative of the small ether being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, the comparison
to the universal elemental ether is unsuitable; for scripture explicitly
states that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is (not as large but) larger than
everything else, 'larger than the earth, larger than the sky,' &c. (Ch.
Up. III, 14, 3). Not so, we reply; what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says as to the ether

make a conclusive statement as to its extent but only) to negative that
smallness of the ether which is established by its abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
heart. Similarly we say 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> moves with the speed of an arrow'; the

is merely that he does not move slowly.--But, a further doubt is started,
the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'That Self which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin,' &c. does not appear to
refer back to the small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> makes a

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is the topic of discussion, and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says later on
'That Self, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin, &c. is to be searched out' we must understand
it to refer to the same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of search.--This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be so, we reply,

connexion is as follows.

therein as <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation; and then designates an organ of that

Brahman, i.e. on the one hand, its essential freedom from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

into both these entities?--Listen, attentively, we reply, to our
explanation! The clause 'As large as this ether is, so large is this

For we see it stated in other texts, that all individual souls go daily
to Brahman, viz. in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, 'All these creatures having
become united with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> do not know that they are united with the

'this is the Brahma-world, O King' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 32).--The Sûtra
subjoins a further reason. Even if the going of the souls to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

declares the individual souls to abide in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep
sleep, enjoying freedom from all pain and trouble just as if they were
merged in the pralaya state, is a sufficient 'inferential sign' to prove
that the 'small ether' is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. And similarly the term
'Brahma-world' as exhibited in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion, if understood
as denoting co-ordination (i.e. 'that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which is Brahman'), is
sufficient to prove by itself that the 'small ether'--to which that term
is applied--is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman; it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is needless to appeal
to other passages. That this explanation of 'Brahma-world' is preferable
to the one which understands by Brahma-world 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Brahman' is
proved by considerations similar to those by which the Pû. Mî. Sûtras
prove that 'Nishâda-sthapati' means a headman who at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is a
Nishâda.--Another explanation of the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> under discussion may also
be given. What is said there about all these creatures daily 'going into
the Brahma-world,' may not refer at all to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, but
rather mean that although 'daily going into the Brahman-world,' i. e.
although at all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> moving above the small ether, i. e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which
as the universal Self is everywhere, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> all these creatures not knowing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> do not find, i.e. obtain it; just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> not knowing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
where a treasure is hidden do not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it, although they constantly <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
over it. This constant moving about on the part of ignorant creatures on
the surface, as it were, of the small ether abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> as their
inward Ruler, proves that small ether to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. That
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> as the inner Self of creatures which
dwell in it and are ruled by it, we are told in other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also, so e.g.
in the Antaryâmin-brâhmana. 'He who dwells in the Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Self,
whom the Self does not know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the
Self within; unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing' (Bri. Up. III, 7,
22; 23).--On this interpretation we explain the last part of the Sûtra
as follows. Even if other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> did not refer to it, this daily moving
about on the part of ignorant creatures, on the ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart--
which the comparison with the treasure of gold shows to be the supreme
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of man--, is in itself a sufficient proof for the small ether being
Brahman.

In continuation of the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'It is the Self <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from Sin,' &c.,
which refers to the small ether, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says: 'it is a bank, a

all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be

this specific greatness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which consists in its
supporting the world, is also observed in the small ether--which proves

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether,' moreover, is known to have, among other meanings, that
of Brahman. Compare 'For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if
that ether were not bliss?' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); 'All these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
their rise from the ether' (Ch. Up. I, 9, 1). It has to be kept in <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> 'Brahman' is supported by
what is said about the qualities of the small ether--viz. freedom from
sin, &c.--and hence is stronger than the other meaning--, according to
which âkâsa signifies the elemental ether.

So far the Sûtras have refuted the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the small ether being the
element. They now enter on combating the notion that the small ether may
possibly be the individual soul.




17. If it be said that on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of reference to the other one he is
meant; we say no, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of impossibility.

An objection is raised to the argumentation that, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
complementary passages, the small ether must be explained to mean the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.

For, the objector says, a clear reference to him who is 'other' than the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, i.e. to the individual soul, is contained in the following
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (VIII, 12, 3): 'Thus does that serenity (samprasâda), having
risen from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and approached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> light, appear in its own
form.' 'That is the Self,' he said. 'That is the immortal, the fearless,
this is Brahman' (VIII, 7, 3?). We admit that for the different reasons
stated above the ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> cannot be the elemental ether;
but owing to the force of the intimations conveyed by the complementary
passages just quoted, we must adopt the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that what is meant is the
individual soul. And as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'âkâsa' may be connected with prakâsa
(light), it may be applied to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is

The small ether cannot be the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
because the qualities attributed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> to the former, viz. freedom
from sin, &c., cannot possibly belong to the individual soul.




18. Should it be said that from a subsequent <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (it appears that
the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> is meant); rather (the soul) in so far as its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

The Pûrvapakshin now maintains that we ascertain from a subsequent
declaration made by Prajâpati that it is just the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> that

Indra having <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> that Prajâpati had spoken about a Self <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin,

illustrates the connexion with a body, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the Samsâra state,

different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the sense-organs ('Now where the sight has

Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is never hidden, and which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is
unconditionally characterised by freedom from evil, and so on.--
Moreover, the daharâkâsa-section ascribes to the small ether other
attributes which cannot belong to the individual Self even 'when its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has manifested itself.' The small ether is there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a
bank and support of all worlds; and one of its names,'satyam,' is
explained to imply that it governs all sentient and non-sentient beings.
All this also proves that the small ether is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self. That the individual soul, 'even when its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is manifest,'
cannot be viewed as a bank and support of the worlds, &c., we shall show
under IV, 4.

But if this is so, what then is the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the reference to the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is made in the section treating of the small ether,
viz. in the passage, 'Now that serene being, which after having risen
from this body,' &c. (VIII, 3, 4)?

To this question the next Sûtra replies.




19. And the reference has a different meaning.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> in question declares that the released individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when
reaching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> light, i.e. Brahman, which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all sin,
and so on, attains its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> nature, which is characterised by similar
freedom from sin, and so on. Now this reference to the individual soul,
as described in the teaching of Prajâpati, has the purpose of giving
instruction (not about the qualities of the individual soul, but) about
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that which is the cause of the qualities of the individual
soul, i.e. the qualities specially belonging to the supreme Person. The
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why, in the section containing the teaching of Prajâpati,
information is given as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the released individual

ether. For the individual Self which wishes to reach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> must know

endowed with auspicious qualities, will finally arrive at an intuition
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which is a mass of auspicious qualities raised
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree of excellence. The cognition of the soul's own

Brahman, and the results which are proclaimed in the teaching of
Prajâpati ('He obtains all worlds and all wishes'; 'He moves about there
laughing,' &c.) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> really are results of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the small
ether.




20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of smallness;
that has been explained.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> describes the ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> as being of small compass,
and this agrees indeed with the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which elsewhere is
compared to the point of an awl, but not with Brahman, which is greater
than everything.--The reply to this objection has virtually been given
before, viz. under I, 2, 7, where it is said that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> may be viewed
as of small size, for the purpose of devout meditation.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> remains a settled conclusion that the small ether is none other
but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is untouched by even a shadow of imperfection,
and is an ocean of infinite, supremely exalted, qualities--knowledge,
strength, lordly power, &c. The being, on the other hand, which in the
teaching of Prajâpati is described as first having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> due to karman--
as we see from passages such as 'they strike it as it were, they cut it
as it were'--and as afterwards approaching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> light, and then
manifesting its essential qualities, viz. freedom from sin, &c., is the
individual soul; not the small ether (or Brahman).

The next Sûtra supplies a further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for this conclusion.




21. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the imitation of that.

The individual soul, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from bondage, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> possessing the
qualities of freedom from sin, &c., cannot be the small ether, i.e. the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, because it is stated to 'imitate,' i.e. to be equal to
that Brahman. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> making that statement is Mu. Up. III, 1, 3, 'When
the seer (i.e. the individual soul) sees the brilliant maker, the Lord,
the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who has his source in Brahman; then becoming <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> and shaking
off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, he reaches the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> equality, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from passions.'
The being to which the teaching of Prajâpati refers is the 'imitator,' i.
e. the individual soul; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is 'imitated' is the small
ether.




22. The same is declared by Smriti also.

Smriti also declares that the transmigrating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when reaching the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release 'imitates,' i.e. attains supreme equality of attributes
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. 'Abiding by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> they, attaining to
equality of attributes with me, are not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> again at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
creation, nor are they affected by the general dissolution of the world'
(Bha. Gî. XIV, 2).

Some maintain that the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras constitute a separate adhikarana
(head of discussion), meant to prove that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> Mu. Up. II, 2, 10

inadmissible, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted no

concerned with Brahman; and it further having been shown under I, 1, 24
ff., that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is apprehended under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of light.--The
interpretation moreover does not fit in with the wording of the Sûtras.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of the 'small one.'




23. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the term, the one measured.

We read in the Kathavallî 'The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> of the size of a thumb stands in
the middle of the Self, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of the past and the future, and

(Ka. Up. II, 4, 1; 13). And 'The <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> not
larger than a thumb, the inner Self, is always settled in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of
men' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 17). A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the being measured
by the extent of a span be the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The
Pûrvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, another scriptural

of the vital airs moves through his own works, of the size of a thumb,
brilliant like the sun, endowed with purposes and egoity' (Svet. Up. V,
7; 8). Moreover, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is not anywhere else, not even for the

individual Self, we understand the term 'Lord,' which is applied to it,

objects and the instruments of fruition.--Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra
disposes, maintaining that the being a thumb <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> can be none but the

For lordship over all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
past and future cannot possibly belong to the individual Self, which is
under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of karman.--But how can the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self be said to have
the measure of a thumb?--On this point the next Sûtra satisfies us.




24. But with reference to the heart, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> being qualified.

In so far as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self abides, for the purpose of devout
meditation, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of the devotee--which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is of the measure
of a thumb--it may itself be viewed as having the measure of a thumb.
The individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also can be said to have the measure of a thumb only
in so far as dwelling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart; for scripture directly states
that its real size is that of the point of a goad, i.e. minute. And as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> only are capable of devout meditation, and hence alone have a claim
on scripture, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the hearts of other living creatures also,
such as donkeys, horses, snakes, &c., have the same size, cannot give
rise to any objection.--The discussion of this <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> will be completed
later on [FOOTNOTE 326:1].




25. Also <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> above them (i.e. men), Bâdarâyana thinks, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
possibility.

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to prove that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> may be viewed as having the
size of a thumb, it has been declared that the scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
enjoining <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> are the concern of men. This offers an
opportunity for the discussion of the question <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> also other
classes of individual souls, such as devas, are qualified for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of Brahman. The Pûrvapakshin denies this qualification in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and other beings, on the ground of absence of capability. For, he
says, bodiless beings, such as gods, are incapable of the accomplishment
of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman, which requires as its auxiliaries the seven
means enumerated above (p. 17)--This must not be objected to on the
ground of the devas, and so on, having bodies; for there is no means of
proof establishing such embodiedness. We have indeed proved above that
the Vedânta-texts may intimate accomplished things, and hence are an
authoritative means for the cognition of Brahman; but we do not meet
with any Vedânta-text, the purport of which is to teach that the devas,
and so on, possess bodies. Nor can this point be established through
mantras and arthavâda texts; for these are merely supplementary to the
injunctions of actions (sacrificial, and so on), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have a
different aim. And the injunctions themselves prove nothing with regard
to the devas, except that the latter are that with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to which those
actions are performed. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> it also cannot be shown that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> have any desires or wants (to fulfil or supply which they might
enter on <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of Brahman). For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> reasons above we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
conclude that the devas, and so on, are not qualified for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
Brahman.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is contradicted by the Sûtra. Such <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is
possible in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> also Bâdarâyana thinks; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
of the possibility of want and capacity on their part also. Want and
wish exist in their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> since they also are liable to suffering,
springing from the assaults, hard to be endured, of the different kinds
of pain, and since they also know that supreme enjoyment is to be found
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, which is untouched by the shadow even of
imperfection, and is a mass of auspicious qualities in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
perfection. 'Capability', on the other hand, depends on the possession
of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and sense-organs of whatever degree of tenuity; and that the
devas, from Brahma downward, possess a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and sense-organs, is
declared in all the Upanishads, in the chapters treating of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and
the chapters enjoining meditation. In the Chândogya, e.g. it is related
how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being having resolved on creation, evolved the aggregate
of non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> with its different kinds, and then produced the
fourfold multitude of living creatures, each having a material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
corresponding to its karman, and a suitable name of its own. Similarly,
all the other scriptural accounts of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> declare that there are
four classes of creatures--devas, men, animals, and non-moving beings,
such as plants--and the difference of these classes depends on the
individual Selfs being joined to various bodies capacitating them to
experience the results of their works, each in that one of the fourteen
worlds--beginning with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Brahmâ--which is the suitable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
for retribution. For in themselves, apart from bodies, the individual
Selfs are not distinguished as men, gods, and so on. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the
story of the devas and Asuras approaching Prajâpati with fuel in their
hands, staying with him as pupils for thirty-two years, &c. (Ch. Up.
VIII, 7 ff.), clearly shows that the devas possess bodies and sense-
organs. Analogously, mantras and arthavâdas, which are complementary to
injunctions of works, contain unmistakeable references to the corporeal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> ('Indra holding in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the thunderbolt'; 'Indra
lifted the thunderbolt', &c.); and as the latter is not contradicted by
any other means of proof it must be accepted on the authority stated.
Nor can it be said that those mantras and arthavâdas are really meant to
express something else (than those details mentioned above), in so far,
namely, as they aim at proclaiming or glorifying the action with which
they are connected; for those very details subserve the purpose of
glorification, and so on, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> them glorification is not possible.
For we praise or glorify a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> by declaring its qualities; if such
qualities do not exist all glorification lapses. It cannot by any means
be maintained that anything may be glorified by the proclamation of its
qualities, even if such qualities do not really exist. Hence the
arthavâdas which glorify a certain action, just thereby intimate the
real <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the qualities and details of the action. The mantras
again, which are prescribed in connexion with the actions, serve the
purpose of throwing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to be derived from the performance
of the actions, and this they accomplish by making statements as to the
particular qualities, such as embodiedness and the like, which belong to
the devas and other classes of beings. Otherwise Indra, and so on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
not be remembered at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of performance; for the idea of a divinity
presents itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> only in connexion with the special
attributes of that divinity. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such qualities as are not
established by other means of proof, the primary statement is made by
the arthavâda or the mantra: the former thereby glorifies the action,
and the latter proclaims it as possessing certain qualities or details;
and both these ends are accomplished by making statements as to the gods,
&c., possessing certain qualities, such as embodiedness and the like.
In the case, again, of certain qualities being already established by
other means of proof, the mantras and arthavâdas merely refer to them
(as something already known), and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> perform their function of
glorification and elucidation. And where, thirdly, there is a
contradiction between the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and what mantras and
arthavâdas <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> (as when, e.g. a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the latter kind says that 'the
sacrificial post is the sun'), the intention of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is
metaphorically to denote, by means of those apparently unmeaning terms,
certain other qualities which are not excluded by the other means of
knowledge; and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the function of glorification and elucidation
is again accomplished. Now what the injunction of a sacrificial action
demands as its supplement, is a statement as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the
divinity to whom the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is offered; for the performance which
scripture enjoins on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> desirous of certain results, is itself of a
merely transitory nature, and hence requires some agent capable of
bringing about, at some future time, the result desired as, e.g. the
heavenly world. 'Vâyu is the swiftest god; he (the sacrificer)
approaches Vâyu with his own share; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> then leads him to
prosperity' (Taitt. Samh. I, 2, 1); 'What he seeks by means of that
offering, may he obtain that, may he prosper therein, may the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
favourably grant him that' (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 10, 5); these and similar
arthavâdas and mantras intimate that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> when propitiated by
certain sacrificial works, give certain rewards and possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to
do so; and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> connect themselves with the general context of
scripture as supplying an evidently required item of information.
Moreover, the mere verb 'to sacrifice' (yaj), as denoting worship of the
gods, intimates the presence of a deity which is to be propitiated by
the action <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> sacrifice, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> constitutes the main element of
that action. A careful consideration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> context <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> reveals
that everything which is wanted for the due accomplishment of the action
enjoined is to be learned from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> itself, and that hence we need
not have recourse to such entities as the 'unseen principle' (apûrva),
assumed to be denoted by, or to be imagined in connexion with, the
passages enjoining certain actions. Hence the dharmasâstras, itihâsas,
and purânas also, which are founded on the different brâhmanas, mantras
and arthavâdas, clearly teach that Brahma and the other gods, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
the Asuras and other superhuman beings, have bodies and sense-organs,
constitutions of different kinds, different abodes, enjoyments, and
functions.--Owing to their having bodies, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are also
qualified for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman.

26. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny
this, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the observation of the assumption of several
(bodies).

An objection here presents itself. If we admit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to have bodies,
a difficulty arises at the sacrifices, as it is impossible that one and
the same corporeal Indra--who is at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> invited by many
sacrificers 'come, O Indra', 'come, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the red horses,' &c.--
should be present at all those places. And that the gods, <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and so on,
really do come to the sacrifices is proved by the following scriptural
text: 'To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> do the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> go, and to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> not? He who first
receives the gods, sacrifices to them on the following day' (Taitt. Samh.
I, 6, 7, 1). In refutation of this objection the Suûtra points out that
there is seen, i.e. recorded, the assumption of several bodies at the
same time, on the part of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> endowed with special powers, such as
Saubhari.




27. If it be said (that a contradiction will result) with regard to
words; we say no, since <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> originate from them (as appears) from
perception and inference.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> then let us admit that there is no difficulty as far as sacrifices
are concerned, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> stated in the preceding Sûtra. But another
difficulty presents itself with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of which the Veda
consists. For if Indra and the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are corporeal beings, it
follows that they are made up of parts and hence non-permanent. This
implies either that the Vedic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting them--not differing therein
from common worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as Devadatta--are totally devoid of
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> during all those periods which precede the origination of the
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indra and so on, or follow on their destruction; or else
that the Veda itself is non-permanent, non-eternal.--This objection is
not valid, the Sûtra points out, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that those beings, viz.
Indra and so on, again and again originate from the Vedic words. To
explain. Vedic words, such as Indra and so on, do not, like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
Devadatta and the like, denote, on the basis of convention, one
particular individual only: they rather denote by their own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
particular species of beings, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'cow' denotes a
particular species of animals. When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> a special individual of
the class <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indra has perished, the creator, apprehending from the
Vedic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Indra' which is present to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the class
characteristics of the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> denoted by that word, creates another
Indra possessing those very same characteristics; just as the potter
fashions a new jar, on the basis of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'jar' which is stirring in
_his_ mind.--But how is this known?--'Through perception and inference,'
i.e. through Scripture and Smriti. Scripture says, e.g. 'By means of the
Veda Prajâpati evolved names and forms, the being and the non-being';
and 'Saying "bhûh" (earth) he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the earth; saying "bhuvah" he
<span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the air,' and so on; which passages teach that the creator at
first bethinks himself of the characteristic make of a thing, in
connexion with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> denoting it, and thereupon creates an individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> characterised by that make. Smriti makes similar statements;
compare, e. g. 'In the beginning there was sent forth by the creator,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> speech--beginningless and endless--in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Veda, and
from it there originated all creatures'; and 'He, in the beginning,
separately <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Veda the names and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> and
shapes of all things'; and 'The names and forms of beings, and all the
multiplicity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> He in the beginning <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> from the Veda.' This
proves that from the corporeality of the gods, and so on, it follows
neither that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Veda are unmeaning nor that the Veda
itself is non-eternal.




28. And for this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> eternity (of the Veda).

As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> such as Indra and Vasishtha, which denote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and Rishis,
denote (not individuals only, but) classes, and as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of those
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is preceded by their being suggested to the creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> through
those words; for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the eternity of the Veda admits of being
reconciled with what scripture says about the mantras and kândas
(sections) of the sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> having 'makers' and about Rishis seeing
the hymns; cp. such passages as 'He chooses the makers of mantras';
'Reverence to the Rishis who are the makers of mantras'; 'That is Agni;
this is a <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> of Visvâmitra.' For by means of these very <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
Prajâpati presents to his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the characteristics and powers of the
different Rishis who make the different sections, hymns, and mantras,
thereupon creates them endowed with those characteristics and powers,
and appoints them to remember the very same sections, hymns, &c. The
Rishis being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> gifted by Prajâpati with the requisite powers, undergo
suitable preparatory austerities and finally _see_ the mantras, and so
on, proclaimed by the Vasishthas and other Rishis of former ages of the
world, perfect in all their sounds and accents, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having learned
them from the recitation of a teacher. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no conflict between
the eternity of the Veda and the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Rishis are the _makers_
of its sections, hymns, and so on. A further objection is raised. Let it
be admitted that after each pralaya of the kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'contingent'
(naimittika), Prajâpati may proceed to create new Indras, and so on, in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of remembering on the basis of the Veda the Indras, and so on,
of preceding periods. In the case, on the other hand, of a pralaya of
the kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> elemental (prâkritika), in which the creator, Prajâpati
himself, and words--which are the effects of the elemental ahankâra--
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away, what possibility is there of Prajâpati undertaking a new
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> on the basis of Vedic words, and how can we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the
permanency of a Veda which perishes? He who maintains the eternity of
the Veda and the corporeality of gods, and so on, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> really driven
to the hypothesis of the course of mundane <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a
beginning (i.e. not preceded by a pralaya).--Of this difficulty the next
Sûtra disposes.




29. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the equality of names and forms there is no
contradiction, even in the renovation (of the world); as appears from--
Sruti and Smriti.

On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the sameness of names and forms, as stated before, there
is no difficulty in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the origination of the world, even in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of total pralayas. For what actually takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is as follows.
When the period of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pralaya draws towards its close, the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

the pralaya, and forming the volition 'May I become manifold' separates
into its constituent elements the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> mass of enjoying souls and
objects of enjoyment which, during the pralaya state, had been merged in
him so as to possess a separate <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (not actual but) potential
only, and then emits the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> just as it had been before, from
the so-called Mahat down to the Brahman-egg, and Hiranyagarbha
(Prajâpati). Having thereupon manifested the Vedas in exactly the same

Hiranyagarbha, he entrusts to him the new <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the different
classes of beings, gods, and so on, just as it was before; and at the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> abides himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> so <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> as its inner Self
and Ruler. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the process removes all difficulties. The
superhuman origin and the eternity of the Veda really mean that
intelligent agents having received in their minds an impression due to
previous recitations of the Veda in a fixed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of words, chapters,
and so on, remember and again recite it in that very same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
succession. This holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> both with regard to us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and to the

cases that the representations of the Veda which the supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span>

previously made.

To the question whence all this is known, the Sûtra replies 'from
Scripture and Smriti.' The scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is 'He who first creates
Brahmâ and delivers the Vedas to him' (Svet. Up. VI, 18). And as to
Smriti we have the following statement in Manu, 'This universe existed
in the shape of darkness, &c.--He desiring to produce <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of many
kinds from his own body, first with a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the waters and
placed his seed in them. That seed became a golden egg equal to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
in brilliancy; in that he himself was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as Brahmâ, the progenitor of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world' (Manu I, 5; 8-9). To the same effect are the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of
the Paurânikas, 'From the navel of the sleeping divinity there sprung up
a lotus, and in that lotus there was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> Brahma fully knowing all Vedas
and Vedângas. And then Brahmâ was told by him (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Divinity),
'Do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> create all beings, O Great-minded one'; and the following
passage, 'From the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Nârâyana there was <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> the Four-faced one.'--
And in the section which begins 'I will tell the original creation,' we
read 'Because having <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (nâra) I abide <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
my name shall be Nârâyana. There I lie asleep in every Kalpa, and as I
am sleeping there springs from my navel a lotus, and in that lotus there
is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> the Four-faced one, and I tell him "Do thou, Great-minded one,
create all beings."'--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the deities.'




30. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility (of qualification for the
madhuvidyâ, &c.) (Jaimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods,
&c.).)

So far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself
for consideration, viz. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are qualified or not to
undertake those meditations of which they themselves are the objects.
The Sûtra states as a pûrvapaksha <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> held by Jaimini, that they are
not so qualified, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that there are no other Âdityas, Vasus,
and so on, who could be meditated on by the Âdityas and Vasus themselves;
and that moreover for the Âdityas and Vasus the qualities and position
of those classes of deities cannot be objects of desire, considering
that they possess them already. The so-called Madhuvidyâ (Ch. Up. III)
represents as objects of devout <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> certain parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
which are being enjoyed by the different classes of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings, Vasus,
Âdityas, and so on--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> being there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'madhu.' i.e. honey or
nectar, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his being the abode of a certain nectar to be
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by certain sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> to be known from the Rig-veda,
and so on; and as the reward of such <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> names the
attainment of the position of the Vasus, Âdityas, and so on.




31. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the
Light.

'Him the devas meditate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of lights, as immortal time'
(Bri. Up. IV, 4, 16). This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the Light, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. Now this express
declaration as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> being meditating devotees with regard to

denial of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> being qualified for meditations on other objects. The
conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the Vasus, and so on, are not qualified for
meditations on the Vasus and other classes of deities.




32. But Bâdarâyana (maintains) the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (of qualification); for
there is (possibility of such).

The Reverend Bâdarâyana thinks that the Âdityas, Vasus, and so on, are
also qualified for meditations on divinities. For it is in their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
also possible that their attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> should be viewed as
preceded by their attainment of Vasu-hood or Âditya-hood, in so far,
namely, as they meditate on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> themselves. They
may be Vasus and Âdityas in the present age of the world, but at the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> be desirous of holding the same position in future ages also.
In the Madhuvidyâ we have to distinguish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sections, concerned
respectively with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its causal and its effected state. The
former section, extending from the beginning up to 'when from thence he
has risen upwards,' enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its condition as
effect, i.e. as appearing in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of creatures such as the Vasus,
and so on; while the latter section enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the causal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> viewed as abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> as its inner Self. The purport
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> vidyâ is that he who meditates on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in this its

Brahman. From the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the text, 'And indeed to him who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows

there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> once and for all,' calls the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Madhuvidyâ a 'Brahma'--
upanishad, and that the reward declared is the attainment of Vasu-hood,
and so on, leading up to the attainment of Brahman, we clearly are
entitled to infer that the meditations which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins, viz. on
the different parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> viewed as objects of enjoyment for the
Vasus, and so on, really are meant as meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as abiding
in those different forms. <span class="t25 hoverable">Meditation</span> on the Vasus and similar <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> seen to be possible for the Vasus themselves. And as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> really
constitutes the only <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation, we also see the
appropriateness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> discussed above, 'On him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> meditate

there is possibility with regard to the Madhu-vidyâ, and so on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
only being the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> everywhere.'--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'honey.'

The Sûtras now enter on a discussion of the question <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Sûdras
also are qualified for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.

The Pûrvapakshin maintains that they are so qualified; for qualification,
he says, depends on want and capacity, and both these are possible in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Sûdras also. The Sûdra is not indeed qualified for any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
depending on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the sacred fires, for from such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> he
is debarred; but he possesses qualification for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman,
which after all is nothing but a certain mental energy. The only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
prerequisite for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> are those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> which are incumbent on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
as a member of a caste or âsrama, and these consist, in the Sûdra's case,
in obedience to the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> castes. And when we read 'therefore the Sûdra
is not qualified for sacrifices,' the purport of this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is only to
make a confirmatory reference to something already settled by reason,
viz. that the Sûdra is not qualified for the performance of sacrifices
which cannot be accomplished by one not acquainted with the sacred fires
(and not to deny the Sûdra's competence for devout meditation).--But how
can <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> be undertaken by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has not studied the

allow Sûdras to become acquainted with <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of that kind; cp. e.g. 'one

Moreover, those Purânas and Itihâsas make mention of Sûdras, such as
Vidura, who had a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. And the Upanishads themselves,
viz. in the so-called Samvarga-vidyâ, show that a Sûdra is qualified for
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman; for there the teacher Raikva addresses
Jânasruti, who wishes to learn from him, as Sûdra, and thereupon
instructs him in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (Ch. Up. IV, 2, 3). All this
proves that Sûdras also have a claim to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.

This conclusion we deny, on the ground of the absence of capability. It
is impossible that the capability of performing meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
should belong to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> not knowing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the due
modes of meditation, and not qualified by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the requisite
preliminaries of such meditation, viz. recitation of the Veda,
sacrifices, and so on. Mere want or <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> does not impart qualification
to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> destitute of the required capability. And this absence of
capability is due, in the Sûdra's case, to absence of legitimate study
of the Veda. The injunctions of sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> naturally connect

ceremonies and the like) that belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> castes, for

sacrifices), owing to their studying the Veda in agreement with the
injunction which prescribes such study for the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> castes; the same
injunctions do not, on the other hand, connect themselves with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> belonging to others (than members of

And the same naturally holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard

study supplies a means for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman, it follows that the
Sûdra for whom that injunction is not meant is incapable of such
meditation. Itihâsas and Purânas hold the position of being helpful
means towards <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in so far only as they confirm or support the
Veda, not independently of the Veda. And that Sûdras are allowed to hear
Itihâsas and Purânas is meant only for the end of destroying their sins,
not to prepare them for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Vidura and
other Sûdras having been 'founded on Brahman,' explains itself as
follows:--Owing to the effect of former actions, which had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

(On these general grounds we <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to Sûdras being viewed as qualified
for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman.) The Sûtra now refutes that argument, which
the Pûrvapakshin derives from the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Sûdra' in the

33. (That) grief of him (arose), this is intimated by his (Jânasruti's)
resorting to him (Raikva) on hearing a disrespectful speech about
himself.

From what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says about Jânasruti Pautrâyana having been taunted
by a flamingo for his want of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, and having thereupon
resorted to Raikva, who possessed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, it appears
that sorrow (suk) had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> possession of him; and it is with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to
this that Raikva addresses him as Sûdra. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Sûdra,
etymologically considered, means one who grieves or sorrows (sokati).
The appellation 'sûdra' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> refers to his sorrow, not to his being
a member of the fourth caste. This clearly appears from a consideration
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> story. Jânasruti Pautrâyana was a very liberal and pious
king. Being much pleased with his virtuous life, and wishing to rouse in
him the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of knowing Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> noble-minded beings, assuming the
shape of flamingoes, flew past him at night time, when one of them
addressed the other, 'O Bhallâksha. the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Jânasruti has spread
like the sky; do not go near that it may not burn thee.' To this praise
of Jânasruti the other flamingo replied, 'How can you <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of him,
being what he is, as if he were Raikva "sayuktvân"?' i.e. 'how can you

very pious, but as he does not know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> what quality of his could
produce splendour capable of burning me like the splendour of Raikva?'
The former flamingo thereupon asks who that Raikva is, and its companion
replies, 'He in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> there are comprised all the

flamingo--which implied a reproach to himself as being destitute of the

perceives that Jânasruti is inwardly grieved at the slighting speech of
the flamingo, which had been provoked by the king's want of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

intimating that Raikva knows Jânasruti to be plunged in grief, and on
that <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> fit to receive instruction about Brahman. Jânasruti
thereupon approaches Raikva for a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> time, bringing as much wealth
as he possibly can, and moreover his own daughter. Raikva again
intimates his <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the pupil's fitness for receiving instruction by
addressing him a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as 'Sûdra,' and says, 'You have <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
these, O Sûdra; by this mouth only you made me speak,' i.e. 'You now

appellation 'sûdra' is meant to intimate the grief of Jânasruti--which
grief in its turn indicates the king's fitness for receiving instruction;
and is not meant to declare that Jânasruti belongs to the lowest caste.




34. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (Jânasruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood.

The first section of the vidyâ tells us that Jânasruti bestowed much
wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper
on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages--
which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances
suggest Jânasruti's being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the
lowest caste.--The above Sûtra having declared that the kshattriya-hood
of Jânasruti is indicated in the introductory legend, the next Sûtra
shows that the same circumstance is indicated in the concluding legend.




35. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the inferential sign further on, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with
Kaitraratha.

The kshattriya-hood of Jânasruti is further to be accepted on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the Kshattriya Abhipratârin Kaitraratha, who is mentioned further on in
this very same Samvargavidyâ which Raikva imparts to Jânasruti.--But why?--
As follows. The section beginning 'Once a Brahmakârin begged of Saunaka
Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni while being waited on at their meal,'
and ending 'thus do we, O Brahmakârin, meditate on that being,' shows
Kâpeya, Abhipratârin, and the Brahmakârin to be connected with the
Samvarga-vidyâ. Now Abhipratârin is a Kshattriya, the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are
Brâhmanas. This shows that there are connected with the vidyâ, Brâhmanas,
and from among non-Brâhmanas, a Kshattriya only, but not a Sûdra. It
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> appears appropriate to infer that the person, other than the
Brâhmana Raikva, who is likewise connected with this vidyâ, viz.
Jânasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a Sûdra.--But how do we know
that Abhipratârin is a Kaitraratha and a Kshattriya? Neither of these
circumstances is stated in the legend in the Samvarga-vidyâ! To this
question the Sûtra replies, 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the inferential mark.' From
the inferential mark that Saunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni are
said to have been sitting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> at a meal we understand that there is
some connexion between Abhipratârin and the Kâpeyas. Now another
scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> runs as follows: 'The Kâpeyas made Kaitraratha
perform that sacrifice' (Tând Brâ. XX, 12, 5), and this shows that one
connected with the Kâpeyas was a Kaitraratha; and a further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> shows
that a Kaitraratha is a Kshattriya. 'from him there was descended a
Kaitraratha who was a prince.' All this favours the inference that
Abhipratârin was a Kaitraratha and a Kshattriya.

So far the Sûtras have shown that there is no inferential mark to prove
what is contradicted by reasoning, viz. the qualification of the Sûdras.
The next Sûtra declares that the non-qualification of the Sûdra proved
by reasoning is confirmed by Scripture and Smriti.




36. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the reference to ceremonial purifications, and on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the declaration of their absence.

In sections the purport of which is to give instruction about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
the ceremony of initiation is referred to, 'I will initiate you; he
initiated him' (Ch. Up. IV, 4). And at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the absence of such
ceremonies in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Sûdras is stated: 'In the Sûdra there is not
any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony' (Manu X, 126); and 'The
fourth caste is once born, and not fit for any ceremony' (Manu X, 4).




37. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-
being of that.

That a Sûdra is not qualified for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> appears from that
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> also that as soon as Gautama has convinced himself that Jâbâla, who
wishes to become his pupil, is not a Sûdra, he proceeds to teach him the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.




38. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and
performance of (Vedic) matter.

The Sûdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to
perform the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> enjoined in it. 'For a Sûdra is like a cemetery,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a Sûdra;'
'Therefore the Sûdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.' And he who
does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand and
perform what the Veda enjoins. The prohibition of hearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> implies
the prohibition of understanding and whatever depends on it.




39. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Smriti.

Smriti also declares this prohibition of hearing, and so on. 'The ears
of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac; if
he pronounces it his tongue is to be slit; if he preserves it his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is to be cut through.' And 'He is not to teach him sacred duties or vows.
'--It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> a settled <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that the Sûdras are not qualified for
meditations on Brahman.

We must here point out that the non-qualification of Sûdras for the
cognition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> can in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be asserted by those who hold that a

herein differ from that of the Brâhmana; the latter also does not at

obstructive imagination of plurality; for in the same way, i.e. helped
by meditation, the non-Vedic instruction given by another <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
produces the required cognition in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the Sûdra. For <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
means nothing but a steady consideration of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> which sentences
declaratory of the unity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the Self may convey, and the
effect of such <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is to destroy all impressions opposed to such
unity; you yourself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> admit that the injunction of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> aims at
something visible (i.e. an effect that can be definitely assigned,
whence it follows that the Sûdra also is qualified for it, while he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be qualified for an activity having an 'adrishta,' i.e.

Veda also and the like (are not indispensable means for bringing about
cognition of Brahman, but) merely subserve the origination of the _desire_
of knowledge. The <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> may arise in a Sûdra also (viz. in
some other way), and thereupon real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> may result from non-Vedic
instruction, obstructive imaginations having previously been destroyed
by meditation. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> in his <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> also non-real bondage will come to
an end.--The same conclusion may also be arrived at by a different road.
The mere ordinary instruments of knowledge, viz. perception and
inference assisted by reasoning, may suggest to the Sûdra the theory
that there is an inward Reality constituted by non-differenced self-
luminous intelligence, that this inward principle witnesses Nescience,
and that owing to Nescience the entire apparent world, with its manifold
distinctions of knowing subjects and objects of knowledge, is
superimposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the inner Reality. He may thereupon, by uninterrupted
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on this inner Reality, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> himself from all imaginations
opposed to it, arrive at the intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the inner principle,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> obtain final release. And this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> being open to release, there
is really no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to be discerned in the Vedânta-texts, suggesting as
they clearly do the entirely false <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that the real being (is not
absolutely homogeneous intelligence, but) possesses infinite
transcendent attributes, being endowed with manifold powers, connected
with manifold creations, and so on. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the qualification of

also by Brâhmanas and members of the other <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> castes, the poor

possibly be raised. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> being implicated in and confused by the
beginningless course of mundane existence, requires to receive from
somewhere a suggestion as to this empirical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> being a mere error and
the Reality being something quite different, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> only there arises
in him a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to enter on an enquiry, proceeding by means of
perception, and so on. Now that which gives the required suggestion is
the Veda, and hence we cannot do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it.--But this objection is not
valid. For in the minds of those who are awed by all the dangers and
troubles of existence, the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to enter on a philosophical
investigation of Reality, proceeding by means of Perception and
Inference, springs up quite apart from the Veda, owing to the
observation that there are various sects of philosophers. Sânkhyas, and
so on, who make it their business to carry on such investigations. And
when such <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> is once roused, Perception and Inference alone (in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> allowed by the Sânkaras themselves) lead on to the theory that the
only Reality is <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> eternal, pure, self-luminous, non-dual, non-
changing, and that everything else is fictitiously superimposed thereon.
That this self-luminous Reality possesses no other attribute to be
learned from scripture is admitted; for according to your opinion also
scripture sublates everything that is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and merely

the Upanishads for the purpose of establishing that the Real found in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of perception and inference is at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
bliss; for the merely and absolutely Intelligent is seen of itself to be
of that nature, since it is different from everything that is not of
that nature.--There are, on the other hand, those who hold that the

assisted by the seven means (see above, p. 17); and that the supreme

the non-qualification of the Sûdra, as given in the preceding Sûtras,
holds good.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the exclusion of the
Sûdras.'

so on.

We read in the Chândogya. 'The ether is the evolver of forms and names.

the released individual soul, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The Pûrvapakshin
adopts the former view. For, he says, the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is introduced as
subject-matter in an immediately preceding clause,'Shaking off all as a
horse shakes his hair, and as the moon frees himself from the mouth of
Râhu; having shaken off the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> I obtain, satisfied, the uncreated

And 'the evolver of names and forms' is again that same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
characterised with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to its previous condition; for the individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its non-released <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> supported the shapes of gods, and so on,
and their names. With a view, finally, to its present <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> in which it
is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from name and form, the last clause declares 'that is Brahman,
the Immortal'. The term 'ether' may very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be applied to the released

But, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion is supplementary to the section
dealing with the small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> (VIII, 1, 1 ff.), we
understand that that small ether is referred to here also; and it has
been proved above that that small ether is Brahman!--Not so, we reply.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion is separated from the section treating of the
small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, by the teaching of Prajâpati. and that
teaching is concerned with the characteristics of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in
its different conditions up to Release; and moreover the earlier part of
the section under discussion speaks of the being which shakes off evil,
and this undoubtedly is the released individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> introduced in the
teaching of Prajâpati. All this shows that the ether in our <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
denotes the released individual soul.

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The ether in our <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, because the clause 'Ether is the evolver of forms and
names' designates something other than the individual soul. The ether
which evolves names and forms cannot be the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> either in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage or that of release. In the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is under the influence of karman, itself participates in name and
form, and hence cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about names and forms. And in its released
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it is expressly said not to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> part in the world-business (Ve.
Sû. IV, 4, 17), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is all the less qualified to evolve names
and forms. The Lord, on the other hand, who is the ruling principle in
the construction of the Universe is expressly declared by scripture to
be the evolver of names and forms; cp. 'Entering into them with this
living Self, let me evolve names and forms' (Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2); 'Who is
all-knowing, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> brooding consists of knowledge, from him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> this
Brahman, name, form, and matter' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9), &c. Hence the ether
which brings about names and forms is something different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
for which name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about; it is in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman. This the next clause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> confirms, 'That which is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> those forms and names'; the purport of which is: because that
ether is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> names and forms, not being touched by them but being
something apart, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it is the evolver of them; this also
following from his being <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and endowed with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
realising his purposes. The 'and so on' in the Sûtra refers to the
Brahma-hood, Self-hood, and immortality mentioned in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> ('That is
the Brahman, the Immortal, the Self'). For Brahma-hood, i.e. greatness,
and so on, in their unconditioned sense, belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> clear that the ether is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.--Nor is the
Pûrvapakshin right in maintaining that a clause immediately preceding
('shaking off all evil') introduces the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as the general

preceding the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> under discussion does introduce as general topic,
is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, as shown by the clause 'I obtain the Brahma-

evolver of names and forms, &c., we must conclude that it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

the term 'ether' prompts us to recognise here the small ether (mentioned
in the first section of the eighth book) as the general topic of the
book; and as the teaching of Prajâpati is meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth (not the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> by itself but) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the meditating
devotee, it is proper to conclude that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion is
meant finally to represent, as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be obtained, the small
ether previously inculcated as <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation. In conclusion we
remark that the term 'ether' is nowhere seen to denote the individual
Self.--The ether that evolves names and forms, therefore, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman.

But, an objection is raised, there is no other Self different from the
individual Self; for scripture teaches the unity of all Selfs and denies
duality. Terms such as 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,' 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman,' 'the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Lord,' are merely designations of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release. The Brahma-world to be attained, therefore, is nothing
different from the attaining individual soul; and hence the ether also
that evolves names and forms can be that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only.--To this objection
the next Sûtra replies.




43. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference in deep sleep and departing.

We have to supply 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of designation' from the preceding Sûtra.
Because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> designates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as something different from
the individual Self in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
departure, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> different. For the Vâjasaneyaka,
after having introduced the individual Self in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'Who is that
Self?--He who consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is among the prânas,' &c. (_Bri_.
Up. IV, 3, 7), describes how, in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, being not
conscious of anything it is held embraced by the all-knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self, embraced by the intelligent Self it knows nothing that is without,
nothing that is within' (IV, 3, 21). So also with reference to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
of departure, i.e. dying 'Mounted by the intelligent Self it moves along
groaning' (IV, 3, 35). Now it is impossible that the unconscious
individual Self, either lying in deep sleep or departing from the body,
should at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> be embraced or mounted by itself, being all-
knowing. Nor can the embracing and mounting Self be some other
individual Self; for no such Self can be all-knowing.--The next Sûtra
supplies a further reason.




44. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as Lord.

That embracing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is further on designated by terms such as
Lord, and so on. 'He is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of all, the ruler of

He does not become greater by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, nor smaller by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> works.

He
is a bank and a boundary so that these worlds may not be confounded.
Brâhmanas seek to know him by the study of the Veda. He who knows him
becomes a Muni. Wishing for that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> only, mendicants leave their
homes' (IV, 4, 22). 'This indeed is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> unborn Self, the strong,
the giver of wealth,--undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless is
Brahman' (IV, 4, 24; 25). Now all the qualities here declared, viz.
being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of all, and so on, cannot possibly belong to the
individual Self even in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release; and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> again arrive
at the conclusion that the ether evolving forms and names is something
different from the released individual soul. The declarations of general
Unity which we meet with in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> rest thereon, that all sentient
and non-sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are effects of Brahman, and hence have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
for their inner Self. That this is the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'All
this is Brahman,' &c., we have explained before. And the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> denying
plurality are to be understood in the same way.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the designation of something different, and so on.'




FOURTH PÂDA.

1. If it be said that some (mention) that which rests on Inference; we
deny this because (the form) refers to what is contained in the simile
of the body; and (this the text) shows.

So far the Sûtras have given instruction about a Brahman, the enquiry
into which serves as a means to obtain what is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of man,
viz. final release; which is the cause of the origination, and so on, of
the world; which differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from all non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as
the Pradhâna, and from all intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
bondage or of release; which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shadow of imperfection;
which is all knowing, all powerful, has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of realising all its
purposes, comprises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself all <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> qualities, is the inner
Self of all, and possesses unbounded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and might. But here a new
special objection presents itself. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to establish the theory
maintained by Kapila, viz. of there being a Pradhâna and individual
souls which do _not_ have their Self in Brahman, it is pointed out by
some that in certain branches of the Veda there are met with certain
passages which appear to adumbrate the doctrine of the Pradhâna being
the universal cause. The Sûtras now apply themselves to the refutation
of this view, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> thereby to confirm the theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being
the only cause of all.

We read in the Katha-Upanishad, 'Beyond the senses there are the objects,
beyond the objects there is the mind, beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> there is the
intellect, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Self is beyond the intellect. Beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>
there is the Unevolved, beyond the Unevolved there is the Person. Beyond
the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> there is nothing--this is the goal, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> road' (Ka. Up.
I, 3, 11). The question here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> by the 'Unevolved' be or be
not meant the Pradhâna, as established by Kapila's theory, of which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not the Self.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former
alternative. For, he says, in the clause 'beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> is the
Unevolved, beyond the Unevolved is the Person,' we recognise the
arrangement of entities as established by the Sânkhya-system, and hence
must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the 'Unevolved' to be the Pradhâna. This is further confirmed
by the additional clause 'beyond the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> there is nothing,' which (in
agreement with Sânkhya principles) denies that there is any being beyond
the soul, which itself is the twenty-fifth and last of the principles
recognised by the Sânkhyas. This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is expressed in the
former part of the Sûtra, 'If it be said that in the sâkhâs of some that
which rests on Inference, i.e. the Pradhâna, is stated as the universal
cause.'

The latter part of the Sûtra refutes this view. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Unevolved'
does not denote a Pradhâna independent of Brahman; it rather denotes the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> represented as a chariot in the simile of the body, i.e. in the
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> instituting a comparison between the Self, body, intellect, and
so on, on the one side, and the charioteer, chariot, &c. on the other
side.--The details are as follows. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> at first--in the section
beginning 'Know the Self to be the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> driving,' &c., and ending 'he
reaches the end of the journey, and that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Vishnu'
(I, 3, 3-9)--compares the devotee desirous of reaching the goal of his
journey through the samsâra, i.e. the abode of Vishnu, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> driving
in a chariot; and his body, senses, and so on, to the chariot and parts
of the chariot; the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> comparison being that he only
reaches the goal who has the chariot, &c. in his control. It thereupon
proceeds to declare which of the different <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> enumerated and
compared to a chariot, and so on, occupy a superior position to the
others in so far, namely, as they are that which requires to be
controlled--'higher than the senses are the objects,' and so on. <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">Higher</span>
than the senses compared to the horses--are the objects--compared to
roads,--because even a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who generally controls his senses finds it
difficult to <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> them when they are in contact with their objects;
<span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the objects is the mind-compared to the reins--because when
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> inclines towards the objects even the non-proximity of the
latter does not make much difference; <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (manas) is
the intellect (buddhi)--compared to the charioteer--because in the
absence of decision (which is the characteristic quality of buddhi) the

(individual) Self, for that Self is the agent whom the intellect serves.
And as all this is subject to the wishes of the Self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
characterises it as the 'great Self.' Superior to that Self again is the
body, compared to the chariot, for all activity whereby the individual
Self strives to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about what is of advantage to itself depends on
the body. And <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> finally than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, the
inner Ruler and Self of all, the term and goal of the journey of the
individual soul; for the activities of all the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> enumerated depend
on the wishes of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. As the universal inner Ruler that
Self brings about the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of the Devotee also; for the Sûtra (II,
3, 41) expressly declares that the activity of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
depends on the Supreme Person. Being the means for bringing about the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and the goal of meditation, that same Self is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be attained; hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says 'Higher than the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> there
is nothing--that is the goal, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> road.' Analogously scripture,
in the antaryâmin-Brâhmana, at first declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> witnesses and rules everything, and thereupon negatives the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of any further ruling principle 'There is no other seer but he,'
&c. Similarly, in the Bhagavad-gîtâ, 'The abode, the agent, the
various senses, the different and manifold functions, and fifth the
Divinity (i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person)' (XVIII, 14); and 'I dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of all; memory and perception, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as their loss, come from
me' (XV, 15). And if, as in the explanation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion,
we <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self being 'controlled,' we must understand
thereby the soul's taking refuge with it; compare the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> Bha. Gî.
XVIII, 61-62, 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> dwells in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of all creatures, whirling
them round as if mounted on a machine; to Him go for refuge.'

Now all the beings, senses, and so on, which had been mentioned in the
simile, are recognised in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'higher than the senses are the
objects,' &c., being designated there by their proper names; but there
is no mention made of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which previously had been compared to the
chariot; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which is denoted by
the term 'the Unevolved.' Hence there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to see here a
reference to the Pradhâna as established in the theory of Kapila. Nor do
we recognise, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion, the general system of Kapila.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares the objects, i.e. sounds and so on, to be superior to
the senses; but in Kapila's system the objects are not viewed as the
causes of the senses. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the statement that the manas
is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the objects does not agree with Kapila's doctrine. Nor is
this the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with regard to the clause 'higher than the buddhi is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> one, the Self; for with Kapila the 'great one' (mahat) is the
buddhi, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not do to say 'higher than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> one is the

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> refers only to those
entities which had previously appeared in the simile. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> itself
further on proves this, when saying 'That Self is hidden in all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
and does not shine forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through their
sharp and subtle intellect. A <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should keep down speech in the

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is difficult to see with the inner and outer organs of

to be held in control. The <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should restrain the sense-organs and

he should restrain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the quiet Self, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman,
which is the inner ruler of all; i.e. he should reach, with his
individual Self so qualified, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Vishnu, i.e. Brahman.--But
how can the term 'the Unevolved' denote the evolved body?--To this
question the next Sûtra furnishes a reply.




2. But the subtle (body), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its capability.

The elements in their fine <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> are what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'Unevolved,' and
this entering into a particular condition becomes the body. It is the
'Unevolved' in the particular condition of the body, which in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
under discussion is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'Unevolved.' 'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its
capability,' i.e. because Unevolved non-sentient matter, when assuming
certain states and forms, is capable of entering on activities promoting
the interest of man. But, an objection is raised, if the 'Unevolved' is
<span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to be <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in its subtle state, what objection is there to our
accepting for the explanation of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> that which is established in
the Sânkhya-system? for there also the 'Unevolved' means nothing else
but <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in its subtle state.




To this the next Sûtra replies--

3. (Matter in its subtle state) subserves an end, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its
dependence on him (viz. the Supreme Person).

<span class="t25 hoverable">Matter</span> in its subtle <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> subserves ends, in so far only as it is
dependent on the Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is the cause of all. We by no means
wish to deny unevolved <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and all its effects in themselves, but in
so far only as they are maintained not to have their Self in the Supreme
Person. For the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that they constitute his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
constitutes their Self; and it is only through this their relation to
him that the Pradhâna, and so on, are capable of accomplishing their
several ends. Otherwise the different essential natures of them all
could never exist,--nor persist, nor act. It is just on the ground of
this dependence on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> not being acknowledged by the Sânkhyas that
their system is disproved by us. In Scripture and Smriti alike, wherever
the origination and destruction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are described, or the
greatness of the Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> is glorified, the Pradhâna and all its
effects, no less than the individual souls, are declared to have their
Self in that Supreme Person. Compare, e.g. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which first says

merged in the Mahat, the Mahat in the Unevolved, the Unevolved in the
Imperishable, the Imperishable in Darkness; Darkness becomes one with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> divinity.' And 'He of whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the body,' &c. up to
'he of whom the Unevolved is the body; of whom the Imperishable is the
body; of whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> is the body; he the inner Self of all beings, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>

closely following on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion, represents the
'Unevolved' as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge!--Not so, we reply. What that
sloka represents as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is (not the Unevolved but)
the intelligent Self, i.e. the Supreme Person. For it is the latter who
forms the general subject-matter, as we infer from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preceding

shine forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and
subtle intellect.' For this reason, also, the clause 'Higher than the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> there is nothing' cannot be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as meant to deny the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
of an entity beyond the 'purusha' in the Sânkhya sense. That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self possesses the qualities of being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sound, &c., we moreover
know from other scriptural texts, such as Mu. Up. I, 1, 6 'That which is
not to be seen, not to be grasped,' &c. And the qualification 'beyond
the Great, unchangeable' is meant to declare that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is
beyond the individual Self which had been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the Great' in a

In the Upanishad under discussion there is mention made of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

his <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> boon he chooses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Nakiketa-fire, which is
a means towards final Release. 'Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-

live in the heaven-world reach Immortality--this I ask as my <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> boon.'
The term 'heaven-world' here denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of man, i.e.

freedom from old age and death; from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that further on (I, 1, 26)

says in reply to the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> demand 'He who thrice performs this Nâkiketa-

to reach it, i.e. of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> assisted by certain works. Yama, having
tested Nakiketas' fitness to receive the desired instruction, thereupon
begins to teach him. 'The Ancient who is difficult to be seen, who has
entered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the
abyss; having known him as God, by means of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on his Self, the
<span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> one leaves joy and sorrow behind.' Here the clause 'having known
the God,' points to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Being that is to be meditated upon; the
clause 'by means of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on his Self points to the attaining agent,
i.e. the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge; and the clause
'having known him the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> ones leave joy and sorrow behind' points to
the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be reached. Nakiketas,
pleased with the general instruction received, questions again in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>

[FOOTNOTE 362:2]. He then continues to glorify the Pranava (I, a,
16-17), and thereupon gives special information in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> about

According to the
first explanation, 'that which is different from dharma' is a means
differing from all ordinary means; 'adharma' 'not-dharma' is what is not
a means, but the result to be reached: hence 'that which is different
from adharma' is a result differing from all ordinary results. 'What is
different from that' is an agent different from 'that'; i.e. an ordinary
agent, and so on. (Sru. Prakâs. p. 1226.)]

refuse to accept are a Prakriti, and so on, of the kind assumed by
Kapila, i.e. not having their Self in Brahman.--We now proceed to
explain the Sûtra.

We read in the Svetâsvatara-Upanishad 'There is one ajâ, red, white, and
black, producing manifold offspring of the same nature. One aja loves
her and lies by her; another leaves her after having enjoyed her.' A
doubt arises here <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this mantra declares a mere Prakriti as
assumed in Kapila's system, or a Prakriti having its Self in Brahman.

The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he points out,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to the non-originatedness of Prakriti, calling her ajâ,
i.e. unborn, and further says that she by herself independently produces
manifold offspring resembling herself. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is rejected by the
Sûtra, on the ground that there is no intimation of a special
circumstance determining the acceptance of the Prakriti as assumed by
the Sânkhyas, i.e. independent of Brahman; for that she is ajâ, i. e.
not born, is not a sufficiently special characteristic. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is
analogous to that of the 'cup.' In the mantra 'There is a cup having its
mouth below and its bottom above' (Bri. Up. II, 2, 3), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> kamasa
conveys to us only the idea of some implement <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in eating, but we are
unable to see what special kind of kamasa is meant; for in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of which is ascertained on the ground of their
derivation (as 'kamasa' from 'kam,' to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> or drink), the special <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> cannot be ascertained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the help of
considerations of general possibility, general subject-matter, and so on.
Now in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the cup we are able to ascertain that the cup meant
is the head, because there is a complementary <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'What is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the cup with its mouth below and its bottom above is the head'; but if
we look out for a similar help to determine the special <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of ajâ,
we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> nothing to convince us that the aja, i. e. the 'unborn'
principle, is the Prakriti of the Sânkhyas. Nor is there anything in the

There moreover is a special <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for understanding by the ajâ
something that depends on Brahman. This the following Sûtra states.

The 'but' has assertory force. 'Light' in the Sûtra means Brahman, in

The Mahânârâyana-Upanishad (of the Taittirîyas) at first refers to

'Smaller than the small, greater than the great, the Self placed in the

sprung from it also this ajâ which is the cause of all 'The one ajâ
(goat), red, white and black, which gives birth to numerous offspring of
the same shape, one aja (he-goat) loves and lies by her; another one
forsakes her after having enjoyed her.' The subject-matter of the entire
section evidently is to give instruction as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of

no less than vital airs, seas, mountains, &c., a creature of Brahman,
and hence has its Self in Brahman. We then apply to the interpretation
of the Svetâsvatara-text the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the analogous Mahânârayana-text,
as determined by the complementary passages, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arrive at the
conclusion that the ajâ in the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> also is a being having its
Self in Brahman. That this is so, moreover, appears from the
Svetâsvatara itself. For in the early part of that Upanishad, we have
after the introductory question, 'Is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the cause?' the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
'The sages devoted to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and concentration have seen the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>

which evidently refers to the ajâ as being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. And as further on also (viz. in the passages 'From
that the Mâyin creates all this, and in this the other is bound up
through Mâya'; 'Know then Prakriti to be Mâyâ and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> the

very same being is referred to, there remains not even a shadow of proof
for the assertion that the mantra under discussion refers to an
independent Prakriti as assumed by the Sânkhyas.

But a further objection is raised, if the Prakriti denoted by ajâ begins
with, i.e. is caused by Brahman, how can it be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ajâ, i.e. the non-
produced one; or, if it is non-produced, how can it be originated by
Brahman? To this the next Sûtra replies.




10. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the teaching of formation (i.e. creation) there is
no contradiction; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the honey.

The 'and' expresses disposal of a doubt that had arisen. There is no
contradiction between the Prakriti being ajâ and originating from light.
On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of instruction being given about the formation (kalpana), i.e.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the world. This interpretation of 'kalpana' is in agreement
with the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the verb klip in the text, 'as formerly the creator made
(akalpayat) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon.'

In our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> the sloka 'from that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of Mâyâ creates all this'
gives instruction about the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the world. From that, i.e. from
<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in its subtle causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> when it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> divided, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
of all creates the entire Universe. From this statement about <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
we understand that Prakriti exists in a twofold <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> according as it is
either cause or effect. During a pralaya it unites itself with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
and abides in its subtle state, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any distinction of names and
forms; it then is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'Unevolved,' and by other similar names. At
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of creation, on the other hand, there reveal themselves in
Prakriti Goodness and the other gunas, it divides itself according to
names and forms, and then is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'Evolved,' and so on, and,
transforming itself into fire, water, and earth, it appears as red,
white, and black. In its causal condition it is ajâ, i.e. unborn, in its
effected condition it is 'caused by light, i.e. Brahman'; hence there is
no contradiction. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of the 'honey.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span>
in his causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is one only, but in his effected <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
makes him into honey in so far namely as he then, for the purpose of
enjoyment on the part of the Vasus and other gods, is the abode of
nectar <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> to be learned from the Rik and
the other Vedas; and further makes him to rise and to set. And between
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> conditions there is no contradiction. This is declared in the
Madhuvidyâ (Ch. Up. III), from 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is indeed the honey of the Devas,'
down to 'when from thence he has risen upwards he neither rises nor
sets; being one he stands in the centre'--'one' here means 'of one
nature.'--The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the Svetâsvatara mantra under
discussion refers to Prakriti as having her Self in Brahman, not to the
Prakriti assumed by the Sânkhyas.

Others, however, are of opinion that the one ajâ of which the mantra
speaks has for its characteristics light, water, and earth. To them we
address the following questions. Do you mean that by what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

excluded by the consideration that it does not remove plurality (which
cannot be reconciled with the _one_ ajâ). The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> alternative is

this basis there is imagined a causal condition of these elements; but
better than this assumption it evidently is to accept the term 'ajâ' as
directly denoting the causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> elements as known from

Nor can we admit the contention that the term 'ajâ' is meant to teach
that Prakriti should metaphorically be viewed as a she-goat; for such a

11. Not from the mention of the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> even, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the diversity

The Vâjasaneyins read in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'He in whom the five "five-people"
and the ether rest, him alone I believe to be the Self; I, who know,
believe him to be Brahman' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 17). The doubt here arises

Kapila's doctrine, or not.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former view,

intimates the twenty-five categories of the Sânkhyas. The compound 'five-
people' (pañkajanâh) denotes groups of five beings, just as the term
pañka-pûlyah denotes aggregates of five bundles of grass. And as we want
to know how many such groups there are, the additional qualification
'five' intimates that there are five such groups; just as if it were
said 'five five-bundles, i. e. five aggregates consisting of five
bundles each.' We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> understand that the 'five five-people' are twenty-
five things, and as the mantra in which the term is met with refers to
final release, we recognise the twenty-five categories known from the
Sânkhya-smriti which are here referred to as objects to be known by
persons desirous of release. For the followers of Kapila teach that
'there is the fundamental causal substance which is not an effect. There
are seven things, viz. the Mahat, and so on, which are causal substances
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as effects. There are sixteen effects.

meant to intimate the categories known from the Sânkhya.--To this the
Sûtra replies that from the mention of the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> twenty-five supposed
to be implied in the expression 'the five five-people,' it does not
follow that the categories of the Sânkhyas are meant. 'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
diversity,' i.e. on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the five-people further qualified by the
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> five being different from the categories of the Sânkhyas. For in

whom' shows the five-people to have their abode, and hence their Self,
in Brahman; and in the continuation of the text, 'him I believe the Self,'

to be Brahman. The five five-people must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be different from the

12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary passage.

We see from a complementary passage, viz. 'They who know the breath of
breath, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of food, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of mind,' that the 'five-people' are the breath, and eye, and so on,
all of which have their abode in Brahman.

But, an objection is raised, while the mantra 'in whom the five five-

complementary <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'they who know the breath of breath,' &c., in the

to say that the 'five-people' in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> are the breath, eye, and so
on.

To this objection the next Sûtra replies.




13. By light, <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> not being (mentioned in the text) of some.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of some, viz. the Kânvas, where <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is not mentioned, the
five-people are recognised to be the five senses, owing to the phrase
'of lights' which is met with in another complementary passage. In the
mantra, 'him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> worship as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of lights,' which precedes
the mantra about the 'five-people,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is spoken of as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
lights, and this suggests the idea of certain lights the activity of
which depends on Brahman. The mantra leaves it undetermined what these
lights are; but from what follows about the 'five-people,' &c., we learn
that what is meant are the senses which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> up as it were their
respective objects. In 'the breath of breath' the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> 'breath' (in
the genitive case) denotes the sense-organ of touch, as that organ is
connected with air, and as the vital breath (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise
suggest itself as the most obvious explanation of prâna) does not
harmonise with the metaphorical term 'light.' 'Of the eye' refers to the
organ of sight; 'of the ear' to the organ of hearing. 'Of food'
comprises the senses of smell and taste together: it denotes the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of smell on the ground that that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> is connected with earth, which
may be 'food,' and the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of taste in so far as 'anna' may be also
explained as that by means of which eating goes on (adyate). 'Of mind'
denotes mind, i. e. the so-called internal organ. Taste and smell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

Vedânta-texts, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> referring to numbers or not, nowhere <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth

cause with regard to Ether, and so on.

Here the philosopher who holds the Pradhâna to be the general cause
comes forward with another objection. The Vedânta-texts, he says, do not
teach that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> proceeds from one and the same agent only, and you
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have no right to hold that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the sole cause of the
world. In one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it is said that our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> proceeded from 'Being',
'Being only this was in the beginning' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 1). In other
places the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is said to have sprung from 'Non-being', 'Non-being
indeed this was in the beginning' (Taitt. Up. II, 7, i); and 'Non-being
only was this in the beginning; it became Being' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1).
As the Vedânta-texts are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not consequent in their statements
regarding the creator, we cannot conclude from them that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the
sole cause of the world. On the other hand, those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do enable us to
conclude that the Pradhâna only is the universal cause. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
'Now all this was then undeveloped' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 7) teaches that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was merged in the undeveloped Pradhâna. and the subsequent clause,
'That developed itself by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and name,' that from that Undeveloped

'Self' and 'Brahman' also may be applied to the Pradhâna in so far as it
is all-pervading (atman from âpnoti), and preeminently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> (brihat).

15. From connexion.

The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> intelligent, consisting of bliss, &c., connects
itself also with the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'Non-being was this in the beginning'
(Taitt. Up. II, 7). For the section of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which precedes that
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (viz. 'Different from this Self consisting of understanding is
the Self consisting of Bliss;--he wished, may I be many;--he <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> all
whatever there is. Having <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> he entered into it; having entered it
he became sat and tyat') clearly refers to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> consisting of Bliss,
which realises its purposes, creates all beings, and entering into them
is the Self of all. When, therefore, after this we meet with the sloka
('Non-being this was in the beginning') introduced by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'On this
there is also this sloka'--which shows that the sloka is meant to throw
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on what precedes; and when further or we have the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'From
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of it the wind blows' &c., which, referring to the same Brahman,
predicates of it universal rulership, bliss of nature, and so on; we
conclude with certainty that the sloka about 'Non-being' also refers to
Brahman. As during a pralaya the distinction of names and forms does not
exist, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also then does not exist in so far as connected with
names and forms, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> applies to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the term 'Non-being.'

16. Because it denotes the world.

The Sânkhya comes forward with a further objection. Although the
Vedânta-texts teach an intelligent principle to be the cause of the
world, they do not present to us as objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> anything that
could be the cause of the world, apart from the Pradhâna and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as
established by the Sânkhya-system. For the Kaushîtakins declare in their
text, in the dialogue of Bâlâki and Ajâtasatru, that none but the
enjoying (individual) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is to be known as the cause of the world,
'Shall I tell you Brahman? He who is the maker of those persons and of
whom this is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (or "to whom this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> belongs") he indeed is to
be known' (Kau. Up. IV, 19). Bâlâki at the outset proposes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of instruction, and when he is found himself not to know
Brahman, Ajâtasatru instructs him about it, 'he indeed is to be known.'
But from the relative clause 'to whom this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> belongs,' which connects
the being to be known with work, we infer that by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> we have here
to understand the enjoying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is the ruler of Prakriti, not any
other being. For no other being is connected with work; work, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
meritorious or the contrary, belongs to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only. Nor
must you contest this conclusion on the ground that 'work' is here to be

the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> ascribe to the general cause, viz. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and so on, are
attributes of intelligent <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> only, we arrive at the conclusion that
what constitutes the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is the non-intelligent Pradhâna
guided by the intelligent soul.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes of, by saying 'because (the
work) denotes the world.' It is not the insignificant individual soul--
which is under the influence of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> works, and by
erroneously imputing to itself the attributes of Prakriti becomes the
cause of the effects of the latter--that is the topic of our text; but
rather the Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shadow of imperfection
such as Nescience and the like, who is a treasure of all possible

sole cause of this entire world. This is proved by the circumstance that
the term 'work' connected with 'this' (in 'of whom this (is) the work')
denotes the Universe which is an effect of the Supreme Person. For the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'this' must, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its sense, the general topic of the
section and so on, be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in a non-limited meaning, and hence denotes
the entire world, as presented by Perception and the other means of
knowledge, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings. That the term
'work' does not here denote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions, appears from the
following consideration of the context. Bâlâki at first offers to teach
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> ('Shall I tell you Brahman?') and thereupon holds forth on
various persons abiding in the sun, and so on, as being Brahman.
Ajatasatru however refuses to accept this instruction as not setting
forth Brahman, and finally, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to enlighten Bâlâki, addresses him
'He, O Bâlâki, who is the maker of those persons,' &c. Now as the
different personal souls abiding in the sun, &c., and connected with
karman in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions, are known already by Bâlâki,
the term 'karman'--met with in the next clause--is clearly meant to

must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to mean not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds or action in general, but
rather the entire Universe in so far as being the outcome of activity.

17. Should it be said that this is not so on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the inferential
marks of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the chief vital air; we reply that this
has been explained before.

With reference to the plea urged by the Pûrvapakshin that, owing to
inferential marks pointing to the individual soul, and the circumstance
of mention being made of the chief vital air, we must decide that the
section treats of the enjoying individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self, the Sûtra remarks that this argumentation has already been
disposed of, viz. in connexion with the Pratardana vidyâ. For there it
was shown that when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is ascertained, on the ground of a
comprehensive survey of initial and concluding clauses, to refer to
Brahman, all inferential marks which point to other topics must be
interpreted so as to fall in with the principal topic. Now in our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

further mentioned in the middle of the section, for the clause 'of whom
this is the work' does not refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in general but to the

we hear of a reward which connects itself only with meditations on
Brahman, viz. supreme sovereignty preceded by the conquest of all evil.
'Having overcome all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> he obtains pre-eminence among all beings,

Brahman. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> it was shown above that the references to the

Pratardana vidyâ really explain themselves in connexion with a threefold
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman. As in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'Then with this prâna alone he
becomes one' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'this' and 'prâna' may be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as co-

'prâna' is ascertained to mean <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also, we must understand the
mention of prâna to be made with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so
far as having the prâna for its body. But how can the references to the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> be put in connexion with Brahman?--This point is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
up by the next Sûtra.




18. But Jaimini thinks that it has another purport, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
question and answer; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> some also.

The 'but' is meant to preclude the idea that the mention made of the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> enables us to understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section as concerned
with that soul.--The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the mention made
of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has another meaning, i.e. aims at conveying the
idea of what is different from the individual soul, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. 'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of question and answer.' According to
the story told in the Upanishad, Ajâtasatru leads Bâlâki to where a
sleeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is resting, and convinces him that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is different
from breath, by addressing the sleeping person, in whom breath only is
awake, with names belonging to prâna [FOOTNOTE 383:1] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the sleeper
being awaked thereby, and after that rousing him by a push of his staff.
Then, with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to teaching Bâlâki the difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> from the
individual soul, he asks him the following questions: 'Where, O Bâlâki,
did this <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> here sleep? Where was he? Whence did he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> come back?'
To these questions he thereupon himself replies, 'When sleeping he sees
no dream, then he becomes one in that prâna alone.--From that Self the
organs proceed each towards its place, from the organs the gods, from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> the worlds.' Now this reply, no less than the questions,
clearly refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as something different from the
individual Self. For that entering into which the soul, in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
deep sleep, attains its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and enjoys complete serenity, being
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the disturbing experiences of pleasure and pain that accompany
the states of waking and of dream; and that from which it again returns
to the fruition of pleasure and pain; that is nothing else but the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. For, as other scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> testify ('Then he becomes
united with the True,' Ch. Up. VI, 8, 1; 'Embraced by the intelligent
Self he knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within,' Bri, Up.
IV, 3, 21), the abode of deep sleep is the intelligent Self which is
different from the individual Self, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
conclude that the reference, in question and answer, to the individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> subserves the end of instruction being given about what is
different from that soul, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. We hence also reject
the Pûrvapakshin's contention that question and answer refer to the
individual soul, that the veins <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> hita are the abode of deep sleep,
and that the well-known clause as to the prâna must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to mean
that the aggregate of the organs becomes one in the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

dream, and, as we have shown above, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only is the abode of deep
sleep; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that the individual soul, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with all
its ministering organs, becomes one with, and again proceeds from,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only--which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> designates as Prâna.--Moreover some, viz.
the Vâjasaneyins in this same colloquy of Bâlâki and Ajâtasatru as
recorded in their text, clearly distinguish from the vijñâna-maya, i.e.
the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self which
then is the abode of the individual soul. 'Where was then the person,
consisting of intelligence, and from whence did he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> come back?--When
he was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> asleep, then the intelligent person, having through the
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the senses absorbed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself all intelligence,
lies in the ether that is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart.' Now the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'ether' is
known to denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; cf. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that the
small ether'(Ch. Up. VIII, 1, 1). This shows us that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
is mentioned in the Vâjasaneyin <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> to the end of setting forth what
is different from it, viz. the prâjña Self, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.
The general conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the Kaushîtaki-text under
discussion proposes as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> something that is

the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world, and that hence the Vedânta-texts nowhere
intimate that general causality belongs either to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or
to the Pradhâna under the soul's guidance. Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'denotation of the world.'

_Great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, king._ The Sru. Pra. comments
as follows: _Great one_; because according to Sruti Prâna is the oldest

In spite of the conclusion arrived at there may remain a suspicion that
here and there in the Upanishads <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are to be met with which aim at
setting forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as maintained in Kapila's system, and that hence
there is no room for a being different from the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lord. This suspicion the Sûtra undertakes to remove, in connexion
with the Maitreyi-brâhmana, in the Brihadaranyaka. There we read 'Verily,
a husband is dear, not for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the husband, but for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of
the Self a husband is dear, and so on. Everything is dear, not for the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of everything, but for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the Self everything is dear. The
Self should be seen, should be heard, should be reflected on, should be
meditated upon. When the Self has been seen, heard, reflected upon,
meditated upon, then all this is known' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 6).--Here the
doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Self enjoined in this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
seeing, &c., be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as held by the Sânkhyas, or the Supreme Lord,
all-knowing, capable of realising all his purposes, and so on. The
Pûrvapakshin upholds the former alternative. For, he says, the beginning
no less than the middle and the concluding part of the section conveys
the idea of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only. In the beginning the individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only is meant, as appears from the connexion of the Self with
husband, wife, children, wealth, cattle, and so on. This is confirmed by
the middle part of the section where the Self is said to be connected
with origination and destruction, 'a mass of knowledge, he having risen
from these elements vanishes again into them. When he has departed there
is no more consciousness.' And in the end we have 'whereby should he
know the knower'; where we again recognise the knowing subject, i.e. the
individual soul, not the Lord. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> conclude that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is
meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as held by the Sânkhyas.--But in the
beginning there is a clause, viz. 'There is no hope of immortality by

Yâjñavalkya that there is no hope of immortality through wealth,
Maitreyî expresses her slight regard for wealth and all such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as

That Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is the topic of
the Brâhmana.

We further demur to our antagonist's maintaining that the entire
Brâhmana treats of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> because that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is at the
outset represented as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of enquiry, this being inferred from
its connexion with husband, wife, wealth, &c. For if the clause 'for the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> (literally, _for the _desire) of the Self refers to the individual
Self, we cannot help connecting (as, in fact, we must do in any case)
that Self with the Self referred to in the subsequent clause, 'the Self
indeed is to be seen,' &c.; the connexion having to be conceived in that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the information given in the former clause somehow subserves
the cognition of the Self enjoined in the latter clause. 'For the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
of the Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then mean 'for the attainment of the objects desired
by the Self.' But if it is first said that husband, wife, &c., are dear
because they fulfil the wishes of the individual Self, it could hardly
be said further on that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that Self must be enquired into;
for what, in the circumstances of the case, naturally is to be enquired
into and searched for are the dear objects but not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
him to whom those objects are dear, apart from the objects themselves.
It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> certainly be somewhat senseless to declare that since husband,
wife, &c., are dear because they fulfil the desires of the individual
soul, therefore, setting aside those dear objects, we must enquire into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> apart from all the objects of its desire.
On the contrary, it having been declared that husband, wife, &c., are
dear not on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of husband, wife, &c., but on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Self,
they should not be dropped, but included in the further investigation,
just because they subserve the Self. And should our opponent (in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to avoid the difficulty of establishing a satisfactory connexion between
the different clauses) maintain that the clause, 'but everything is dear
for the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the Self,' is not connected with the following clause,
'the Self is to be seen,' &c., we point out that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> break the

should then be unable to point out what is the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the earlier part
of the Brahmâna. We must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> attempt to explain the connexion in

wife, children, wealth, &c.--should be abandoned and the Self only
should be searched for. This explanation is as follows. After having
stated that wealth, and so on, are no means to obtain immortality which
consists in permanent absolute bliss, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that the

'not for the wish of the husband a husband is dear,' &c., <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> must
be understood as follows--a husband, a wife, a son, &c., are not dear to
us in consequence of a wish or purpose on their part, 'may I, for my own
end or advantage be dear to him,' but they are dear to us for the wish
of the Self, i.e. to the end that there may be accomplished the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self--which <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> aims at the devotee obtaining what is

corresponds to those works, that 'dearness' being bound in each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> to
a definite place, time, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and degree. This is in accordance with
the scriptural text, 'For he alone bestows bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7).
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> are not dear, or the contrary, to us by themselves, but only in
so far as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self makes them such. Compare the text, 'The same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which erst gave us delight later on becomes the source of grief;
and what was the cause of wrath afterwards tends to peace. Hence there
is nothing that in itself is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> either of pleasure or of pain.'

Self in the clause 'for the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of the Self' were accepted as
denoting the individual Self, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the clause 'the Self must be seen'

with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of bringing about what is desired by them (viz. husband,
wife, &c.), but rather to the end of bringing about what is desired by
himself; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that being which is, to the individual soul,

'Self' in both clauses, 'For the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of the Self' and 'The Self is to

The theories stated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preceding Sûtras <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having been found
untenable, the teacher Kâsakritsna states his own view, to the effect
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting the jîva are applied to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

Brahman's body. This theory rests on a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of well-known texts,
'Entering into them with this living (individual) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> let me evolve

(Bri. Up. III, 7, 22); 'He who moves

'Entered within, the ruler of beings, the Self of all.' That the term
'jîva' denotes not only the jîva itself, but extends in its denotation
up to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, we have explained before when discussing the
text, 'Let me evolve names and forms.' On this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the identity of
the individual and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self consisting in their being related to
each other as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul, we can accept in their <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> and unmutilated

perfection and omniscience of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, or teach how the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> steeped in ignorance and misery is to be saved through
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman, or describe the origination and reabsorption of
the world, or aim at showing how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is identical with Brahman.
For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the author of the Sûtras, rejecting other views, accepts
the theory of Kâsakritsna. Returning to the Maitreyî-brâhmana we proceed
to explain the general sense, from the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> previously discussed
onwards. Being questioned by Maitreyî as to the means of immortality,
Yâjñavalkya teaches her that this means is given in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self ('The Self is to be seen,' &c.). He next indicates in a
general <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> ('When the Self is
seen,' &c.), and--availing himself of the similes of the drum, &c.--of
the government over the organs, mind, and so on, which are instrumental
towards meditation. He then explains in detail that the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
meditation, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, is the sole cause of the entire
world; and the ruler of the aggregate of organs on which there depends
all activity with regard to the objects of the senses ('As clouds of
smoke proceed,' &c.; 'As the ocean is the home of all the waters'). He,
next, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to stimulate the effort which leads to immortality, shows
how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self abiding in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the individual Self, is of
one uniform character, viz. that of limitless <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> ('As a lump
of salt,' &c.), and how that same Self characterised by homogeneous
limitless <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> connects itself in the Samsâra <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> with the
products of the elements ('a mass of knowledge, it rises from those
elements and again vanishes into them'). He then adds, 'When he has
departed, there is no more knowledge'; <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> that in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
Release, where the soul's unlimited essential <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is not
contracted in any way, there is none of those specific cognitions by
which the Self identifying itself with the body, the sense-organs, &c.,
views itself as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or a god, and so on. Next--in the passage, 'For
where there is duality as it were'--he, holding that the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of a
plurality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> not having their Self in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is due to ignorance,
shows that for him who has freed himself from the shackles of ignorance
and recognises this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as animated by Brahman, the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
plurality is dispelled by the recognition of the absence of any
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> apart from Brahman. He then proceeds, 'He by whom he knows all
this, by what means should he know Him?' This means--He, i.e. the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, which abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Self

through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; by what means should the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> know Him? In
other words, there is no such means of knowledge: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
cannot be fully understood by the individual soul. 'That Self,' he
continues, 'is to be expressed as--not so, not so!' That means--He, the

the theistic Sânkhya comes forward as an opponent. It must indeed be

(Svet. Up. IV, 9, 10). And similarly Smriti, 'with me as supervisor
Prakriti brings forth the Universe of the movable and the immovable'
(Bha. GÎ. IX, 10). Although, therefore, the Pradhâna is not expressly
stated by Scripture to be the material cause, we must assume that there
is such a Pradhâna and that, superintended by the Lord, it constitutes
the material cause, because otherwise the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be

For ordinary
experience shows us on all sides that the operative cause and the
material cause are quite distinct: we invariably have on the one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span>
clay, gold, and other material substances which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the material causes
of pots, ornaments, and so on, and on the other hand, distinct from them,
potters, goldsmiths, and so on, who act as operative causes. And we
further observe that the production of effects invariably requires
several instrumental agencies. The Vedânta-texts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> cannot
possess the strength to convince us, in open defiance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

is only the operative but not the material cause, while the material
cause is the Pradhâna guided by Brahman.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra combats. Prakriti, i.e. the material
cause, not only the operative cause, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only; this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> being in

material cause of the world. That Scripture teaches the operative and
the material causes to be separate, is not true; it rather teaches the
unity of the two. For in the text, 'Have you asked for that âdesa (above,
and generally, understood to mean "instruction"), by which that which is
not <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> becomes heard?' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'âdesa' has to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to mean _ruler_,
in agreement with the text, 'by the command--or rule--of that
Imperishable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon stand apart' (Bri. Up. III, 8, 9), so that the
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> means, 'Have you asked for that Ruler by whom, when <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> and
known, even that which is not <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> and known, becomes <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> and known?'
This clearly shows the unity of the operative (ruling or supervising)
cause and the material cause; <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in conjunction with the subsequent
declaration of the unity of the cause previous to creation, 'Being only,
this was in the beginning, one only,' and the denial of a further
operative cause implied in the further qualification 'advitîyam,' i.e.
'without a second.'--But how then have we to understand <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as
the one quoted above (from the Kûlika-Upanishad) which declare Prakriti
to be <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> and the material cause of the world?--Prakriti, we reply,

who views anything as apart from the Self; and 'But where for him the
Self has become all, whereby should he see whom?' (Bri. Up. II, 4, 6;

The
mantra, 'There was darkness, hidden in darkness,' &c. (Ri. Samh. X, 129,
3), sets forth the same view; and so does Manu (I, 5), 'This universe
existed in the shape of Darkness, unperceived, destitute of distinctive
marks, unattainable by reasoning, unknowable, wholly immersed as it were
in deep sleep.' And, as to the text, 'from that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of Mâya creates

As to the contention raised by the Pûrvapakshin that on the basis of
invariable experience it must be held that one and the same principle
cannot be both material and operative cause, and that effects cannot be

'sprinkle with fire' will convince us that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> may perform the office

experience holds good, on the other hand, with regard to clay and
similar materials which are destitute of <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> and hence
incapable of guiding and supervising; and with regard to potters and
similar agents who do not possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of transforming themselves

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> must be held to be both causes for that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
such as 'He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth,' and 'It thought,
may I be many, may I grow forth,' declare that the creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

teaches that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> on Brahman's part is preceded by the purpose 'May
I, and no other than I, become manifold in the shape of various non-

25. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of both being directly declared.

The conclusion arrived at above is based not only on scriptural
declaration, illustrative instances and statements of reflection; but in
addition Scripture directly states that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> alone is the material as

ones, I tell you, it stood on Brahman, supporting the worlds.'--Here a
question is asked, suggested by the ordinary worldly view, as to what
was the material and instruments <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> when creating; and the
answer--based on the insight that there is nothing unreasonable in
ascribing all possible powers to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which differs from all other

whereby the ordinary <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is disposed of.--The next Sûtra supplies a
further reason.




26. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (the Self) making itself.

A new doubt here presents itself.--'The True, knowledge, infinite is
Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Bliss is Brahman' (Bri. Up. III, 9, 28);

27. Owing to modification.

This means--owing to the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of modification (parinâma).
The modification taught in our system is not such as to introduce
imperfections into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, on the contrary it confers on it

FIRST PÂDA.

the fault of want of room for other Smritis.

The first adhyâya has established the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that what the Vedânta-texts

non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> known through the ordinary means of proof, viz.
Perception and so on, as from the intelligent souls <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> connected

which constitutes the inner Self of all things. The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> adhyâya is
now begun for the purpose of proving that the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth cannot

Sûtrakâra at first turns against those who maintain that the Vedanta-
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not establish the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> indicated above, on the ground of that
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> being contradicted by the Smriti of Kapila, i. e. the Sânkhya-
system.

But how can it be maintained at all that Scripture does not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth a
certain <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> because thereby it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> enter into conflict with Smriti?
For that Smriti if contradicted by Scripture is to be held of no account,
is already settled in the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ ('But where there is
contradiction Smriti is not to be regarded,' I, 3, 3).--Where, we reply,
a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> can be definitely settled on the basis of Scripture--as e.g. in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the Vedic injunction, 'he is to sing, after having touched
the Udumbara branch' (which clearly contradicts the Smriti injunction
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> branch is to be covered up)--Smriti indeed need not be
regarded. But the topic with which the Vedânta-texts are concerned is
hard to understand, and hence, when a conflict arises between those
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> and a Smriti propounded by some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Rishi, the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> does not

Svet. Up. V, 2), and who moreover (unlike Brihaspati and other Smriti--

function of supporting the teaching of the karmakânda of the Veda. The
Sânkhya Smriti, on the other hand, is entirely devoted to the setting
forth of theoretical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> (not of practical duty), and if it is not
accepted in that quality, it is of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> whatsoever.--On this ground
the Sûtra sets forth the primâ facie view, 'If it be said that there
results the fault of there being no room for certain Smritis.'

The same Sûtra replies 'no; because there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result the fault of want
of room for other Smritis.' For other Smritis, that of Manu e.g., teach
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the universal cause. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> Manu says, 'This (world)

is eternal, permanent.' (Dharmasû. I, 8, 22, 4; 23, 2).--If the question
as to the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Vedânta-texts were to be settled by means of
Kapila's Smriti, we should have to accept the extremely undesirable
conclusion that all the Smritis quoted are of no authority. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
that the Vedânta-texts are concerned with theoretical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> lying
outside the sphere of Perception and the other means of knowledge, and
that hence students possessing only a limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Veda
require some help in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> fully to make out the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Vedânta.
But what must be avoided in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is to give any opening for the
conclusion that the very numerous Smritis which closely follow the
doctrine of the Vedânta, are composed by the most competent and
trustworthy persons and aim at supporting that doctrine, are irrelevant;
and it is for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that Kapila's Smriti which contains a doctrine
opposed to Scripture must be disregarded. The support required is
elucidation of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> conveyed by Scripture, and this clearly cannot
be effected by means of a Smriti contradicting Scripture. Nor is it of
any avail to plead, as the Pûrvapakshin does, that Manu and other
Smritis of the same kind fulfil in any <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the function of elucidating
the acts of religious duty enjoined in the karmakânda. For if they
enjoin acts of religious duty as means to win the favour of the Supreme
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> but do not impress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us the idea of that Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span>
himself who is to be pleased by those acts, they are also not capable of
impressing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us the idea of those acts themselves. That it is the
character of all religious acts to win the favour of the Supreme Spirit,
Smriti distinctly declares, 'Man attains to perfection by worshipping
with his proper action Him from whom all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Beings</span> proceed; and by whom all
this is stretched out' (Bha. Gî. XVIII, 46); 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on

will then reach the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and not return hither' (Daksha-
smriti); and 'Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> with whom, intent on their duties, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span>

their souls' (Vi. Pu.). Nor can it be said that Manu and similar Smritis
have a function in so far as setting forth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> (not aiming at final
Release but) bringing about certain results included in transmigratory
existence, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> here on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in a heavenly world; for the
essential character of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> also is to please the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person.
As is said in the Bhagavad-gîtâ (IX, 23, 24); 'Even they who devoted to

am the enjoyer and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all sacrifices; but they know me not in

all the offerings made to either.' Nor finally can we admit the
contention that it is rational to interpret the Vedánta-texts in
accordance with Kapila's Smriti because Kapila, in the Svetâsvatara text,
is referred to as a competent person. For from this it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that,
as Brihaspati is, in Sruti and Smriti, mentioned as a pattern of
consummate wisdom, Scripture should be interpreted in agreement with the
openly materialistic and atheistic Smriti composed by that authority.
But, it may here be said, the Vedânta-texts should after all be
interpreted in agreement with Kapila's Smriti, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that
Kapila had through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his concentrated <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (yoga)
arrived at an insight into truth.--To this objection the next Sûtra
replies.

The 'and' in the Sûtra has the force of 'but,' being meant to dispel the
doubt raised. There are many other authors of Smritis, such as Manu, who

Scripture, is founded on error, and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to modify
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the Vedânta-texts.--Here finishes the adhikarana treating
of 'Smriti.'




3. Hereby the Yoga is refuted.

By the above refutation of Kapila's Smriti the Yoga-smriti also is
refuted.--But a question arises, What further doubt arises here with
regard to the Yoga system, so as to render needful the formal extension
to the Yoga of the arguments previously <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth against the Sânkhya?--
It might appear, we reply, that the Vedânta should be supported by the
Yoga-smriti, firstly, because the latter admits the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a Lord;
secondly, because the Vedânta-texts mention Yoga as a means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
about final Release; and thirdly, because Hiranyagarbha, who proclaimed
the Yoga-smriti is qualified for the promulgation of all Vedânta-texts.--
But these arguments refute themselves as follows. In the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the
Yoga holds the Pradhâna, which is independent of Brahman, to be the
general material cause, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> acknowledged by it is a mere
operative cause. In the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of meditation, in which
Yoga consists, is determined by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation,
and as of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> objects, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the Lord, the former does
not have its Self in Brahman, and the latter is neither the cause of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> nor endowed with the other auspicious qualities (which belong to
Brahman), the Yoga is not of Vedic character. And as to the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> point,
Hiranyagarbha himself is only an individual soul, and hence liable to be
overpowered by the inferior gunas, i.e. passion and darkness; and hence
the Yoga-smriti is founded on error, no less than the Purânas,
promulgated by him, which are founded on rajas and tamas. The Yoga
cannot, therefore, be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for the support of the Vedânta.--Here
finishes the adhikarana of 'the refutation of the Yoga.'




4. Not, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the difference of character of that; and its being
such (appears) from Scripture.

The same opponent who laid stress on the conflict between Scripture and
Smriti now again comes forward, relying this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (not on Smriti but) on
simple reasoning. Your doctrine, he says, as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> being an
effect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which you attempted to prove by a refutation of the
Sânkhya Smriti shows itself to be irrational for the following reason.
Perception and the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> show this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with all its
sentient and non-sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> to be of a non-intelligent and impure
nature, to possess none of the qualities of the Lord, and to have pain
for its very essence; and such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> totally differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from
the Brahman, postulated by you, which is said to be all-knowing, of
supreme lordly power, antagonistic to all evil, enjoying unbroken
uniform blessedness. This difference in character of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> from

is seen to be directly stated in Scripture itself; compare 'Knowledge
and non-knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 6, 1); 'Thus are these objects placed
on the subjects, and the subjects on the prâna' (Kau. Up. III, 9); 'On
the same tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> sits grieving, immersed, bewildered by his own
impotence' (Svet. Up. IV, 7); 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> not being a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is bound
because he has to enjoy' (Svet. Up. I, 8); and so on; all which <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
refer to the effect, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as being non-intelligent, of the
essence of pain, and so on. The general rule is that an effect is non-
different in character from its cause; as e.g. pots and bracelets are
non-different in character from their material causes--clay and gold.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot, therefore, be the effect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> from which it
differs in character, and we hence conclude that, in agreement with the
Sânkhya Smriti, the Pradhâna which resembles the actual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in
character must be assumed to be the general cause. Scripture, although
not dependent on anything else and concerned with super-sensuous objects,
must all the same come to terms with ratiocination (tarka); for all the
different means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can in many cases help us to arrive at a
decisive conclusion, only if they are supported by ratiocination. For by
tarka we understand that kind of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (intellectual activity) which
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of any given matter, by means of an investigation either
into the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> or into collateral (auxiliary)
factors, determines what possesses proving power, and what are the
special details of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> under consideration: this kind of
cognitional activity is also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ûha. All means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> equally
stand in need of tarka; Scripture however, the authoritative character
of which specially depends on expectancy (âkânkshâ), proximity
(sannidhi), and compatibility (yogyatâ), throughout requires to be
assisted by tarka. In accordance with this Manu says,'He who
investigates by means of reasoning, he only knows religious duty, and
none other.' It is with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to such confirmation of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
Scripture by means of Reasoning that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare that certain
topics such as the Self must be 'reflected on' (mantavya).--Now here it
might possibly be said that as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is ascertained from Scripture to
be the sole cause of the world, it must be admitted that <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
exists in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> also, which is an effect of Brahman. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
as the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of an intelligent being is not perceived when it is
in the states of deep sleep, swoon, &c., so the intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
jars and the like also is not observed, although it really exists; and
it is this very difference of manifestation and non-manifestation of
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> on which the distinction of intelligent and non-intelligent
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> depends.--But to this we reply that permanent non-perception of
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> proves its non-existence. This consideration also refutes
the hypothesis of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> non-intelligent possessing the
power, or potentiality, of consciousness. For if you maintain that a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> possesses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of producing an effect while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> that effect
is never and nowhere _seen_ to be produced by it, you may as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
proclaim at a meeting of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of barren women that their mothers possess
eminent procreative power! Moreover, to prove at first from the Vedânta-
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the material cause of the world, and from this
that pots and the like possess potential consciousness, and therefrom
the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of non-manifested consciousness; and then, on the other
hand, to start from the last principle as proved and to deduce therefrom
that the Vedânta-texts prove <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be the material cause of the
world, is simply to argue in a circle; for that the relation of cause
and effect should exist between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> different in character is just
what cannot be proved.--What sameness of character, again, of causal
substance and effects, have you in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> when you maintain that from the
absence of such sameness it follows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be proved to be
the material cause of the world? It cannot be complete sameness of all
attributes, because in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the relation of cause and effect (which
after all requires _some_ difference) could not be established. For we
do not observe that in pots and jars which are fashioned out of a lump
of clay there persists the quality of 'being a lump' which belongs to
the causal substance. And should you say that it suffices that there
should be equality in some or any attribute, we point out that such is
actually the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the world, both of which
have the attribute of 'existence' and others. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
rather is as follows. There is equality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between an effect and
a cause, in that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> that those essential characteristics by which the
causal substance distinguishes itself from other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> persist in its
effects also: those characteristic features, e.g., which distinguish
gold from clay and other materials, persist also in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> made of gold-
bracelets and the like. But applying this consideration to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that Brahman's essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is to be antagonistic
to all evil, and to consist of knowledge, bliss and power, while the
world's essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is to be the opposite of all this. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
cannot, therefore, be the material cause of the world.

But, it may be objected, we observe that even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of different
essential characteristics stand to each other in the relation of cause
and effect. From man, e.g., who is a sentient being, there spring nails,
teeth, and hair, which are non-sentient things; the sentient scorpion
springs from non-sentient dung; and non-sentient threads proceed from
the sentient spider.--This objection, we reply, is not valid; for in the
instances quoted the relation of cause and effect rests on the non-
sentient elements only (i.e. it is only the non-sentient <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which produces nails, &c.).

But, a further objection is raised, Scripture itself declares in many
places that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> generally held to be non-sentient really possess
intelligence; compare 'to him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> said'; 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> desired'; 'the
prânas quarrelling among themselves as to their relative pre-eminence

<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> to rivers, hills, the sea, and so on. Hence there is after
all no essential difference in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between sentient and so-called non-
sentient beings.--To this objection the Pûrvapakshin replies in the next
Sûtra.

as their superintendents.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> adhere to our conclusion that the world, being non-
intelligent and hence essentially different in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from Brahman,
cannot be the effect of Brahman; and that therefore, in agreement with
Smriti confirmed by reasoning, the Vedânta-texts must be held to teach
that the Pradhâna is the universal material cause. This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
is met by the following Sûtra.




6. But it is seen.

The 'but' indicates the change of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> (introduced in the present Sûtra).
The assertion that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be the material cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
because the latter differs from it in essential nature, is unfounded;
since it is a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of observation that even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect. For it is
observed that from honey and similar substances there originate worms
and other little animals.--But it has been said above that in those
cases there is sameness of nature, in so far as the relation of cause
and effect holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> only between the non-intelligent elements in both!--
This assertion was indeed made, but it does not suffice to prove that
equality of character between cause and effect which you have in view.
For, being apprehensive that from the demand of equality of character in
some point or other only it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that, as all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have
certain characteristics in common, anything might originate from
anything, you have declared that the equality of character necessary for
the relation of cause and effect is constituted by the persistence, in
the effect, of those characteristic points which differentiate the cause
from other things. But it is evident that this restrictive rule does not
hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the origination of worms and the like from
honey and so on; and hence it is not unreasonable to assume that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> also, although differing in character from Brahman, may originate
from the latter. For in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of worms originating from honey,
scorpions from dung, &c., we do _not_ observe--what indeed we _do_
observe in certain other cases, as of pots made of clay, ornaments made
of gold--that the special characteristics distinguishing the causal
substance from other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> persist in the effects also.




7. If it be said that (the effect is) non-existing; we say no, there
being a mere denial.

But, an objection is raised, if Brahman, the cause, differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
from the effect, viz. the world, this means that cause and effect are
separate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and that hence the effect does not exist in the cause, i.
e. Brahman; and this again implies that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> originates from what
has no existence!--Not so, we reply. For what the preceding Sûtra has
laid down is merely the denial of an absolute rule demanding that cause
and effect should be of the same nature; it was not asserted that the
effect is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> altogether different and separate from the cause. We
by no means abandon our tenet that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the cause modifies itself so
as to assume the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> differing from it in character. For
such is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> with the honey and the worms also. There is difference
of characteristics, but--as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of gold and golden bracelets--
there is oneness of substance.--An objection is raised.




8. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of such consequences in reabsorption (the Vedânta-texts

The term 'reabsorption' here stands as an instance of all the states of
Brahman, reabsorption, creation, and so on--among which it is the first
as appears from the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> giving instruction about those several states
'Being only was this in the beginning'; 'The Self only was this in the
beginning.' If we accept the doctrine of the oneness of substance of
cause and effect, then, absorption, creation, &c. of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> all being
in Brahman, the different states of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> connect themselves
with Brahman, and the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be affected by all the
imperfections of its effect; in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as all the attributes of
the bracelet are present in the gold also. And the undesirable
consequence of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that contradictory attributes as predicated

same substance; cp. 'He who is all-knowing' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'Free

accept the explanation that, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its causal as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as its

of course incapable of all this, and hence even less fit to constitute a

sense; for there are abodes of fruition, such as palaces and the like,
which are not considered to be bodies. Nor will it avail, narrowing the
last definition, to say that that only is an abode of enjoyment directly
abiding in which a being enjoys pain and pleasure; for if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> enters

maintained that he must be joined to a body, consisting of all sentient

according to which a 'body' means no more than a _means_ of enjoyment is
refuted hereby.

You will now possibly try another definition, viz. that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a

activity of all depend on him.--But this also is objectionable; since in

and since the persistence of a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does not depend on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a body, 'Without <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and feet he grasps and

The teaching of the Vedânta-texts is not inappropriate, since there are

The assertion made by the Pûrvapakshin as to the impossibility of the

declare to be the vain outcome of altogether vicious reasoning springing
from the idle fancies of persons who have never fully considered the

declare that the entire world, subtle or gross, material or spiritual,

Again, to say that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is that, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of which depends

control and so on are not actually perceived because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of

(thus strictly speaking is not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at all but) is spoken of as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
because it is a part of the aggregate of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> which previously
constituted a body. In this sense, then, all sentient and non-sentient
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Supreme Person, for they are
completely controlled and supported by him for his own ends, and are
absolutely subordinate to him. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> which <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as
'bodiless among bodies' (e.g. Ka. Up. I. 2, 22), only mean to deny of

that the Universe is his body. This point will be fully established in
subsequent adhikaranas also. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preceding Sûtras (8 and 9) merely
suggest the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> proved in the adhikarana beginning with II, 1, 21.




10. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the objections to his view.

The theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the universal cause has to be accepted not
only because it is itself <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from objections, but also because the
pradhâna theory is open to objections, and hence must be abandoned. For
on this latter theory the origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot be accounted
for. The Sânkhyas hold that owing to the soul's approximation to
Prakriti the attributes of the latter are fictitiously superimposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which in itself consists entirely of pure <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
from all change, and that thereon depends the origination of the
empirical world. Now here we must raise the question as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
that approximation or nearness of Prakriti which causes the
superimposition on the changeless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the attributes of Prakriti.
Does that nearness mean merely the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of Prakriti or some change
in Prakriti? or does it mean some change in the soul?--Not the latter;
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is assumed to be incapable of change.--Nor again a change
in Prakriti; for changes in Prakriti are supposed, in the system, to be
the effects of superimposition, and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be its cause. And
if, finally, the nearness of Prakriti means no more than its existence,
it follows that even the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be liable to that
superimposition (for Prakriti exists always).--The Sânkhya is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
unable to give a rational <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the origination of the world. This
same point will be treated of fully in connexion with the special
refutation of the Sânkhya theory. (II, 2, 6.)




11. Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of reasoning.

The theory, resting on Scripture, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the universal cause
must be accepted, and the theory of the Pradhâna must be abandoned,
because all (mere) reasoning is ill-founded. This latter point is proved
by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the arguments <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth by Buddha, Kanâda, Akshapâda,
Jina, Kapila and Patañjali respectively are all mutually contradictory.




12. Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different
way; (we reply that) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> also it follows that (the objection raised) is
not got rid of.

Let us then <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> as follows. The arguments actually <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth
by <span class="t0 t14 t18 t19 t24 hoverable">Buddha</span> and others may have to be considered as invalid, but all the
same we may arrive at the Pradhâna theory through other lines of
reasoning by which the objections raised against the theory are refuted.--
But, we reply, this also is of no avail. A theory which rests
exclusively on arguments derived from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> may, at some other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or place, be disestablished by arguments devised by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> more
skilful than you in reasoning; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there is no getting over the
objection founded on the invalidity of all mere argumentation. The
conclusion from all this is that, with regard to supersensuous matters,
Scripture alone is authoritative, and that reasoning is to be applied
only to the support of Scripture. In agreement herewith Manu says, 'He
who supports the teaching of the Rishis and the doctrine as to sacred
duty with arguments not conflicting with the Veda, he alone truly knows
sacred duty' (Manu XII, 106). The teaching of the Sânkhyas which
conflicts with the Veda cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for the purpose of
confirming and elucidating the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Veda.--Here finishes the
section treating of 'difference of nature.'




13. Thereby also the remaining (theories) which are not comprised
(within the Veda) are explained.

Not comprised means those theories which are not known to be comprised
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> (countenanced by) the Veda. The Sûtra means to say that by the
demolition given above of the Sânkhya doctrine which is not comprised
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Veda the remaining theories which are in the same position,
viz. the theories of Kanâda, Akshapâda, Jina, and Buddha, must likewise
be considered as demolished.

Here, however, a new objection may be raised, on the ground namely that,
since all these theories agree in the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of atoms constituting the
general cause, it cannot be said that their reasoning as to the causal
substance is ill-founded.--They indeed, we reply, are agreed to that
extent, but they are all of them equally founded on Reasoning only, and
they are seen to disagree in many ways as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the atoms
which by different schools are held to be either fundamentally void or
non-void, having either a merely cognitional or an objective existence,
being either momentary or permanent, either of a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> or the
reverse, either real or unreal, &c. This disagreement proves all those
theories to be ill-founded, and the objection is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> disposed of.--Here
finishes the section of 'the remaining (theories) non-comprised (within
the Veda).'




14. If it be said that from (Brahman) becoming an enjoyer, there follows
non-distinction (of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the individual soul); we reply--it may
be as in ordinary life.

The Sânkhya here comes forward with a new objection. You maintain, he
says, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> has the character either of a cause or an
effect according as it has for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> sentient and non-sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
in either their subtle or gross state; and that this explains the
difference in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and Brahman. But such
difference is not possible, since Brahman, if embodied, at once becomes
an enjoying subject (just like the individual soul). For if, possessing
a body, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> necessarily experiences all pain and pleasure due to
embodiedness, no less than the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> does.--But we have, under
I, 2, 8, refuted the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the Lord's being liable to experiences of
pleasure and pain!--By no means! There you have shown only that the
Lord's abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of a creature so as to constitute the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of its devotion does not imply fruition on his part of pleasure
and pain. Now, however, you maintain that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is embodied just like
an individual soul, and the unavoidable inference from this is that,
like that soul, he undergoes pleasurable and painful experiences. For we
observe that embodied souls, although not capable of participating in
the changing states of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> such as childhood, old age, &c., <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
experience pleasures and pains caused by the normal or abnormal
condition of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> constituting the body. In agreement with this
Scripture says, 'As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he possesses a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> there is for him no
escape from pleasure and pain; but when he is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> then
neither pleasure nor pain touches him' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 1). As thus,
the theory of an embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constituting the universal cause does
not allow of a distinction in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and the individual
soul; and as, further, the theory of a mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (i.e. an absolutely
homogeneous Brahman) leads to the conclusion that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the abode
of all the imperfections attaching to the world, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as a

fashioned out of it; we maintain that the theory of the Pradhâna being
the general cause is the more valid one.

To this objection the Sûtra replies in the words, 'it may be, as in
ordinary life.' The desired distinction in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and

himself also experiences the pleasure and pain due to the observance or

give a different explanation of this Sûtra. According to them it refutes

distinction of enjoying subjects and objects of enjoyment cannot be
accounted for--proving the possibility of such distinction by means of
the analogous instance of the sea and its waves and flakes of foam. But
this interpretation is inappropriate, since for those who hold that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> proceeds from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> connected with some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or Nescience or
a limiting adjunct (upâdhi) no such primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> can arise. For on
their theory the enjoying subject is that which is conditioned by the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or Nescience or upâdhi inhering in the causal substance, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or Nescience or upâdhi is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of enjoyment; and as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
are of different nature, they cannot <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> over into each other. The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself undergoing an essential change (on which that primâ
facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> might possibly be held to arise) is not admitted by those
philosophers; for Sûtra II, 1, 35 teaches that the individual souls and
their deeds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a stream which has no beginning (so that the
distinction of enjoying subjects and objects of enjoyment is eternal).
But even if it be held that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself undergoes a change, the doubt
as to the non-distinction of subjects and objects of enjoyment does not
arise; for the distinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> groups will, on that view, be
analogous to that of jars and platters which are modifications of the
one substance clay, or to that of bracelets and crowns fashioned out of
the one substance gold. And on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself undergoing a
change there arises a further difficulty, viz. in so far as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
(which is nothing but pure non-conditioned intelligence) is held to
transform itself into (limited) enjoying souls and (non-sentient)
objects of enjoyment.




15. The non-difference (of the world) from that (viz. Brahman) follows
from what begins with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ârambhana.

Under II, 1, 7 and other Sûtras the non-difference of the effect, i.e.
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> from the cause, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> was assumed, and it was on this
basis that the proof of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the cause of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> proceeded.
The present Sûtra now raises a primâ facie objection against that very
non-difference, and then proceeds to refute it.

On the point in question the school of Kanâda argues as follows. It is
in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> possible that the effect should be non-different from the
cause. For cause and effect are the objects of different ideas: the
ideas which have for their respective objects threads and a piece of
cloth, or a lump of clay and a jar, are distinctly not of one and the
same kind. The difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> supplies a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> argument; nobody
applies to mere threads the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'piece of cloth,' or vice versâ. A
<span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> argument rests on the difference of effects: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is not fetched
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> in a lump of clay, nor is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> built with jars. There,
fourthly, is the difference of time; the cause is prior in time, the
effect posterior. There is, fifthly, the difference of form: the cause
has the shape of a lump, the effect (the jar) is shaped like a belly
with a broad basis; clay in the latter condition only is meant when we
say 'The jar has gone to pieces.' There, sixthly, is a numerical
difference: the threads are many, the piece of cloth is one only. In the
seventh place, there is the uselessness of the activity of the producing
agent (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result from cause and effect being identical); for if
the effect were nothing but the cause, what could be effected by the
activity of the agent?--Let us then say that, although the effect _exists_
(at all times), the activity of the agent must be postulated as helpful
towards the effect.--But in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the activity of the agent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
have to be assumed as taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> perpetually, and as hence everything
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> exist always, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no distinction between <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> and
non-eternal things!--Let us then say that the effect, although always
existing, is at first non-manifest and then is manifested through the
activity of the agent; in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that activity will not be purposeless,
and there will be a distinction between <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> and non-eternal things!--
This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> also is untenable. For if that manifestation requires another
manifestation (to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for it) we are driven into a _regressus in
infinitum_. If, on the other hand, it is independent of another
manifestation (and hence eternal), it follows that the effect also is
eternally perceived. And if, as a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> alternative, the manifestation
is said to originate, we lapse into the asatkâryavâda (according to
which the effect does not exist before its origination). Moreover, if
the activity of the agent serves to manifest the effect, it follows that
the activity devoted to a jar will manifest also waterpots and similar
things. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which admittedly possess manifesting power, such as
lamps and the like, are not observed to be restricted to particular
objects to be manifested by them: we do not see that a lamp lit for
showing a jar does _not_ at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> manifest waterpots and other
things. All this proves that the activity of the agent has a purpose in
so far only as it is the cause of the origination of an effect which
previously did _not_ exist; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the theory of the previous
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the effect cannot be upheld. Nor does the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of definite
causes having to be employed (in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to produce definite effects; clay
e.g. to produce a jar) prove that that only which already exists can
become an effect; for the facts explain themselves also on the
hypothesis of the cause having definite potentialities (determining the
definite effect which will result from the cause).

But, an objection is raised, he also who holds the theory of the
previous non-existence of the effect, can really do nothing with the
activity of the agent. For as, on his view, the effect has no <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
before it is originated, the activity of the agent must be supposed to
operate elsewhere than on the effect; and as this 'elsewhere' comprises
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> distinction all other things, it follows that the agent's
activity with reference to threads may give rise to waterpots also (not
only to cloth).--Not so, the Vaiseshika replies. Activity applied to a
certain cause gives rise to those effects only the potentiality of which
inheres in that cause.

Now, against all this, the following objection is raised. The effect is
non-different from the cause. For in reality there is no such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as
an effect different from the cause, since all effects, and all empirical
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech about effects, are based on Nescience. Apart from the
causal substance, clay, which is seen to be present in effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
such as jars, the so-called effect, i.e. the jar or pot, rests
altogether on Nescience. All effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> whatever, such as jars,
waterpots, &c., viewed as different from their causal substance, viz.
clay, which is perceived to exist in these its effects, rest merely on
empirical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech, and are fundamentally false, unreal; while
the causal substance, i.e. clay, alone is real. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the
entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in so far as viewed apart from its cause, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
which is nothing but pure non-differenced Being, rests exclusively on
the empirical assumption of Egoity and so on, and is false; while
reality belongs to the causal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is mere Being. It follows
that there is no such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as an effect apart from its cause; the
effect in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is identical with the cause. Nor must you <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to our
theory on the ground that the corroborative instance of the silver
erroneously imagined in the shell is inappropriate because the non-
reality of such effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as jars is by no means <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> proved while
the non-reality of the shell-silver is so proved; for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> it is determined by reasoning that it is the causal substance of
jars, viz. clay, only that is real while the reality of everything apart
from clay is disproved by reasoning. And if you ask whereupon that
reasoning rests, we reply--on the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the clay only is continuous,
permanent, while everything different from it is discontinuous, non-
permanent. For just as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the snake-rope we observe that the
continuously existing rope only--which forms the substrate of the
imagined snake--is real, while the snake or cleft in the ground, which
is non-continuous, is unreal; so we conclude that it is the permanently
enduring clay-material only which is real, while the non-continuous
effects, such as jars and pots, are unreal. And, further, since what is
real, i. e. the Self, does not perish, and what is altogether unreal, as
e.g. the horn of a hare, is not perceived, we conclude that an effected
thing, which on the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> is perceived and on the other is liable to
destruction, must be viewed as something to be defined neither as that
which is nor as that which is not. And what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> undefinable, is
false, no less than the silver imagined in the shell, the
anirvakanîyatva of which is proved by perception and sublation (see
above, p. 102 ff.).--We further ask, 'Is a causal substance, such as
clay, when producing its effect, in a non-modified state, or has it
passed over into some special modified condition?' The former
alternative cannot be allowed, because thence it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the
cause originates effects at all times; and the latter must equally be
rejected, because the passing over of the cause into a special <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> oblige us to postulate a previous passing over into a different
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> (to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the latter passing over) and again a previous one,
&c., so that a _regressus in infinitum_ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result.--Let it then be
said that the causal substance when giving rise to the effect is indeed
unchanged, but connected with a special operative cause, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
(this connexion accounting for the origination of the effect).--But this
also we cannot allow; for such connexion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be with the causal
substance either as unchanged or as having entered on a changed
condition; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the difficulties stated above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> arise again.--
Nor may you say that the origination of jars, gold coins, and sour milk
from clay, gold, and milk respectively is actually perceived; that this
perception is not sublated with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and place--while, on the
other hand, the perception of silver in the shell is so sublated--and
that hence all those who trust perception must necessarily admit that
the effect _does_ originate from the cause. For this argumentation does
not stand the test of being <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in definite alternatives. Does the
mere gold, &c., by itself originate the svastika-ornament? or is it the
gold coins (used for making ornaments) which originate? or is it the
gold, as forming the substrate of the coins [FOOTNOTE 434:1]? The mere
gold, in the first place, cannot be originative as there exists no
effect different from the gold (to which the originative activity could
apply itself); and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> cannot possibly display originative activity
with regard to itself.--But, an objection is raised, the svastika-

different from the gold; for the gold is recognised in it, and no other

proved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of there being a different idea, a different word,
and so on!--By no means, we reply. Other ideas, words, and so on, which
have reference to an altogether undefined <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> are founded on error, no
less than the idea of, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> denoting, shell-silver, and hence

<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> place, is the _gold coin_ originative of the svastika-ornament;
for we do not perceive the coin in the svastika, as we do perceive the
threads in the cloth. Nor, in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> place, is the effect originated
by the gold in so far as being the substrate of the coin; for the gold
in so far as forming the substrate of the coin is not perceived in the
svastika. As it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears that all effects viewed apart from their
causal substances are unreal, we arrive at the conclusion that the
entire world, viewed apart from Brahman, is also something unreal; for
it also is an effect.

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to facilitate the understanding of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that everything
apart from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is false, we have so far reasoned on the assumption
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as clay, gold, &c., being real, and have thereby proved
the non-reality of all effects. In truth, however, all special causal
substances are unreal quite as much as jars and golden ornaments are;
for they are all of them equally effects of Brahman.

'In that all this has its Self; it is the True' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 7);

become all, whereby then should he see and whom should he see?' (Bri. Up.
II, 4, 13); 'Indra goes manifold by means of his mâyâs' (Bri. Up. II, 5,
19);--these and other similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> teach that whatever is different

by Scripture can be in conflict with Perception; for in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth above we prove that all effects are false, and moreover Perception
really has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> pure Being only (cp. above, p. 30). And if
there is a conflict between the two, superior force belongs to Scripture,
to which no imperfection can be attributed; which occupies a final
position among the means of knowledge; and which, although dependent on
Perception, and so on, for the apprehension of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of

Hence it
follows that everything different from Brahman, the general cause, is
unreal.

Nor must this conclusion be objected to on the ground that from the
falsity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> it follows that the individual souls also are non-
real. For it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself which constitutes the individual souls:

'There is no other seer but he' (Bri. Up. III, 3, 23); and others.--But
if you maintain that the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in all living
bodies, it follows that any particular pain or pleasure should affect
the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of all embodied beings, just as an agreeable sensation
affecting the foot gives rise to a feeling of pleasure in the head; and
that there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no distinction of individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and Lord, released

and so on.

Now, in reply to this, some of those who hold the non-duality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
give the following explanation. The many individual souls are the
reflections of the one Brahman, and their states of pain, pleasure, and
so on, remain distinct owing to the different limiting adjuncts (on
which the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of each individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as such depends), in the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the many reflected images of one and the same face in
mirrors, crystals, sword-blades, &c., remain distinct owing to their
limiting adjuncts (viz. mirrors, &c.); one image being small, another
large, one being bright, another dim, and so on.--But you have said that
scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Having entered with this living Self show that
the souls are not different from Brahman!--They are indeed not different
in reality, but we maintain their distinction on the basis of an
imagined difference.--To whom then does that imagination belong? Not to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> surely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> nature, consisting of pure intelligence, allows no

depending on imagination and that imagination residing in the soul! Not
so, the advaita-vâdin replies. Nescience (wrong imagination) and the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> an endless retrogressive chain; their
relation is like that of the seed and the sprout. Moreover, mutual
dependence and the like, which are held to constitute defects in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of real things, are unable to disestablish Nescience, the very
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of which consists in being that which cannot rationally be
established, and which hence may be compared to somebody's swallowing a

a magical illusion). In reality the individual souls are non-different
from Brahman, and hence essentially <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all impurity; but as they
are liable to impurity caused by their limiting adjuncts--in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the face reflected in a mirror is liable to be dimmed by the
dimness of the mirror--they may be the abodes of Nescience and hence may
be viewed as the figments of wrong imagination. Like the dimness of the
reflected face, the imperfection adhering to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is a mere error;
for otherwise it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> can never obtain release.
And as this error of the souls has proceeded from all eternity, the
question as to its cause is not to be raised.

This, we reply, is the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of teachers who have no insight into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of aduality, and are prompted by the wish of capturing the
admiration and applause of those who believe in the doctrine of duality.
For if, as a first alternative, you should maintain that the abode of
Nescience is constituted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its essential, not fictitiously
imagined, form; this means that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself is the abode of Nescience.
If, in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> place, you should say that the abode of Nescience is
the soul, viewed as different from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and fictitiously imagined in

Nescience. For those who hold the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Non-duality do not acknowledge
a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> aspect different from these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> (i.e. from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is pure

abode of Nescience is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its essential nature, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>

negative this also, since that which has an absolutely homogeneous

establishing a basis for the distinction of bondage and release, but it
really is quite unable to effect this. For if by Release be understood
the destruction of Nescience, it follows that when one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> attains

is not destroyed will remain in Bondage!--You now argue on the
assumption of a special avidyâ for each soul. But what about the
distinction of souls implied therein? Is that distinction essential to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the soul, or is it the figment of Nescience? The former
alternative is excluded, as it is admitted that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> essentially is
pure, non-differenced intelligence; and because on that alternative the
assumption of avidyâ to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the distinction of souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
purposeless. On the latter alternative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> subordinate alternatives
arise--Does this avidyâ which gives rise to the fictitious distinction
of souls belong to Brahman? or to the individual souls?--If you say 'to
Brahman', your <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> coincides with mine.--Well then, 'to the souls'!--
But have you then quite forgotten that Nescience is assumed for the
purpose of accounting for the distinction of souls?--Let us then <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> as follows--those several avidyâs which are assumed for the
purpose of establishing the distinction of souls bound and released, to
those same avidyâs the distinction of souls is due.--But here you <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
in a manifest circle: the avidyâs are established on the basis of the
distinction of souls, and the distinction of souls is established when
the avidyâs are established. Nor does the argument of the seed and
sprout apply to the present question. For in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of seeds and
plants each several seed gives rise to a different plant; while in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under discussion you adopt the impossible procedure of establishing
the several avidyâs on the basis of the very souls which are assumed to
be due to those avidyâs. And if you attempt to give to the argument a
somewhat different turn, by maintaining that it is the avidyâs abiding
in the earlier souls which fictitiously give rise to the later souls, we
point out that this implies the souls being short-lived only, and
moreover that each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> itself the consequences
of deeds not its own and escape the consequences of its own deeds. The
same reasoning disposes of the hypothesis that it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which
effects the fictitious <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the subsequent souls by means of the
avidyâs abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the earlier souls. And if there is assumed a
beginningless flow of avidyâs, it follows that there is also a
beginningless flow of the condition of the souls dependent on those
avidyâs, and that steady uniformity of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of the souls which is
supposed to hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> up to the moment of Release could <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not be
established. Concerning your assertion that, as Nescience is something
unreal and hence altogether unproved, it is not disestablished by such
defects as mutual dependence which touch real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only; we remark
that in that <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> Nescience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cling even to released souls and the

for its essence pure cognition!--Is Nescience then to be dealt with by
rational arguments? If so, it will follow that, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
arguments <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth (mutual dependence, and so on), it likewise does not
cling to the individual souls. We further put the following question--
When the Nescience abiding in the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> passes away, owing to
the rise of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of truth, does then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also perish or
does it not perish? In the former <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> Release is nothing else but
destruction of the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the soul; in the latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> does not attain Release even on the destruction of Nescience, since
it continues to exist as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> different from Brahman.--You have further
maintained that the distinction of souls as pure and impure, &c., admits
of being accounted for in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the dimness or clearness, and
so on, of the different images of a face as seen reflected in mirrors,
crystals, sword-blades and the like. But here the following point
requires consideration. On what occasion do the smallness, dimness and
other imperfections due to the limiting adjuncts (i.e. the mirrors, &c.)
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away?--When the mirrors and other limiting adjuncts themselves <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
away!--Does then, we ask, the reflected image which is the substrate of
those imperfections persist or not? If you say that it persists, then by
analogy the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also must be assumed to persist, and from
this it follows that it does not attain Release. And if the reflected
image is held to perish <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its imperfections, by analogy the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also will perish and then Release will be nothing but annihilation.--
Consider the following point also. The destruction of a non-advantageous
(apurushârtha) defect is of advantage to him who is conscious of that
disadvantage. Is it then, we ask, in the given <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> Brahman--which
corresponds to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> reflected--that is conscious of the
imperfections due to the limiting adjuncts? or is it the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which
corresponds to the reflected image? or is it something else? On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
former alternatives it appears that the comparison (between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> on the one hand, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> reflected and the reflection on
the other--on which comparison your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> theory is founded) does not
hold good; for neither the face nor the reflection of the face is
conscious of the imperfections due to the adjuncts; for neither of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> is a being capable of consciousness. And, moreover, Brahman's being
conscious of imperfections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply its being the abode of Nescience.
And the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> alternative, again, is impossible, since there is no other
knowing subject _but_ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the soul.--It would, moreover, be
necessary to define who is the imaginatively shaping agent (kalpaka)
with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as formed from Nescience. It cannot be Nescience
itself, because Nescience is not an intelligent principle. Nor can it be
the soul, because this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply the defect of what has to be proved
being presupposed for the purposes of the proof; and because the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is that which _is formed_ by Nescience, just as
shell-silver is. And if, finally, you should say that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the
fictitiously forming agent, we have again arrived at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that is
the abode of Nescience.--If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not allowed to be the abode of
Nescience, we further must ask <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> sees (is conscious of)
the individual souls or not. If not, it is not possible that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
should give rise to this manifold <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> which, as Scripture declares,
is preceded by 'seeing' on his part, and to the differentiation of names
and forms. If, on the other hand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is of an absolutely
homogeneous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> sees the souls, it cannot do so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Nescience;
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> we are again led to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Nescience abiding in Brahman.

For similar reasons the theory of the distinction of Mâya and Nescience
must also be abandoned. For even if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> possesses Mâyâ, i.e.
illusive power, it cannot, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Nescience, be conscious of souls. And
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being conscious of others the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of Mâyâ is unable to delude
them by his Mâyâ; and Mâyâ herself cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of others on the part of its Lord, for it is a mere means to delude
others, after they have (by other means) become objects of consciousness.--
Perhaps you will say that the Mâyâ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> causes him to be conscious
of souls, and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is the cause of those souls' delusion.
But if Mâyâ causes Brahman--which is nothing but self-illuminated
intelligence, absolutely homogeneous and <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all foreign elements--
to become conscious of other beings, then Mâyâ is nothing but another
name for Nescience.--Let it then be said that Nescience is the cause of
the cognition of what is contrary to truth; such being the case, Mâyâ
which presents all false <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> different from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as false, and

avidyâ.--But this is inadmissible; for, when the oneness of the moon is
known, that which causes the idea of the moon being double can be
nothing else but avidyâ. Moreover, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> recognises all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
apart from himself as false, he does not delude them; for surely none
but a madman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> aim at deluding <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> known by him to be unreal!--
Let us then define avidyâ as the cause of a disadvantageous cognition of
unreal things. Mâyâ then, as not being the cause of such a
disadvantageous cognition on Brahman's part, cannot be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
avidyâ!--But this also is inadmissible; for although the idea of the
moon being double is not the cause of any pain, and hence not
disadvantageous to man, it is all the same caused by avidyâ; and if, on
the other hand, Mâyâ which aims at dispelling that idea (in so far as it
presents the image and idea of one moon) did not present what is of
disadvantage, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be something to be destroyed, and hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

what harm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> there be?--The harm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that such a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> implies

is not in real conflict with the texts!--Brahman, we reply, has for its

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arrive at the conclusion that those who hold the non-duality of

beginningless avidyâ, and owing to this avidyâ is conscious of plurality

avidyâ belonging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that he is unable to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the
distinction of bondage and release, for as there is only the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
affected with Nescience and to be released by the cessation of that
Nescience, the distinction of souls bound and released, &c., has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
existence: the empirical distinction of souls bound and released, of
teachers and pupils, &c. is a merely fictitious one, and all such
fiction can be explained by means of the avidyâ of one intelligent being.
The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> dreaming: the teachers and
pupils and all the other persons and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he may see in his dream are
fictitiously shaped out of the avidyâ of the one dreaming subject. For
the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> there is no valid foundation for the assumption of many
avidyâs. For those also who hold that avidyâ belongs to the individual
souls do not maintain that the distinction of bondage and release, of
one's own self and other persons, is real; and if it is unreal it can be
accounted for by the avidyâ of one subject. This admits of being stated
in various technical ways.--The distinctions of bondage and of one's own
self and other persons are fictitiously shaped by one's own avidyâ; for
they are unreal like the distinctions seen by a dreaming person.--Other
bodies also have a Self through me only; for they are bodies like this
my body.--Other bodies also are fictitiously shaped by my avidyâ; for
they are bodies or effects, or non-intelligent or fictitious creations,
as this my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> class of intelligent subjects is nothing
but _me_; for they are of intelligent nature; what is _not me_ is seen
to be of non-intelligent nature; as e.g. jars.--It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> follows that the
distinctions of one's own self and other persons, of souls bound and
released, of pupils and teachers, and so on, are fictitiously <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by
the avidyâ of one intelligent subject.

The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that the upholder of Duality himself is not able to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
for the distinction of souls bound and released. For as there is an
infinity of past aeons, it follows that, even if one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only should
attain release in each aeon, all souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> have attained
release; the actual <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of non-released souls cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be
rationally accounted for.--But the souls are 'infinite'; this accounts
for there being souls not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> released!--What, pray, do you understand
by this 'infinity' of souls? Does it mean that they cannot be counted?
This we cannot allow, for although a being of limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> may not
be able to count them, owing to their large number, the all-knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
surely can count them; if he could not do so it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that he is
not all-knowing.--But the souls are really numberless, and the Lord's
not knowing a definite <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> which does not exist does not prove that
he is not all-knowing!--Not so, we reply. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> which are definitely
separate (bhinna) from each other cannot be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> number. Souls have a
number, because they are separate; just as mustard seeds, beans, earthen
vessels, pieces of cloth, and so on. And from their being separate it
moreover follows that souls, like earthen vessels, and so on, are non-
intelligent, not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Self, and perishable; and it further
follows therefrom that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not infinite. For by infinity we
understand the absence of all limitation. Now on the theory which holds
that there is a plurality of separate existences, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is
considered to differ in character from other existences cannot be said
to be <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from substantial limitation; for substantial limitation means
nothing else than the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of other substances. And what is
substantially limited cannot be said to be <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from temporal and
spatial limitation; for observation shows that it is just those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
which differ in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> are substantially
limited--such as earthen vessels, and so on--which are also limited in
point of space and time. Hence all intelligent existences, including
Brahman, being substantially limited, are also limited in point of space
and time. But this conclusion leads to a conflict with those scriptural
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all limitation whatsoever

The dvaita-view <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being found untenable on all sides, we adhere to
our doctrine that this entire world, from Brahmâ down to a blade of

is 'non-different' from Brahman.

To this the Dvaitavâdin, i.e. the Vaiseshika, replies as follows. The
doctrine that Brahman, which in itself is pure, non-differenced self-
illuminedness, has its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> hidden by avidyâ and hence sees
plurality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself, is in conflict with all the valid means of
right knowledge; for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts, obscuration, i.e.
cessation, of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean complete destruction of
Brahman; so that the hypothesis of obscuration is altogether excluded.
This and other arguments have been already <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth; as also that the
hypothesis of obscuration contradicts other views held by the Advaitin.
Nor is there any proof for the assertion that effects apart from their
causes are mere error, like shell-silver, the separate <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the
effect being refuted by Reasoning; for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> there is no
valid reasoning of the kind. The assertion that the cause only is real
because it persists, while the non-continuous effects--such as jars and
waterpots--are unreal, has also been refuted before, on the ground that
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> not existing at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> does not
sublate its real <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> at another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and place. Nor is there any
soundness in the argumentation that the effect is false because, owing
to its being perceived and its being perishable, it cannot be defined
either as real or unreal. For a thing's being perceived and its being
perishable does not prove the thing's falseness, but only its non-
permanency. To prove a thing's falseness it is required to show that it
is sublated (i.e. that its non-existence is proved by valid means) with
reference to that very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in connexion with which it is
perceived; but that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is sublated with reference to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> _other_ than those in connexion with which it is perceived, proves
only that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> does not exist in connexion with that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time,
but not that it is false. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> also may be put in technical form,
viz. effects such as jars and the like are real because they are not
sublated with regard to their definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and time; just as the Self
is.--Nor is there any <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in the assertion that the effect cannot
originate from the cause either modified or unmodified; for the effect
may originate from the cause if connected with certain favouring
conditions of place, time, &c. Nor can you show any proof for the
assertion that the cause, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> modified or non-modified, cannot enter
into connexion with such favouring conditions; as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> the
cause may very well, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being modified, enter into such connexion.--
But from this it follows that the cause must have been previously
connected with those conditions, since previously also it was equally
unmodified!--Not so, we reply. The connexion with favouring conditions
of time, place, &c., into which the cause enters, depends on some other
cause, and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> on the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of its not being modified. No fault
then can be found with the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the cause, when having entered into a
special <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> depending on its connexion with time, place, &c.,
producing the effect. Nor can it be denied in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the cause
possesses originative agency with regard to the effect; for such agency
is actually observed, and cannot be proved to be irrational.--Further
there is no proof for the assertion that originative agency cannot
belong either to mere gold or to a (first) effect of gold such as coined
gold, or to gold in so far as forming the substrate for coins and the
like; for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> mere gold (gold in general), if connected
with the helpful factors mentioned above, may very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> possess
originative capacity. To say that we do not perceive any effect
different from gold is futile; for as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> we perceive the
svastika-ornament which is different from mere gold, and the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
of different terms and ideas moreover proves the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of different
things. Nor have we here to do with a mere error analogous to that of
shell-silver. For a real effected thing, such as a golden ornament, is
perceived during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> period intervening between its origination
and destruction, and such perception is not sublated with regard to that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and place. Nor is there any valid line of reasoning to sublate that
perception. That at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the previously non-perceived
svastika-ornament is perceived the gold also is recognised, is due to
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the gold persisting as the substrate of the ornament, and
hence such recognition of the causal substance does not disprove the
reality of the effect.--And the attempts to prove the unreality of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by means of scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> we have already disposed of in a
previous part of this work.

We further <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to the assertion that it is one Self which bestows on
all bodies the property of being connected with the Self; as from this
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is conscious of all the pains and
pleasures caused by all bodies. For, as seen in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Saubhari and
others, it is owing to the oneness of the Self that one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is
conscious of the pains and pleasures due to several bodies. Nor again
must you allege that the non-consciousness (on the part of one Self of
all pleasures and pains whatever), is due to the plurality of the Egos,
which are the subjects of cognition, and not to the plurality of Selfs;
for the Self is none other than the subject of cognition and the Ego.
The organ of egoity (ahamkâra), on the other hand, which is the same as
the internal organ (antahkarana), cannot be the knowing subject, for it
is of a non-intelligent nature, and is a mere instrument like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
and the sense-organs. This also has been proved before.--Nor is there
any proof for your assertion that all bodies must be held to spring from
the avidyâ of one subject, because they are bodies, non-intelligent,
effects, fictitious. For that all bodies are the fictitious creations of
avidyâ is not true; since that which is not sublated by valid means of
proof must be held to be real.--Nor again can you uphold the assertion
that all intelligent subjects are non-different, i.e. one, because we
observe that whatever is other than a subject of cognition is non-
intelligent; for this also is disproved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the plurality of
intelligent subjects as proved by the individual distribution, among
them, of pleasures and pains.--You have further maintained 'Through me
only all bodies are animated by a Self; they are the fictitious
creations of _my_ avidyâ; _I_ alone constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of
intelligent subjects,' and, on the basis of these averments, have
attempted to prove the oneness of the Ego. But all this is nothing but
the random talk of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has not mastered even the principles of
his own theory; for according to your theory the Self is pure
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> to which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> distinction of 'I,' 'Thou,' &c., is
altogether foreign. Moreover, if it be held that everything different
from pure, non-differenced <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is false, it follows that all
effort spent on learning the Veda with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to Release is fruitless,
for the Veda also is the effect of avidyâ, and the effort spent on it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is analogous to the effort of taking hold of the silver
wrongly imagined in the shell. Or, to put it from a different point of
view, all effort devoted to Release is purposeless, since it is the
effect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> depending on teachers of merely fictitious existence.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> produced by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that' does not put an end
to bondage, because it is produced by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which are the fictitious
product of avidyâ; or because it is itself of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of avidyâ; or
because it has for its abode knowing subjects, who are mere creatures of
avidyâ; or because it is the product of a process of study which depends
on teachers who are the mere creatures of avidyâ; it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no better
than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> resting on <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> teaching how bondage is to be put an end
to, which one might have <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in a dream. Or, to put the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> again
from a different point of view, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constituted by pure non-
differenced <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> is false, since it is to be attained by
knowledge, which is the effect of avidyâ; or since it is to be attained
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> abiding in knowing subjects who are mere figments of avidyâ;
or because it is attained through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which is the mere figment of
avidyâ. For whatever is attained through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of that kind is false;
as e.g. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen in dreams or a town of the Gandharvas (Fata
Morgana).

Nor does Brahman, constituted by pure non-differenced intelligence,
shine forth by itself, so as not to need--for its cognition--other means
of knowledge. And that that self-luminous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which you declare to
be borne witness to by itself, really consists in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
particular objects of knowledge--such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> abiding in particular
cognising subjects--this also has been proved previously. And the
different arguments which were <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth as proving Brahman's non-
differenced nature, are sufficiently refuted by what we have said just
now as to all such arguments themselves being the products of avidyâ.

Nor again is there any <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> in the theory that the principle of non-
differenced <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> 'witnesses' avidyâ, and implicates itself in
the error of the world. For 'witnessing' and error are observed to abide
only in definite conscious subjects, not in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in general.
Nor can that principle of pure <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> be proved to possess
illumining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> depending on itself only. For by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
(enlightenment) we can understand nothing but definite well-established
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (siddhi) on the part of some knowing subject with regard to
some particular object. It is on this basis only that you yourself prove
the self-illuminedness of your universal principle; to an absolutely non-
differenced <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> not implying the distinction of subject and
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> such 'svayamprakâsatâ' could not possibly belong. With regard
again to what you so loudly proclaim at your meetings, viz. that real
effects are seen to spring even from unreal causes, we point out that
although you allow to such effects, being non-sublatcd as it were, a
kind of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'empirical' (or 'conventional'--vyâvahârika),
you yourself acknowledge that fundamentally they are nothing but
products of avidyâ; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> undermine your own position. We have, on
the other hand, already disposed of this your <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> above, when proving
that in all cases effects are originated by real causes only. Nor may
you plead that what perception tells us in such cases is contradicted by
Scripture; for as, according to you, Scripture itself is an effect, and
hence of the essence of avidyâ, it is in no better <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> than the
instances quoted. You have further declared that, although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to
be attained only through unreal knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is real since when
once attained it is not sublated by any subsequent cognition. But this
reasoning also is not valid; for when it has once been ascertained that
some principle is attained through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> resting on a vicious basis,
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that we are not aware of a subsequent sublation of that
principle is irrelevant. That the principle 'the reality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is a
universal Void' is false, we conclude therefrom that the reasoning
leading to that principle is ascertained to be ill-founded, although we
are not aware of any subsequent <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> sublating that principle. Moreover,
for <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'There is here no plurality whatsoever', 'Knowledge,
bliss is Brahman,' the absence of subsequent sublation is claimed on the
ground that they negative the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> different from

(which had established that aggregate of things). But somebody may rise
and say 'the Reality is a Void', and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> negative the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the
principle of mere <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">Intelligence</span> also; and the latter principle is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
sublated by the assertion as to the Void, which is later in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> than
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which it negatives. On the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the assertion as to the
Void being the universal principle is not liable to subsequent sublation;
for it is impossible for any negation to go beyond it. And as to resting
on a vicious basis, there is in that respect no difference between
Perception and the other means of knowledge, and the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of general
unreality, founded on the Vedânta. The proper conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is
that all cognitions whatsoever abide in real subjects of cognition and
are themselves real, consisting in mental certainty with regard to
special objects. Some of these cognitions rest on defects which
themselves are real; others spring from a combination of causes, real
and <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all defect. Unless we admit all this we shall not be able

Against our opponent's argument that pure Being must be held the real
substrate of all erroneous superimposition (adhyâsa), for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
that no error can exist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a substrate, we remark that an error may

error may exist even when the defect (giving rise to the error), the
abode of the defect, the subject of cognition and the cognition itself
are unreal. The argument <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> loses its force. Possibly he will now
argue that as an error is never seen to exist where the substrate is
unreal, the reality of pure Being (as furnishing the required basis for
error) must necessarily be admitted. But, we point out, it also is a
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that errors are never observed where the defect, the abode of the
defect, the knowing subject and the act of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> are unreal; and if
we pay regard to observation, we must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> admit the reality of all
these factors as well. There is really no difference between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
cases, unless our opponent chooses to be obstinate.

You further asserted that, on the theory of many really different Selfs,
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow from the infinity of the past aeons that all souls must
have been released before this, none being <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage;
and that hence the actually observed distinction of souls bound and
released remains unexplained. But this argumentation is refuted by the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the souls also being infinite. You indeed maintained that, if
the souls are really separate, they must necessarily have a definite
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> like beans, mustard-seeds, earthen vessels, and so on; but these
instances are beside the point, as earthen vessels, and so on, are also
infinite in number.--But do we not actually see that all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
have definite numbers, 'Here are ten jars; a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> beans,' &c.?--True,
but those numbers do not belong to the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of jars, and so
on, but only to jars in so far as connected with time, place, and other
limiting adjuncts. And that souls also have definite numbers in this
sense, we readily admit. And from this it does not follow that all souls
should be released; for essentially the souls are infinite (in number).--
Nor are you entitled to maintain that the real separation of individual
souls <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply that, as earthen vessels and the like, they are non-
intelligent, not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Self, and perishable. For the
circumstance of individuals of one species being distinct from each
other, does in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> imply that they possess the characteristics of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> belonging to another species: the individual separation of jars
does not imply their having the characteristics of pieces of cloth.--You
further maintain that from the hypothesis of a real plurality of souls
it follows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is substantially limited, and in consequence of
this limited with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and space also, and that hence its
infinity is disproved. But this also is a mistaken conclusion. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span>
substantially limited may be limited more or less with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
and place: there is no invariable rule on this point, and the measure of
their connexion with space and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has hence to be determined in
dependence on other means of knowledge. Now Brahman's connexion with _all_
space and _all_ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> results from such other means of proof, and hence
there is no contradiction (between this non-limitation with regard to
space and time, and its limitation in point of substance--which is due
to the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of other souls).--But mere substantial limitation, as
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> the absence of non-limitation of any kind, by itself proves that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not infinite!--Well, then you yourself are in no better case;
for you admit that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is something different from avidyâ. From this
admission it follows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also is something 'different', and

to your theory as well. If on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> it should not be allowed
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from avidyâ, then Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> itself
is constituted by avidyâ, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> defining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as 'the True,
knowledge, infinite' is contrary to sense.--If the reality of
'difference' is not admitted, then there is no longer any distinction

of different theories, and we are landed in general confusion. The proof
of infinity, we further remark, rests altogether on the absence of
limitation of space and time, not on absence of substantial limitation;
absence of such limitation is something very much akin to the 'horn of a
hare' and is perceived nowhere. On the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of difference, on the other
hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world, as constituting Brahman's body, is its mode, and

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arrive at the conclusion that, as effects are real in so far as
different from their cause, the effect of Brahman, i.e. the entire world,
is different from Brahman.

Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra now declares itself as follows.--The non-

here be explained as that which is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> or touched (â-rabh = â-labh;
and 'âlambhah sparsahimsayoh'); compare Pânini III, 3, 113, as to the

mean 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of activity preceded by speech'; for activities such as
the fetching of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in a pitcher are preceded by speech,'Fetch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

material clay (which had been mentioned just before) touches (enters
into contact with) an effect (vikâra), i.e. a particular make or
configuration, distinguished by having a broad bottom and resembling the
shape of a belly, and a special name (nâmadheya), viz. _pitcher_, and so
on, which is applied to that effect; or, to put it differently, to the
end that certain activities may be accomplished, the substance clay
receives a new configuration and a new name. [FOOTNOTE 455:1] Hence jars
and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of clay are clay (mrittikâ), i.e. are of the substance

authoritative means of proof; _only_ (eva), because the effects are not
known as different substances. One and the same substance therefore,
such as clay or gold, gives occasion for different ideas and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> only
as it assumes different configurations; just as we observe that one and
the same Devadatta becomes the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of different ideas and terms, and
gives rise to different effects, according to the different stages of
life--youth, old age, &c.--which he has reached.--The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of our saying
'the jar has perished' while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the clay persists, was referred to by
the Pûrvapakshin as proving that the effect is something different from
the cause; but this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is disproved by the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> held by us that
origination, destruction, and so on, are merely different states of one
and the same causal substance. According as one and the same substance
is in this or that state, there belong to it different terms and
different activities, and these different states may rightly be viewed
as depending on the activity of an agent. The objections again which are
connected with the theory of 'manifestation' are refuted by our not
acknowledging such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> at all as 'manifestation.' Nor does the
admission of origination render the doctrine of the reality of the
effect irrational; for it is only the Real that originates.--But it is a
contradiction to maintain that that which previously exists is
originated!--This, we reply, is the objection of a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who knows
nothing about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of origination and destruction. A
substance enters into different states in succession; what passes away
is the substance in its previous states, what originates is the
substance in its subsequent states. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the substance in all its
states has being, there is nothing irrational in the satkârya theory.--
But the admission of the origination of a non-existing <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> lands us in
the asatkârya theory!--If he, we retort, who holds the asatkârya theory
is of opinion that the origination of the effect does not itself
originate, he is similarly landed in the satkârya theory; and if he
holds that the origination itself originates, he is led into a
_regressus in infinitum_. According to us, on the other hand, who hold
that states are incapable of being apprehended and of acting apart from
that of which they are states, origination, destruction, and so on,
belong only to a substance which is in a certain state; and on this
theory no difficulty remains. And in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of being
a jar results from the clay abandoning the condition of being either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
halves of a jar or a lump of clay, plurality results from a substance
giving up the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of oneness, and oneness from the giving up of
plurality; hence this point also gives rise to no difficulty.

We now consider the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Chândogya-text in connexion. 'Sad eva somyedam
agra âsîd ekam evâdvitîyam.' This means--That which is Being, i.e. this

manifold shape, was in the beginning one only, owing to the absence of
the distinction of names and forms. And as, owing to the 'Sat' being
endowed with all powers, a further ruling principle is out of the
question, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was also 'without a second.' This proves the non-

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the next clause
also,' It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,' which describes the

and immovable, viz. Fire, and so on, enables us to determine that the
effect, i. e. the world, is non-different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> cause, i.e.
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.

attributes of being a jar or pitcher or platter; and the different
effects of these attributes are distributed among different parts of the
substance, clay. The objects of enjoyment, subjects of enjoyment, and

Smriti, Itihâsa, Purâna and Reasoning. For Scripture, Smriti, Itihâsa

being that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all Lords, all-knowing, all-powerful,

'Being' is admitted to be an element of the Lord; and moreover all
'Being' has difference. Nor can it be maintained that the Lord's
connexion with all his auspicious qualities--knowledge, bliss, and so
on--is occasional (adventitious) merely; it rather is essential and
hence eternal. Nor may you avail yourself of certain texts--viz. 'His

knowing, all-cognising' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9), and others--to the end of
proving that what is essential is only the Lord's connexion with the
_potentialities_ (sakti) of knowledge, bliss, and so on. For in the
Svetâsvatara-text the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'essential' independently qualifies
'knowledge, strength, and action' no less than 'sakti'; and your

have this limited meaning; and in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of pâkaka and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>

imply the stultification of all those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> to be

fully present in all its parts, and hence also in that part which is the
Lord, all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> may be viewed as having their Self in and being
parts of, him.--But from your principles we might with equal right draw
the inference that as Being in general is fully present in the jar, the

such as 'the jar is,' 'the cloth is,' it appears that Being is an
attribute of things, and cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be a substance and a cause. By
the 'being' of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> we understand the attribute of its being suitable
for some definite practical effect; while its 'non-being' means its
suitability for an effect of an opposite nature.--Should it on the other
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> be held that substances only have being, the (unacceptable)
consequence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that actions, and so on, are non-existent. And if
(to avoid this consequence) it were said that the being of actions, and
so on, depends on their connexion with substances, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult

following doubt may arise. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of childhood, youth, and so on,
we observe that different ideas and different terms are applied to
different states of one and the same being; in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of clay, wood,
gold, &c., on the other hand, we observe that different ideas and terms
are applied to different things. On what ground then do you determine
that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of causes and effects, such as e.g. clay and jars, it
is mere difference of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> on which the difference of ideas and terms
is based?--To this question the next Sûtra gives a reply.

This means--because gold which is the cause is perceived in the

recognition of the gold in the earring is due to generic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
_things_ being different, but having the same generic nature); for we
perceive no new substance which could be the abode of the generic
character. What we actually perceive is one and the same substance
possessing the generic characteristics of gold, first in the causal
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> and then in the effected state. Nor again can it be said that even
on the supposition of difference of substance, recognition of the cause
in the effect results from the continuity of the so-called intimate
cause (samavâyi-kâraina). For where there is difference of substances
we do not observe that mere continuity of the abode gives rise to the
recognition (of one substance) in the other substance residing in that
abode.-But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of certain effects, as e.g. scorpions and other
vermin which originate from dung, that recognition of the causal
substance, i.e. dung (to which you refer as proving the identity of
cause and effect), is not observed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place!--You misstate the
case, we reply; here also we _do_ recognise in the effect that substance
which is the primal cause, viz. earth.--But in smoke, which is the
effect of fire, we do not recognise fire!--True! but this does not
disprove our case. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> is only the operative cause of smoke; for smoke
originates from damp fuel joined with fire. That smoke is the effect of
damp fuel is proved thereby, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that both have smell (which
shows them to be alike of the substance of earth).--As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the identity
of the substance is perceived in the effect also, we are entitled to
conclude that the difference of ideas and terms rests on difference of
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> only. The effect, therefore, is non-different from the
cause.--This is so for the following <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also.

in the cause--for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also the effect is non-different from the
cause. For in ordinary language as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the Veda the effect is
spoken of in terms of the cause; as when we say, 'all these things--jars,
platters, &c.--were clay only this morning'; or when the Veda says,
'Being only was this in the beginning.'




18. If it be said 'not, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the designation of the (effect as
the) non-existent; we reply, not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> (of such designation
being due to) another attribute, (as appears) from the complementary
passage, from Reasoning, and from another Vedic text.

The assertion that ordinary speech as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Veda acknowledges the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the effect in the cause cannot be upheld 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
designation of (the effect as) the non-existent.' For the Veda says,
'Non-being only was this in the beginning' (Ch. Up. III, 19, 1); 'Non-
being indeed was this in the beginning' (Taitt. Up. II, 6. 1); 'In the
beginning truly this was not anything whatever.' And in ordinary
language we say 'In the morning all this--jars, platters, and so on,--
was not.'--This objection the Sûtra proceeds to refute. 'Not so, on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of such designation being due to another attribute.' The
designation of the effected substance as the non-existent is due to the
effect having at an earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a different quality, i.e. a different
constitution; not to its being, as you think, absolutely non-existing.
The quality different from the quality of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is non-existence;
that is to say, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> designated as _this_, the quality of
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> is constituted by name and form, while the quality of non-
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> consists in the subtle <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> opposed to name and form.--But
how is this known?--'From the complementary passage, from Reasoning, and
from another text.' The complementary <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is the one following on
the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted above, viz. 'that Non-existent formed the resolve
"may I be". The resolve referred to in this complementary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> serving
as an inferential sign to determine that the Non-existence spoken of is
other than absolute Non-existence, we, on the basis of the observation
that all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> quoted treat of the same matter, conclude that
in the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also the Non-existent has to be understood in the
same sense. 'From Reasoning.' Reasoning shows Being and Non-being to be
attributes of things. The possession, on the part of clay, of a certain
shape, a broad base, a belly-shaped body, and so on, is the cause of our
thinking and saying 'the jar exists,' while the connexion, on the part
of the clay, with a condition opposed to that of a jar is the cause of
our thinking and saying 'the jar does not exist.' A condition of the
latter kind is e. g.--the clay's existing in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> separate
halves of a jar, and it is just this and similar conditions of the clay
which <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for our saying that the jar does not exist. We do not
perceive any non-existence of the jar different from the kind of non-
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> described; and as the latter sufficiently accounts for all
current ideas and expressions as to non-existence, there is no occasion
to assume an additional kind of non-existence.--And also 'from another
text.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> meant is that often quoted, 'Being only was this in the
beginning.' For there the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the absolute non-being of the effect
is objected to, 'But how could it be thus?' &c., and then the decision
is given that from the beginning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was 'being.' This <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is
clearly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'This was then undistinguished; it became

21. From the designation of the 'other' (as non-different from Brahman)
there result (Brahman's) not creating what is beneficial, and other
imperfections.

'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that'; 'this Self is Brahman'--these and similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which

said before, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the non-difference from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of the

<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> really imply that the 'other one,' i.e. the soul, is Brahman,
there will follow certain imperfections on Brahman's part, viz. that
Brahman, endowed as it is with omniscience, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of realising its

originating in living <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> themselves or due to the action of other
natural beings, or caused by supernatural agencies. No rational
independent <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> endeavours to produce what is clearly non-beneficial
to himself. And as you hold the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the non-difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

the doctrine of general non-difference could not be established. Should
it be maintained that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring difference refer to difference
due to limiting adjuncts, while the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring non-difference mean
essential non-difference, we must ask the following question--does the
non-conditioned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> know, or does it not know, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is
essentially non-different from it? If it does not know it, Brahman's
omniscience has to be abandoned. If, on the other hand, it knows it,
then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is conscious of the pains of the soul--which is non-
different from Brahman--as its own pains; and from this there
necessarily follows an imperfection, viz. that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> does not create
what is beneficial and does create what is non-beneficial to itself. If,
again, it be said that the difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is due to
Nescience on the part of both, and that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring difference
refer to difference of this kind, the assumption of Nescience belonging
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> leads us to the very alternatives just stated and to their
respective results. Should the ajñana, on the other hand, belong to
Brahman, we point out that Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is self-

ordination above referred to fully explains itself. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is non-

confusion of the different characteristic qualities; for liability to
change belongs to non-sentient matter, liability to pain to sentient
souls, and the possession of all excellent qualities to Brahman: hence
the doctrine is not in conflict with any scriptural text. That even in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of non-separation-described in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as, 'Being only this

in a subtle condition and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> constitute Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> must
necessarily be admitted; for that the souls at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> also persist in

time, is possible in so far as there is no distinction of names and
forms. It follows from all this that Brahman's causality is not contrary
to reason.

Those, on the other hand, who explain the difference, referred to in
Sûtra 22, as the difference between the jîva in its <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage and
the jîva in so far as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from avidyâ, i.e. the unconditioned Brahman,
implicate themselves in contradictions. For the jiva., in so far as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
from avidyâ, is neither all-knowing, nor the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all, nor the cause
of all, nor the Self of all, nor the ruler of all--it in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> possesses
none of those characteristics on which the scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> found the
difference of the released soul; for according to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> in question
all those attributes are the mere figment of Nescience. Nor again can
the Sûtra under discussion be said to refer to the distinction, from the
individual soul, of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> fictitiously <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by avidyâ--a distinction

in the relation of cause and effect. And the Sûtra II, 1, 7 has

capability of producing certain effects stand in need of certain
instruments, some slow-witted <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> may possibly imagine that Brahman,
being destitute of all such instruments, is incapable of creating the
world. It is this doubt which we have to dispel. It is seen that potters,
weavers, &c., who produce jars, cloth, and the like, are incapable of
actually producing unless they make <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of certain implements, although
they may fully possess the specially required skill. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> destitute of
such skill are not capable of production, even with the help of
implements; those having the capacity produce by means of the
instruments only. This leads to the conclusion that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also,

we know from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Being only this was in the beginning';
'there was Nârayana alone.' Brahman's creative agency <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> cannot be
rendered plausible; and hence the primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the

This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the latter part of the Sûtra, 'not so; for as
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of milk.' It is by no means a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that every agent capable
of producing a certain effect stands in need of instruments. Milk, e.g.
and water, which have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of producing certain effects, viz. sour

is meant to point out the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the proving instances are generally
known, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to indicate the silliness of the objection. Whey and
similar ingredients are indeed sometimes mixed with milk, but not to the
end of making the milk turn sour, but merely in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to accelerate the

26. Or the consequence of the entire (Brahman entering into the effect),
and stultification of (Brahman's) being devoid of parts.

'Being only was this in the beginning'; 'This indeed was in the
beginning not anything'; 'The Self alone indeed was this in the
beginning'--these and other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that in the beginning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
was one only, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts--that means: Brahman, in its causal
state, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts because then all distinction of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and
souls had disappeared. This one, non-divided, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> thereupon having
formed the resolution of being many divided itself into the aggregate of
material things--ether, air, and so on--and the aggregate of souls from
Brahmâ down to blades of grass. This being so, it must be held that the
entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> entered into the effected state; that its
intelligent part divided itself into the individual souls, and its non-
intelligent part into ether, air, and so on. This however stultifies all
those often-quoted <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> to be
devoid of parts. For although the cause is constituted by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so
far as having for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and souls in their subtle state, and
the effect by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> invested with <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and souls in their gross
state; the difficulty stated above cannot be avoided, since also that
element in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is embodied is held to enter into the effect.
If, on the other hand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts, it cannot become many,
and it is not possible that there should persist a part not entering
into the effected state. On the ground of these unacceptable results we
conclude that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be the cause.--This objection the next
Sûtra disposes of.




27. But on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture; (Brahman's possession of various
powers) being founded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the word.

The 'but' sets aside the difficulty raised. There is no
inappropriateness; 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture.' Scripture declares on the
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not made up of parts, and on the other that
from it a multiform <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> proceeds. And in matters vouched for by
Scripture we must conform our ideas to what Scripture actually says.--
But then Scripture might be capable of conveying to us ideas of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
altogether self-contradictory; like as if somebody were to tell us
'Water with fire'!--The Sûtra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> adds 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being
founded on the word.' As the possession, on Brahman's part, of various
powers (enabling it to emit the world) rests exclusively on the
authority of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of the Veda and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> differs altogether from other
matters (which fall <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere of the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
also), the admission of such powers is not contrary to reason. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

If attributes belonging to one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> were on that <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> to be ascribed

sentient things, such as jars and the like, belong also to the
intelligent <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> Self, which is of an altogether different kind. But
that such attributes do not extend to the Self is due to the variety of
the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of things. This the Sûtra expresses in 'for (there
are) manifold (powers).' We perceive that fire, water, and so on, which
are of different kind, possess different powers, viz. heat, and so on:
there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> nothing unreasonable in the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

Parâsara also--in reply to a question founded on ordinary observation--
viz. 'How can creative energy be attributed to Brahman, devoid of
qualities, pure, &c.?'--declares 'Numberless powers, lying beyond the
sphere of all ordinary thought, belong to Brahman, and qualify it for
creation, and so on; just as heat belongs to fire.' Similarly, Scripture
says, 'what was that wood, what was that tree from which they built
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and earth?' &c. (Ri. Samh. X, 81); and 'Brahman was that wood,

On his view, i.e. on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of him who holds the theory of the
Pradhâna or something similar, the imperfections observed in ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> attach themselves to the Pradhâna also, since it does not
differ in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from those things. The legitimate conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only which differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> can
be held to be the general cause.

The Pradhâna, moreover, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts; how then is it possible that
it should give rise to a manifold world, comprising the 'great principle,'
and so on?--But there _are_ parts of the Pradhâna, viz. Goodness,
Passion, and Darkness!--This we reply necessitates the following
distinction. Does the aggregate of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness
constitute the Pradhâna? or is the Pradhâna the effect of those three?
The latter alternative is in conflict with your own doctrine according
to which the Pradhâna is cause only. It moreover contradicts the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span>
of tattvas (viz. 24) admitted by you; and as those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas also have
no parts one does not see how they can produce an effect. On the former
alternative, the gunas not being composed of parts must be held to
aggregate or join themselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any reference to difference of
space, and from such conjunction the production of gross effects cannot
result.--The same objection applies to the doctrine of atoms being the
general cause. For atoms, being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts and spatial distinction of
parts, can join only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any reference to such spatial distinction,
and hence do not possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of originating effects.

all powers, 'realising all its wishes, realising all its intentions', &c.
(Ch. Up. VIII, 1, 5). Compare also 'He, consisting of mind, having prana

(before).

effect and no instrument,' that as it is destitute of instruments it
cannot produce any effect.--To this objection an answer has already been

the only means of knowledge, and which is different from all other

33. But (it is) mere sport, as in ordinary life.

The motive which prompts Brahman--all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> wishes are fulfilled and who

nothing else but sport, play.

It must indeed be admitted that the Lord, who differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from all
other beings, intelligent and non-intelligent, and hence possesses
powers unfathomable by thought, is capable of creating this manifold
world, although before <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> he is one only and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts. But
the assumption of his having actually <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lay him
open to the charge of partiality, in so far as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> contains <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>

his creatures experience pain of the most dreadful kind.--The reply to
this is 'not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of there being regard'; i.e. 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of

beings, gods, and so on, about to be created.'--Sruti and Smriti alike
declare that the connexion of the individual souls with bodies of
different kinds--divine, human, animal, and so on--depends on the karman
of those souls; compare 'He who performs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> becomes good, he who

bad deeds' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 5). In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the reverend Parâsara
declares that what causes the difference in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and status between
gods, men, and so on, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the former deeds of the souls
about to enter into a new creation--'He (the Lord) is the operative
cause only in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of new beings; the material cause is
constituted by the potentialities of the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> to be created. The being
to be embodied requires nothing but an operative cause; it is its own
potentiality which leads its being into that condition of being (which
it is to occupy in the new creation).' Potentiality here means karman.




35. If it be said 'not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-distinction of deeds'; we
say, 'not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of beginninglessness'; this is reasonable, and
it is also observed.

But before <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> the individual souls do not exist; since Scripture
teaches non-distinction 'Being only this was in the beginning.' And as
then the souls do not exist, no karman can exist, and it cannot
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be said that the inequality of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> depends on karman.--Of
this objection the Sûtra disposes by saying 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
beginninglessness,' i.e. although the individual souls and their deeds
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> an <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> stream, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a beginning, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> non-distinction of them
'is reasonable' (i.e. may reasonably be asserted) in so far as, previous
to creation, the substance of the souls abides in a very subtle
condition, destitute of names and forms, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> incapable of being
designated as something apart from Brahman, although in reality then
also they constitute Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only. If it were not admitted (that
the distinctions in the new <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> are due to karman), it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
moreover follow that souls are requited for what they have not done, and
not requited for what they have done. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the souls being

intelligent one is not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> and dies not' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18); so also
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the flow of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> going on from all eternity, 'As the
creator formed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and moon formerly.' Moreover, the text, 'Now all this
was then undeveloped. It became developed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and name' (Bri. Up. I,
4, 7), states merely that the names and forms of the souls were
developed, and this shows that the souls themselves existed from the
beginning. Smriti also says, 'Dost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> know both Prakriti and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

XIII, 19.)--As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> differs

alone can be the universal cause.




36. And because all the attributes are proved (to be present in Brahman).

As all those attributes required to constitute causality which have been
or will be shown to be absent in the Pradhâna, the atoms, and so on, can
be shown to be present in Brahman, it remains a settled conclusion that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only is the cause of the world. Here terminates the adhikarana
of 'that which has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of depending on a motive.'




<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">SECOND</span> PÂDA.

1. Not that which is inferred, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of
construction, and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of activity.

The Sûtras have so far <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the doctrine that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
is the cause of the origination and so on of the world, and have refuted
the objections raised by others. They now, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to safeguard their
own position, proceed to demolish the positions held by those very
adversaries. For otherwise it might happen that some slow-witted persons,
unaware of those other views resting on mere fallacious arguments, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
imagine them possibly to be authoritative, and hence might be somewhat
shaken in their belief in the Vedic doctrine. Another pâda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is
begun to the express end of refuting the theories of others. The
beginning is made with the theory of Kapila, because that theory has
several features, such as the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the effect in the
cause, which are approved of by the followers of the Veda, and hence is
more likely, than others, to give rise to the erroneous <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of its
being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine. The Sûtras I, 1, 5 and ff. have proved only
that the Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the Sânkhya view, while the task
of the present pâda is to demolish that <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> itself: the Sûtras cannot
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be charged with needless reiteration.

The outline of the Sânkhya doctrine is as follows. 'There is the
fundamental Prakriti, which is not an effect; there are the seven
effects of Prakriti, viz. the Mahat and so on, and the sixteen effects
of those effects; and there is the soul, which is neither Prakriti nor
effect'--such is the comprehensive statement of the principles. The
entity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'fundamental Prakriti' is constituted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
substances <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, (when) in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
complete equipoise, none of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> being either in defect or in
excess; the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> consists respectively in
pleasure, pain, and dullness; they have for their respective effects
lightness and illumination, excitement and mobility, heaviness and
obstruction; they are absolutely non-perceivable by means of the senses,
and to be defined and distinguished through their effects only. Prakriti,
consisting in the equipoise of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas is one, itself
non-sentient but subserving the enjoyment and final release of the many
sentient beings, eternal, all-pervading, ever active, not the effect of
anything, but the one general cause. There are seven Principles which
are the effects of Prakriti and the causal substances of everything else;
these seven are the Mahat, the ahankâra, the subtle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> (tanmâtra) of
sound, the subtle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of touch, the subtle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of colour, the
subtle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of taste, and the subtle <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of smell. The ahankâra is
threefold, being either modified (vaikârika), or active (taijasa), or
the originator of the elements (bhûtâdi).

The vaikârika is of sattva-nature and the originator of the sense--
organs; the bhûtâdi is of tamas--nature, and the cause of those subtle
matters (tanmâtra) which in their turn are the cause of the gross
elements; the taijasa is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of ragas, and assists the other
two. The five gross elements are the ether and so on; the five
intellectual senses are hearing and so on; the five organs of action are
speech and so on. With the addition of the internal organ (manas) these
are the sixteen entities which are mere effects.--The soul, not being
capable of any change, is not either the causal <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> or the effect of
anything. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> attributes, consisting of
mere intelligence, eternal, non-active, all-pervading, and different in
each body. Being incapable of change and non-active, it can neither be
an agent nor an enjoyer; but although this is so, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in their confusion
of mind, due to the closeness to each other of Prakriti and the soul,
erroneously attribute to Prakriti the <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the soul, and to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> the activity of Prakriti--just as the redness of the rose
superimposes itself on the crystal near it,--and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> consider the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
to be an 'I' and an enjoyer. Fruition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> results from ignorance, and
release from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the truth. This their theory the Sânkhyas
prove by means of perception, inference, and authoritative tradition.
Now with regard to those matters which are proved by perception, we
Vedântins have no very special <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for dissenting from the Sânkhyas;
and what they say about their authoritative tradition, claiming to be
founded on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all-knowing persons such as Kapila, has been
pretty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> disproved by us in the first adhyâya. If, now, we further
manage to refute the inference which leads them to assume the Pradhâna
as the cause of the--world, we shall have disestablished their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
theory. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> proceed to give this refutation.

On this point the Sânkhyas <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> as follows. It must necessarily be
admitted that the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has one cause only; for if effects were
assumed to originate from several causes we should never arrive at an
ultimate cause. Assume that parts such as e.g. threads produce a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
(i.e. in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of threads, a piece of cloth) in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of their
being joined <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> by means of their six sides, which are parts of
the threads. You must then further assume that the threads themselves
are in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> produced by their parts, having a similar
constitution. And these parts again by their parts, until you reach the
atoms; these also must be assumed to produce their immediate effects by

also as being wholes, consisting of parts [FOOTNOTE 482:1], must be
viewed as produced by their parts, and these again by their parts and so
on, so that we never arrive at an ultimate cause. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to
establish such an ultimate cause we must have recourse to the hypothesis
of the general cause being constituted by one substance, which possesses
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of transforming itself in various different ways, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> at

general substrate for an infinity of different effects, from the Mahat
downwards. This one general cause is the Pradhâna constituted by the
equipoise of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas. The reasons for the assumption of this
Pradhâna are as follows:--'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the limitedness of particular
things; of connexion (anvaya); of activity proceeding from special power;
and of the difference and non-difference of cause and effect--the Non-
evolved (Pradhâna) is the general cause of this many-natured Universe'
(vaisvarûpya) (Sânkhya Kâ. I, 15; 16).--The term 'vaisvarûpya' denotes
that which possesses all forms, i.e. the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with its variously
constituted parts--bodies, worlds, and so on. This world, which on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its variegated constitution must be held to be an effect, has
for its cause the Unevolved (avyakta = Prakriti), which is of the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the world. Why so? Because it is an effect; for we perceive
that every effect is different from its special cause--which has the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the effect--and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is non-different.

their causes, i.e. clay and gold, which have the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the

again merged in it: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> has the Pradhâna alone for its cause.
This Pradhâna is constituted by the equipoise of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas, and

the world; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of pleasure, pain, and
dullness, which consist of sattva, rajas, and tamas respectively. The
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of a jar consisting of clay; of that also the
cause is none other than the substance clay. For in every <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
observation shows that only such causal substances as are of the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the effects possess that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the origination
of the effect. That the general cause can be found only in the unevolved
Pradhâna, which consists of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of equipoise and
is unlimited with regard to space as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as time, follows from the
limitedness of the particular things, viz. the Mahat, the ahankâra, and
so on. These latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are limited like jars and so on, and hence
incapable of originating the entire world. Hence it follows that this
world, consisting of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas, has for its only cause the
Pradhâna, which is constituted by those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of
equipoise.

Against this argumentation the Sûtra says, 'Not that which is inferred,
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of construction, and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
activity.'--'Inference' means 'that which is inferred,' i.e. the
Pradhâna. The Pradhâna postulated by you is not capable of constructing
this manifold-natured world, because while itself being non-intelligent
it is not guided by an intelligent being understanding its nature.
Whatever is of this latter kind is incapable of producing effects; as e.
g. wood and the like by themselves are not capable of constructing a
palace or a carriage. As it is <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of observation that non-
intelligent wood, not guided by an intelligent agent understanding its
nature, cannot produce effects; and as it is observed that if guided by
such an agent <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> does enter on action so as to produce effects; the
Pradhâna, which is not ruled by an intelligent agent, cannot be the
general cause. The 'and' in the Sûtra is meant to add as a further
argument that 'presence' (anvaya) has no proving force. For whiteness
present in cows and so on is not invariably accompanied by the quality
of being the cause of the class characteristics of cows. Nor must it be
said that qualities such as whiteness, although present in the effect,
may not indeed be causes, but that substances such as gold and the like
which are present in certain effects are invariably accompanied by the
quality of being causes, and that hence also the substances <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
sattva, rajas, and tamas, which are found present in all effects, are
proved to be the causes of all those effects. For sattva and so on are
attributes of substances, but not themselves substances. Sattva and so
on are the causes of the lightness, light, &c.. belonging to substances
such as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the like, and hence distinctive attributes of the
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of those substances, but they are not observed to be
present in any effects in a substantial form, as clay, gold, and other
substances are. It is for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that they are known as 'gunas.'
You have further said that the world's having one cause only must be
postulated in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that an ultimate cause may be reached. But as the
sattva, rajas, and tamas are not one but three, you yourself do not
assume one cause, and hence do not manage to arrive at an ultimate cause.
For your Pradhâna consists in the equipoise of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas; there
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> several causes, and you have no more an ultimate cause than
others. Nor can you say that this end is accomplished through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
gunas being unlimited. For if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas are all alike unlimited,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> omnipresent, there is nowhere a plus or minus of any of
them, and as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no inequality can result, effects cannot originate. In
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to explain the origination of results it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> necessary to
assume limitation of the gunas.

Nor is our <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> confirmed by those cases only in which it is clearly
perceived that <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> produces effects only when guided by an
intelligent principle; other cases also (where the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is not perceived
with equal clearness) are in favour of our view. This the next Sûtra
declares.

[FOOTNOTE 482:1. As follows from their having six sides.]




2. If it be said--like milk or water; there also (intelligence guides).

What has been said--the Sânkhya rejoins--as to the impossibility of the
Pradhâna not guided by an intelligent principle constructing this
variously constituted world, is unfounded; for the Pradhâna may be
supposed to act in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as milk and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> do. Milk, when turning
into sour milk, is capable of going by itself through a series of

spontaneously proceeds to transform itself into the various saps and
juices of different plants, such as palm trees, mango trees, wood-apple
trees, lime trees, tamarind trees, and so on. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the

modify itself into many various effects due to the loss of equilibrium
on the part of the gunas. As has been said '(the Pradhâna acts), owing
to modification, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> according to the difference of the abodes of
the several gunas' (Sânkhya Kâ. I, 16). In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Unevolved acts
independently of anything else.

To this reasoning the Sûtra replies 'there also.' Also, in the instances
of milk and water, activity is not possible in the absence of an
intelligent principle, for these very cases have already been referred
to as proving our position. The Sûtra II, 1, 24 (where the change of
milk into sour milk is instanced) meant to prove only that a being
destitute of other visible instruments of action is able to produce its
own special effect, but not to disprove the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of all agency
presupposing an intelligent principle. That even in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and so on an
intelligent principle is present is proved by scriptural texts, 'he who
dwells in water' and so on.




3. And because from the independence (of the Pradhâna) there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
follow the non-existence of what is different (from creation, i.e. of
the pralaya condition).

That the Pradhâna which is not guided by an intelligent principle is not
the universal cause is proved also by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that, if we ascribe to it

with piety, riches, worldly pleasures, and final release; while him who
transgresses his commands he causes to experience the opposites of all
these. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no room whatever for objections founded on
deficiency, on the Lord's part, of independence in his dealings with men,
and the like. Nor can he be arraigned with being pitiless or merciless.
For by pity we understand the inability, on somebody's part, to bear the
pain of others, coupled with a disregard of his own advantage. When pity
has the effect of bringing about the transgression of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> on the part of

charge of unmanliness (weakness), and it is creditable to control and
subdue it. For otherwise it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that to subdue and chastise

is instrumental that he should reprove and reject the infinite and

and endless aeons, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> check the tendency on the part of individual

which is not guided by an intelligent principle, cannot be the general
cause.--Here a further objection is raised. Although Prakriti, as not
being ruled by an intelligent principle, is not capable of that kind of
activity which springs from effort, she may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> be capable of that kind
of activity which consists in mere transformation. For we observe
parallel cases; the grass and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> e.g. which are consumed by a cow
change on their own <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> into milk. In the same way, then, Prakriti
may on her own <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> transform herself into the world.--To this the
next Sûtra replies.




4. Nor like grass and so on; because (milk) does not exist elsewhere.

This argumentation does not hold good; for as grass and the like do not
transform themselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the guidance of an intelligent principle,
your proving instance is not established.--But why is it not established?--
'Because it does not exist elsewhere.' If grass, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and so on changed
into milk even when consumed by a bull or when not consumed at all, then
indeed it might be held that they change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the guidance of an
intelligent principle. But nothing of the kind takes place, and hence we
conclude that it is the intelligent principle only which turns the grass
eaten by the cow into milk.--This point has been <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth above under
Sûtra 3; the present Sûtra is meant to emphasise and particularise it.




5. And if you say--as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the stone; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> also.

Here the following <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> might be urged. Although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> consists of

owing to the mere nearness of the soul. For we observe parallel

to the nearness to him of some lame <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of motion but

And through the nearness of the magnetic stone iron moves. In the same

and the soul. As has been said, 'In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may know the
Pradhâna and become isolated, the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> like
that of the lame and the blind; and thence <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> springs' (Sânkhya Kâ.
21). This means--to the end that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may experience the Pradhâna,
and for the sake of the soul's emancipation, the Pradhâna enters on
action at the beginning of creation, owing to the nearness of the soul.

To this the Sûtra replies 'thus also.' This means--the inability of the
Pradhâna to act remains the same, in spite of these instances. The lame
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is indeed incapable of walking, but he possesses various other
powers--he can see the road and give instructions regarding it; and the
blind man, being an intelligent being, understands those instructions
and directs his steps accordingly. The magnet again possesses the
attribute of moving towards the iron and so on. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> on the other
hand, which is absolutely inactive, is incapable of all such changes. As,
moreover, the mere nearness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the Pradhâna is something
eternal, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> also is eternal. If, on the
other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is held to be eternally free, then there can be no
bondage and no release.




6. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of the relation of principal (and
subordinate) matter.

You Sânkhyas maintain that the origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> results from a
certain relation between principal and subordinate entities which
depends on the relative inferiority and superiority of the gunas--
'according to the difference of the abodes of the several gunas'
(Sânkhya Kâ. I, 16).

But, as in the pralaya <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas are in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of equipoise,
none of them being superior or inferior to the others, that relation of
superiority and subordination cannot then exist, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
cannot originate. Should it, on the other hand, be maintained that even
in the pralaya <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> there is a certain inequality, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow
therefrom that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is eternal.




7. And if another inference be made (the result remains unchanged), on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (the Pradhâna) being destitute of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of a knowing
subject.

Even if the Pradhâna were inferred by some reasoning different from the
arguments so far refuted by us, our objections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain in force
because, anyhow, the Pradhâna is devoid of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of a cognising
subject. The Pradhâna <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> cannot be established by any mode of
inference.




8. And even if it be admitted; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of a purpose.

Even if it were admitted that the Pradhâna is established by Inference,
the Sânkhya theory could not be accepted for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that the
Pradhâna is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a purpose. For, according to the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> expressed in
the passage, 'In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may know the Pradhâna and become
isolated' (Sânkhya Kâ. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhâna is fruition
and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible.
For, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> consists of pure intelligence, is inactive, changeless,
and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable neither of
fruition which consists in <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of Prakriti, nor of Release
which consists in separation from Prakriti. If, on the other hand, it be
held that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> constituted as described is, owing to the mere
nearness of Prakriti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being conscious of
pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of Prakriti, it
follows that, as Prakriti is ever near, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> will never accomplish
emancipation.




9. And (it is) objectionable on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the contradictions.

The Sânkhya-system, moreover, labours from many internal contradictions.--
The Sânkhyas hold that while Prakriti is for the sake of another and the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and fruition, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is independent, an enjoying
and knowing agent, and conscious of Prakriti; that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> reaches
isolation through the instrumentality of Prakriti only, and that as its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pure, permanent, unchanging consciousness, absence of all
activity and isolation belong to that nature; that for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the
accomplishing of the means of bondage and release and of release belong
to Prakriti only; and that, owing to Prakriti's proximity to the
unchanging non-active soul, Prakriti, by a process of mutual
superimposition (adhyâsa), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> towards the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and
subserves the purposes of the soul's fruition and emancipation.--'Since
the aggregate of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is for the sake of another; since there is an
opposite of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas and the rest; since there is superintendence;
since there is an experiencing subject; and since there is activity for
the sake of isolation; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> exists' (Sânkhya Kâ. 17); 'And from that
contrast the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is proved to be a witness, isolated, neutral,
cognising and inactive' (18).--And after having stated that the activity
of the Pradhâna is for the purpose of the release of the Self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
says, 'therefore no (soul) is either bound or released, nor does it
migrate; it is Prakriti which, abiding in various beings, is bound and
released and migrates' (62). And 'From this connexion therewith (i.e.
with the soul) the non-intelligent appears as intelligent; and although
all agency belongs to the gunas, the indifferent (soul) becomes an agent.
In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may know the Pradhâna and become isolated, the
connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> like that of the lame and the blind;
and thence <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> springs' (20, 21).--Now to that which is eternally
unchanging, non-active and isolated, the attributes of being a witness
and an enjoying and cognising agent can in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> belong. Nor also can
such a being be subject to error resting on superimposition; for error
and superimposition both are of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of change. And, on the other
hand, they also cannot belong to Prakriti, since they are attributes of
intelligent beings. For by superimposition we understand the attribution,
on the part of an intelligent being, of the qualities of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to
another thing; and this is the doing of an intelligent being, and
moreover a change. Nor is it possible that superimposition and the like
should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only if it is in approximation to Prakriti.--
They may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> just on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the non-changing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the

And if it is maintained that it is Prakriti only that migrates, is bound
and released, how then can she be said to benefit the soul, which is
eternally released? That she does so the Sânkhyas distinctly assert, 'By
manifold means Prakriti, helpful and endowed with the gunas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any
benefit to herself, accomplishes the purpose of the soul, which is
thankless and not composed of the gunas' (Sânkhya Kâ. 60).--The Sânkhyas
further teach that Prakriti, on being seen by any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

herself on the stage withdraws from the soul, so Prakriti withdraws from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when she has manifested herself to it' (59); 'My opinion is
that there exists nothing more sensitive than Prakriti, who knowing "I
have been seen" does not again show itself to the soul' (61). But this
doctrine also is inappropriate. For, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is eternally released
and above all change, it never sees Prakriti, nor does it attribute to
itself her qualities; and Prakriti herself does not see herself since
she is of non-intelligent nature; nor can she wrongly impute to herself
the soul's seeing of itself as her own seeing of herself, for she
herself is non-intelligent and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is incapable of that change
which consists in seeing or knowing.--Let it then be said that the
'seeing' means nothing more than the proximity of Prakriti to the soul!--
But this also does not help you; for, as said above, from that there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> seeing, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are in <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> proximity.
Moreover, the ever unchanging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not capable of an approximation
which does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> an element of its unchanging nature.--Moreover, if
you define the seeing as mere proximity and declare this to be the cause
of Release, we point out that it equally is the cause of bondage--so
that bondage and release <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> both be permanent.--Let it then be said
that what causes bondage is wrong seeing--while intuition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

seeing are nothing but proximity, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>

proximity as nothing more than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and Prakriti!--As

contradictory views the system of the Sânkhyas is untenable.

We finally remark that the arguments here <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth by us at the same

is an eternally unchanging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is pure, non-differenced
intelligence, and which by being conscious of Nescience experiences
unreal bondage and release. For those philosophers can show no more than
the Sânkhyas do how their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> can be conscious of Nescience, can be
subject to adhyâsa, and so on. There is, however, the following
difference between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> theories. The Sânkhyas, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
for the definite individual distribution of birth, death, and so on,
assume a plurality of souls. The Vedântins, on the other hand, do not
allow even so much, and their doctrine is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> all the more irrational.
The assertion that there is a difference (in favour of the Vedântins)
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> doctrines, in so far as the Vedântins hold Prakriti to
be something unreal, while the Sânkhyas consider it to be real, is
unfounded; for pure, homogeneous intelligence, eternally non-changing,
cannot possibly be conscious of anything different from itself, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
it be unreal or real. And if that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is held to be unreal, there
arise further difficulties, owing to its having to be viewed as the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge, of refutation, and so on.

Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the impossibility of construction.'




10. Or in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the big and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> from the short and the atomic.

We have shown that the theory of the Pradhâna being the universal cause
is untenable, since it rests on fallacious arguments, and suffers from
inner contradictions. We shall now prove that the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of atoms
constituting the universal cause is untenable likewise. 'Or in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the big and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> from the short and the atomic' 'Is untenable'
must be supplied from the preceding Sûtra; 'or' has to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'and.' The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the Sûtra is--in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the big
and long, i.e. as the theory of ternary compounds originating from the
short and the atomic, i.e. from binary compounds and simple atoms is
untenable, so everything else which they (the Vaiseshikas) maintain is
untenable; or, in other words--as the theory of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> originating
from atoms through binary compounds is untenable, so everything else is
likewise untenable.--Things consisting of parts, as e.g. a piece of
cloth, are produced by their parts, e.g. threads, being joined by means
of the six sides which are parts of those parts. Analogously the atoms
also must be held to originate binary compounds in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of combining
by means of their six sides; for if the atoms possessed no distinction
of parts (and hence filled no space), a group of even a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> atoms
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not differ in extension from a single atom, and the different
kinds of extension--minuteness, shortness, bigness, length, &c.--would
never emerge. If, on the other hand, it is admitted that the atoms also
have distinct sides, they have parts and are made up of those parts, and
those parts again are made up of their parts, and so on in infinitum.--
But, the Vaiseshika may object, the difference between a mustard seed
and a mountain is due to the paucity of the constituent parts on the one
hand, and their multitude on the other. If, now, it be held that the
atom itself contains an infinity of parts, the mustard seed and the
mountain alike will contain an infinity of parts, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> their
inequality cannot be accounted for. We must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> assume that there
is a limit of subdivision (i.e. that there are real atoms which do not
themselves consist of parts).--Not so, we reply. If the atoms did not
possess distinct parts, there could originate no extension greater than
the extension of one atom (as already shown), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> neither mustard
seed nor mountain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ever be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about.--But what, then, are we
to do to get out of this dilemma?--You have only to accept the Vedic
doctrine of the origination of the world.

Others explain the above Sûtra as meant to refute an objection against
the doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the general cause. But this does not suit
the arrangement of the Sûtras, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply a meaningless iteration.
The objections raised by some against the doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> have been
disposed of in the preceding pâda, and the present pâda is devoted to
the refutation of other theories. And that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> admits of being
viewed as springing from an intelligent principle such as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> was
shown at length under II, 1, 4. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the Sûtra, therefore, is
none other than what we stated above.--But what are those other
untenable views to which the Sûtra refers?--To this question the next
Sûtra replies.




11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being
(of the origination of the world).

The atomic theory teaches that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is produced by the successive
formation of compounds, binary, ternary, and so on, due to the
aggregation of atoms--such aggregation resulting from the motion of the
atoms. The primary motion of the atoms--which are the cause of the
origination of the entire world--is assumed to be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the
unseen principle (adrishta), 'The upward flickering of fire, the sideway
motion of air, the primary motion on the part of atoms and of the manas
are caused by the unseen principle.'--Is then, we ask, this primary
motion of the atoms caused by an adrishta residing in them, or by an
adrishta residing in the souls? Neither alternative is possible. For the
unseen principle which is originated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds of the
individual souls cannot possibly reside in the atoms; and if it could,
the consequence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that the atoms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> constantly produce the
world. Nor again can the adrishta residing in the souls be the cause of
motion originating in the atoms.--Let it then be assumed that motion
originates in the atoms, owing to their being in contact with the souls
in which the adrishta abides!--If this were so, we reply, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be permanently created, for the adrishta, of
the souls forms an <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> stream.-But the adrishta requires to be
matured in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to produce results. The adrishtas of some souls come to
maturity in the same <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> in which the deeds were
performed; others become mature in a subsequent <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> only;
and others again do not become mature before a new Kalpa has begun. It
is owing to this dependence on the maturation of the adrishtas that the
origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at all times.--But this
reasoning also we cannot admit. For there is nothing whatever to
establish the conclusion that all the different adrishtas which spring
from the manifold actions performed at different times, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any
previous agreement, by the infinite multitude of individual Selfs should
reach a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of uniform maturation at one and the same moment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
(so as to give rise to a new creation). Nor does this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of yours
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> being destroyed at the same
time, and remaining in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of non-maturation for the period of a
dviparârdha.--Nor can you say that the motion of the atoms is due to
their conjunction with (souls whose) adrishta possesses certain specific
qualities imparted to them by the will of the Lord; for by mere
inference the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> cannot be proved, as we have shown
under I, 1. The origin of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot, therefore, be due to any
action on the part of the atoms.




12. And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavâya, there results a
_regressus in infinitum_ from equality.

The Vaiseshika doctrine is further untenable on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
acknowledgment of samavâya.--Why so?--Because the samavâya also, like
part, quality, and generic characteristics, requires something else to
establish it, and that something else again requires some further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
to establish it--from which there arises an infinite regress. To explain.
The Vaiseshikas assume the so-called samavâya relation, defining it as
'that connexion which is the cause of the idea "this is here," in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> permanently and inseparably connected, and standing to
each other in the relation of abode and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> abiding in the abode.' Now,
if such a samavâya relation is assumed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> observed to be inseparably connected--as, e.g., class
characteristics are inseparably connected with the individuals to which
they belong--are such, i.e. inseparably connected, a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> has also to
be searched for why the samavâya, which is of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as those
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (in so far, namely, as it is also inseparably connected with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> connected by it), is such; and for that reason, again, a further
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> has to be postulated, and so on, _in infinitum_. Nor can it be
said that inseparable connexion must be assumed to constitute the
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of samavâya (so that no further <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> need be demanded
for its inseparable connexion); for on this reasoning you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to
assume the same essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> for class characteristics, qualities,
and so on (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> render the assumption of a samavâya needless for
them also). Nor is it a legitimate proceeding to postulate an unseen
entity such as the samavâya is, and then to assume for it such and such
an essential nature.--These objections apply to the samavâya <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it
be viewed as <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> or non-eternal. The next Sûtra urges a further
objection against it if viewed as eternal.




13. And because (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> also) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be eternal.

The samavâya is a relation, and if that relation is <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> that to
which the relation belongs must also be eternal, so that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> arrive
at the unacceptable conclusion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is eternal.




14. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (the atoms) having colour and so on, the reverse
(takes place); as it is observed.

From the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that the atoms of four kinds--viz. of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> or air--possess colour, taste, smell, and touch, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow
that the atoms are non-eternal, gross, and made up of parts--and this is
the reverse of what the Vaiseshikas actually teach as to their atoms,
viz. that they are eternal, subtle, and not made up of parts. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
possessing colour, e.g. jars, are non-eternal, because it is observed
that they are produced from other causes of the same, i.e. non-eternal
nature, and so on. To a non-perceived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which is assumed in
accordance with what is actually perceived, we may not ascribe any
attributes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be convenient to us; and it is in accordance with
actual experience that you Vaiseshikas assume the atoms to possess
colour and other qualities. Hence your theory is untenable.--Let it then,
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to avoid this difficulty, be assumed that the atoms do not
possess colour and other sensible qualities. To this alternative the
next Sûtra refers.




15. And as there are objections in both cases.

A difficulty arises not only on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the atoms having colour and
other sensible qualities, but also on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of their being destitute
of those qualities. For as the qualities of effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> depend on
the qualities of their causes, earth, water, and so on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in that
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> be destitute of qualities. And if to avoid this difficulty, it be
held that the atoms do possess qualities, we are again met by the
difficulty stated in the preceding Sûtra. Objections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> arising in
both cases, the theory of the atoms is untenable.




16. And as it is not accepted, it is altogether disregarded.

Kapila's doctrine, although to be rejected on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of it's being in
conflict with Scripture and sound reasoning, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> recommends itself to
the adherents of the Veda on some accounts--as e.g. its <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the effect in the cause. Kanâda's theory, on the other hand,
of which no part can be accepted and which is totally destitute of proof,
cannot but be absolutely disregarded by all those who aim at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
end of man.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the big and long'.




17. Even on the aggregate with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> causes, there is non-
establishment of that.

We so far have refuted the Vaiseshikas, who hold the doctrine of atoms
constituting the general cause. Now the followers of <span class="t0 t14 t18 t19 t24 hoverable">Buddha</span> also teach
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> originates from atoms, and the Sûtras <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> proceed
to declare that on their <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> also the origination, course, and so on,
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot rationally be accounted for. These Bauddhas belong
to four different classes. Some of them hold that all outward things,
which are either elements (bhûta) or elemental (bhautika), and all
inward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (kitta) or mental (kaitta),--all
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> consisting of aggregates of the atoms of earth, water, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
and air--are proved by means of Perception as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Inference. Others
hold that all external things, earth, and so on, are only to be inferred
from ideas (vijñâna). Others again teach that the only reality are ideas
to which no outward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> correspond; the (so-called) outward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
are like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen in dreams. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> schools mentioned agree in
holding that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> admitted by them have a momentary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> only,
and do not allow that, in addition to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> mentioned, viz.
elements and elemental things, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and mental things, there are certain
further independent entities such as ether, Self, and so on.--Others
finally assert a universal void, i.e. the non-reality of everything.

The Sûtras at first dispose of the theory of those who acknowledge the
real <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of external things. Their opinion is as follows. The
atoms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> which possess the qualities of colour, taste, touch and
smell; the atoms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> which possess the qualities of colour, taste
and touch; the atoms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which possess the qualities of colour and
touch; and the atoms of air which possess the quality of touch only,
combine so as to constitute earth, water, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and air; and out of the
latter there originate the aggregates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> bodies, sense-organs, and
objects of sense-organs. And that flow of ideas, which assumes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>

what constitutes the so-called Self. On the agencies enumerated there
rests the entire empiric world.--On this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra remarks, 'Even

consists of bodies, sense-organs and objects, and of which the elements
are the cause--on neither of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> aggregates with their twofold
causes can there be proved establishment of that, i.e. can the
origination of that aggregate which we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> be rationally
established. If the atoms as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the other elements are
held to have a momentary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> only, when, we ask, do the atoms
which perish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a moment, and the elements, move towards combination,
and when do they combine? and when do they become the 'objects of states
of consciousness'? and when do they become the abodes of the activities
of appropriation, avoidance and so on (on the part of agents)? and what
is the cognising Self? and with what objects does it enter into contact
through the sense-organs? and which cognising Self cognises which
objects, and at what time? and which Self proceeds to appropriate which
objects, and at what time? For the sentient subject has perished, and
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of sensation has perished; and the cognising subject has
perished, and the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> cognised has perished. And how can one subject
cognise what has been apprehended through the senses of another? and how
is one subject to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> to itself what another subject has cognised? And
should it be said that each stream of cognitions is one (whereby a kind
of unity of the cognising subject is claimed to be established), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
this affords no sufficient basis for the ordinary notions and activities
of life, since the stream really is nothing different from the
constituent parts of the stream (all of which are momentary and hence
discrete).--That in reality the Ego constitutes the Self and is the
knowing subject, we have proved previously.




18. If it be said that (this) is to be explained through successive
causality; we say 'no,' on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their not being the causes of
aggregation.

'If it be said that through the successive causality of Nescience and so
on, the formation of aggregates and other matters may be satisfactorily
accounted for.' To explain. Although all the entities (acknowledged by
the Bauddhas) have a merely momentary existence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> all that is
accounted for by avidyâ. Avidyâ means that conception, contrary to
reality, by which permanency, and so on, are ascribed to what is
momentary, and so on. Through avidyâ there are originated desire,
aversion, &c., which are comprised under the general term 'impression'
(samskâra); and from those there springs cognition (vijñâna) which
consists in the 'kindling' of mind; from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (kitta) and what is
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (kaitta) and the substances possessing colour, and
so on, viz. earth, water, &c. From that again the six sense-organs,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'the six abodes'; from that the body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'touch' (sparsa);
from that sensation (vedanâ), and so on. And from that again avidyâ, and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> series as described; so that there is an endlessly revolving
cycle, in which avidyâ, and so on, are in turn the causes of the links
succeeding them. Now all this is not possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> those aggregates
of the elements and elemental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> earth, and so on;
and thereby the rationality of the formation of those aggregates is
proved.

To this the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> half of the Sûtra replies 'Not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
(their) not being the causes of aggregation'.--This cannot rationally be
assumed, because avidyâ, and so on, cannot be operative causes with
regard to the aggregation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the other elements and elemental
things. For avidyâ, which consists in the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of permanency and so on,
belonging to what is non-permanent, and desire, aversion and the rest,
which are originated by avidyâ cannot constitute the causes of (other)
momentary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> entering into aggregation; not any more than the
mistaken idea of shell-silver is the cause of the aggregation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
such as shells. Moreover, on the Bauddha doctrine, he who views a
momentary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as permanent himself perishes at the same moment; who
then is the subject in whom the so-called samskâras, i.e. desire,
aversion, and so on, originate? Those who do not acknowledge one
permanent substance constituting the abode of the samskâras have no
right to assume the continuance of the samskâras.




19. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the cessation of the preceding one on the
origination of the subsequent one.

For the following <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also the origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot be
accounted for on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the momentariness of all existence. At the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the subsequent momentary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> originates, the preceding
momentary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> has passed away, and it cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> stand in a
causal relation towards the subsequent one. For if non-existence had
causal power, anything might originate at any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> at any place.--Let it
then be said that what constitutes a cause is nothing else but <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
in a previous moment.--But, if this were so, the previous momentary
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a jar, let us say, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the cause of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
whatever that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be met with in this threefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in the
subsequent moment-cows, buffaloes, horses, chairs, stones, &c.!--Let us
then say that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> existing in a previous moment is the cause only of
those things, existing in the subsequent moment, which belong to the
same species.--But from this again it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that one jar existing
in the previous moment <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the cause of all jars, to be met with in
any place, existing in the following moment!--Perhaps you mean to say
that one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is the cause of one subsequent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> only. But how then
are we to know which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is the cause of which one subsequent thing?--
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> then I say that the momentarily existing jar which exists in a
certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is the cause of that one subsequent momentary jar only
which exists at the very same place!--Very good, then you hold that a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is something permanent! (while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> your doctrine is that there is
nothing permanent).--Moreover as, on your theory, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which has
entered into contact with the eye or some other sense-organ does no
longer exist at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the idea originates, nothing can ever be
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of a cognition.




20. There not being (a cause), there results contradiction of the
admitted principle; otherwise simultaneousness.

If it be said that the effect may originate even when a cause does not
exist, then--as we have pointed out before--anything might originate
anywhere and at any time. And not only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> the origination of the
effect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> remain unexplained, but an admitted principle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also be
contradicted. For you hold the principle that there are four causes
bringing about the origination of a cognition, viz. the adhipati-cause,
the sahakâri-cause, the âlambhana-cause, and the samanantara-cause. The
term adhipati denotes the sense-organs.--And if, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to avoid
opposition to an acknowledged principle, it be assumed that the
origination of a further momentary jar takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the
previous momentary jar still exists, then it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
momentary jars, the causal one and the effected one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be perceived
together; but as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> they are not so perceived. And,
further, the doctrine of general momentariness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be given up.
And should it be said that (this is not so, but that) momentariness
remains, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the connexion of the sense-organ with the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> and the cognition are simultaneous.




21. There is non-establishment of pratisankhyâ and apratisankhyâ
destruction, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-interruption.

So far the hypothesis of origination from that which is not has been
refuted. The present Sûtra now goes on to declare that also the absolute
(niranvaya) destruction of that which is cannot rationally be
demonstrated. Those who maintain the momentariness of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> teach
that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds of destruction, one of a gross kind, which
consists in the termination of a series of similar momentary existences,
and is capable of being perceived as immediately resulting from agencies
such as the blow of a hammer (breaking a jar, e.g.); and the other of a
subtle kind, not capable of being perceived, and taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in a
series of similar momentary existences at every moment. The former is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> pratisankhyâ-destruction; the latter apratisankhyâ-destruction.--
Both these kinds of destruction are not possible.--Why?--On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the non-interruption, i.e. on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of the
complete destruction of that which is. The impossibility of such
destruction was proved by us under II, 1, 14, where we showed that
origination and destruction mean only the assumption of new states on
the part of one and the same permanent substance, and therefrom proved
the non-difference of the effect from the cause.--Here it may possibly
be objected that as we see that a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> when extinguished passes away
absolutely, such absolute destruction may be inferred in other cases
also. But against this we point out that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a vessel of clay
being smashed we perceive that the material, i.e. clay, continues to
exist, and that therefrom destruction is ascertained to be nothing else
but the passing over of a real substance into another state. The proper
assumption, therefore, is that the extinguished <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> also has passed
over into a different state, and that in that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> it is no longer
perceptible may be explained by that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> being an extremely subtle one.




22. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the objections presenting themselves in either
case.

It has been shown that neither origination from nothing, as held by the
advocates of general momentariness, is possible; nor the passing away
into nothing on the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> originated. The acknowledgment of
either of these views gives rise to difficulties. If the effect
originates from nothing, it is itself of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of nothing; for it
is observed that effects share the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of what they originate from.
Pitchers and ornaments, e.g. which are produced from clay and gold
respectively, possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of their causal substances. But you
hold yourself that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not seen to be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

Ether (space) being likewise a mere irrational non-entity, as the
Bauddhas hold it to be. Ether cannot be held to be a mere irrational non-

judgments such as 'here a hawk flies, and there a vulture,' implies our
being conscious of ether as marking the different places of the flight
of the different birds. Nor is it possible to hold that Space is nothing
else but the non-existence (abhâva) of earth, and so on; for this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
collapses as soon as <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in definite alternatives. For <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> we
define Space as the antecedent and subsequent non-existence of earth,
and so on, or as their mutual non-existence, or as their absolute non-

Space. If, in the first place, we define it as the antecedent and
subsequent non-existence of earth, and so on, it will follow that, as
the idea of Space can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not be connected with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
existing at the present moment, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Space.

If, in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> place, we define it as the mutual non-existence of
earth, and so on, it will follow that, as such mutual non-existence
inheres in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only which stand towards each other in the

in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> place, absolute non-existence of earth, and so on, cannot
of course be admitted. And as non-existence (abhâva) is clearly
conceived as a special <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of something actually existing, Space even
if admitted to be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of abhâva, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not on that <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> be

24. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of recognition.

We return to the proof of the, previously mooted, permanence of things.
The 'anusmriti' of the Sûtra means cognition of what was previously
perceived, i.e. recognition. It is a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which were
perceived in the past may be recognised, such recognition expressing
itself in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> 'this is just that (I knew before).' Nor must you say
that this is a mere erroneous assumption of oneness due to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> now perceived being similar to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> perceived before, as
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the flame (where a succession of flames continually
produced anew is mistaken for one continuous flame); for you do not
admit that there is one permanent knowing subject that could have that
erroneous idea. What one <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> has perceived, another cannot judge to
be the same as, or similar to, what he is perceiving himself. If
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> you hold that there is an erroneous idea of oneness due to the
perception of similarity residing in different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> perceived at
different times, you necessarily must acknowledge oneness on the part of
the cognising subject. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the flame there is a valid means
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to prove that there really is a succession of similar
flames, but in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the jar, we are not aware of such a means,
and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have no right to assume that recognition is due to the
similarity of many successive jars.---Perhaps you will here argue as
follows. The momentariness of jars and the like is proved by Perception
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as Inference. Perception in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> presents as its
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which is different from non-present things, in
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as it presents the blue <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> as different from the yellow;
it is in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that we know the difference of the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> from
the past and the future. Inference again proceeds as follows--jars and
the like are momentary because they produce effects and have <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
(sattva); what is non-momentary, such as the horn of a hare, does not
produce effects and does not possess existence. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude
from the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the last momentary jar that the preceding jar-
existences also are perishable, just because they are momentary
existences like the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the last jar.--But both this perception
and this inference have already been disproved by what was said above
about the impossibility of momentary existences standing to one another
in the relation of cause and effect. Moreover, that difference of the
present <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> from the non-present <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> which is intimated by
Perception does not prove the present <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to be a different _thing_
(from the past <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of Perception), but merely its being connected with
the present time. This does not prove it to be a different thing, for
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> can be connected with different times. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> reasons
again which were said to prove the momentariness of jars are invalid
because they may be made to prove just the contrary of what they are
alleged to prove. For we may argue as follows--From <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> and from
their having effects it follows that jars, and so on, are permanent; for
whatever is non-permanent, is non-existent, and does not produce effects,
as e.g. the horn of a hare. The capacity of producing effects can in
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> only to prove non-momentariness on the part of jars, and so
on; for as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> perishing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a moment are not capable of acting,
they are not capable of producing effects. Further, as it is seen in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the last momentary <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> that its destruction is due to a
visible cause (viz. the blow of a hammer or the like), the proper
conclusion is that also the other momentary jars (preceding the last
one) require visible causes for their destruction; and (as no such causes
are seen, it follows that) the jar is permanent and continuous up to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when a destructive cause, such as the blow of a hammer, supervenes.
Nor can it be said that hammers and the like are not the causes of
destruction, but only the causes of the origination of a new series of
momentary existences dissimilar to the former ones--in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
jar, e.g. of a series of momentary fragments of a jar; for we have
proved before that the destruction of jars, and so on, means nothing but
their passing over into a different condition, e.g. that of fragments.
And even if destruction were held to be something different from the
origination of fragments, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> be reasonable to infer, on the
ground of immediate succession in time, that the cause of the
destruction is the blow of the hammer.

Hence it is impossible to deny in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the permanency of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as
proved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of recognition. He who maintains that recognition
which has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the oneness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> connected with
successive points of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has for its objects different things, might as

their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> something different from blue colour. Moreover, for him who
maintains the momentariness of the cognising subject and of the objects
of cognition, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult indeed to admit the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of

another and about which he himself does not know anything.




25. Not from non-entity, this not being observed.

So far we have <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the arguments refuting the views of the
Vaibhâshikas as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Sautrântikas--both which schools maintain
the reality of external things.--Now the Sautrântika comes forward and
opposes one of the arguments <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth by us above, viz. that, on the
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of general momentariness, nothing can ever become an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
cognition, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> which enters into connexion with the sense-
organ is no longer in <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> when the cognition originates.--It is
not, he says, the persistence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> up to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of cognition
which is the cause of its becoming an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of cognition. To be an
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of cognition means nothing more than to be the cause of the
origination of cognition. Nor does this definition imply that the sense-
organs also are the objects of cognition. For a cause of cognition is
held to be an <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of cognition only in so far as it imparts to the
cognition its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> (and this the sense-organs do not). Now even a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> that has perished may have imparted its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> to the cognition, and
on the basis of that form, blue colour, and so on, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself is
inferred. Nor can it be said (as the Yogâkâras do) that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
subsequent cognitions is due to the action of previous cognitions (and
not to the external thing); for on this hypothesis it could not be
explained how in the midst of a series of cognitions of blue colour
there all at once arises the cognition of yellow colour. The manifold
character of cognitions must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be held to be due to the manifold
character of real thing.--To this we reply 'not from non-entity; this
not being observed.' The special forms of cognition, such as blue colour,
and so on, cannot be the forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that have perished, and

observed that when a substrate of attributes has perished, its
attributes <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> over into another thing. (Nor can it be said that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> that perished leaves in cognition a reflection of itself, for)
reflections also are only of persisting things, not of mere attributes.
We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that the manifoldness of cognitions can result
from the manifoldness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only on the condition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span>
persisting at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of cognition.--The Sûtras now <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth a further
objection which applies to both schools.




26. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be accomplishment on the part of non-active

Thus, i.e. on the theory of universal momentariness, origination from
the non-existent, causeless cognition, and so on, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that
persons also not making any efforts may accomplish all their ends. It is
a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> desired and the warding off of

existences momentarily perish, a previously existing thing, or special
attributes of it, such as after-effects (through which Svarga and the
like are effected) or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (through which Release is effected) do
not persist, and hence nothing whatever can be accomplished by effort.
And as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> all effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a cause, even

27. Not non-existence, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of consciousness.

Here now come forward the Yogâkâras, who hold that cognitions (ideas)
only are real. There is no reasonable ground, they say, for the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
that the manifoldness of ideas is due to the manifoldness of things,
since ideas themselves--no less than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> assumed by others--have
their distinct forms, and hence are manifold. And this manifold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of ideas is sufficiently explained by so-called vâsanâ. Vâsanâ means a
flow of ideas (states of consciousness--pratyaya) of different character.
We observe, e.g., that a cognition which has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a jar (i.e. the
idea of a jar) gives rise to the cognition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> halves of a jar,
and is itself preceded and produced by the cognition of a jar, and this
again by a similar cognition, and so on; this is what we <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> a stream
or flow of ideas.--But how, then, is it that internal cognitions have
the forms of external things, mustard-grains, mountains, and so on?--
Even if real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are admitted, the Yogâkâra replies, their becoming
objects of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech depends altogether on the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
knowledge, for otherwise it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that there is no difference
between the objects known by oneself and those known by others. And that
cognitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> shining forth to <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> have forms (distinctive
characteristics) must needs be admitted; for if they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
they could not shine forth. Now we are conscious only of one such form,
viz. that of the cognition; that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> appears to
us as something external (i.e. as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of an outward thing) is due
to error. From the general <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> that we are conscious of ideas and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> only, it follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is not something different from
the idea.

As, moreover, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of one idea specially representing one particular
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> only, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it be a jar or a piece of cloth or anything else,
requires for its explanation an equality in character of the idea and
the thing, those also who hold the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of external <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> must
needs assume that the idea has a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> similar to that of the thing; and
as this suffices for rendering possible practical <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
intercourse, there is nothing authorising us to assume the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in addition to the ideas. Hence cognitions only constitute
reality; external <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> do not exist.

To this the Sûtra replies, 'Not non-existence, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
consciousness.' The non-existence of things, apart from ideas, cannot be
maintained, because we are conscious of cognitions as what renders the
knowing subject capable of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and intercourse with regard to
particular _things_. For the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> taking part in

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> of this kind, as everybody's <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> will testify,

very knowledge, that Reality is constituted by mere knowledge, are fit
subjects for general derision. This point has already been <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in
detail in our refutation of those crypto-Bauddhas who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> shelter under
a pretended Vedic theory.--To maintain, as the Yogâkâras do, that the
general rule of idea and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> presenting themselves <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> proves the
non-difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> from the idea, implies a self-contradiction;
for 'going together' can only be where there are different things. To
hold that it is a general rule that of the idea--the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
which is to make the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to which it refers capable of entering into
common <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and intercourse--we are always conscious <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with
the thing, and then to prove therefrom that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is not different
from the idea, is a laughable proceeding indeed. And as, according to
you, cognitions perish absolutely, and do not possess any permanently
persisting aspect, it is rather difficult to prove that such cognitions
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a series in which each member colours or affects the next one
(vâsanâ); for how is the earlier cognition, which has absolutely
perished, to affect the later one, which has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> arisen? We conclude
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that the manifoldness of cognitions is due solely to the
manifoldness of things. We are directly conscious of cognitions (ideas)
as rendering the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to which they refer capable of being dealt with
by ordinary <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and speech, and the specific character of each
cognition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> depends on the relation which connects it with a
particular thing. This relation is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of conjunction
(samyoga), since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (cognition) also is a substance. Just as
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> (prabhâ), although a substance, stands to the lamp in the relation
of an attribute (guna), so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> stands in the relation of an
attribute to the Self, but, viewed in itself, it is a substance.--From
all this it follows that external <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are not non-existent.

The next Sûtra refutes the opinion of those who attempt to prove the
baselessness of the cognitions of the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> by comparing them to
the cognitions of a dreaming person.




28. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (they are) not like dreams.

Owing to the different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of dream-cognitions, it cannot be said
that, like them, the cognitions of the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> also have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
to correspond to them. For dream-cognitions are originated by organs
impaired by certain defects, such as drowsiness, and are moreover
sublated by the cognitions of the waking state; while the cognitions of
the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> are of a contrary nature. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no equality
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sets.--Moreover, if all cognitions are empty of real
content, you are unable to prove what you wish to prove since your
inferential cognition also is devoid of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> content. If, on the other
hand, it be held to have a real content, then it follows that no
cognition is devoid of such content; for all of them are alike
cognitions, just like the inferential cognition.




29. The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (is) not, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of perception.

The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of mere cognitions devoid of corresponding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is not
possible, because such are nowhere perceived. For we nowhere perceive
cognitions not inherent in a cognising subject and not referring to
objects. That even dream-cognitions are not devoid of real <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> we
have explained in the discussion of the different khyâtis (above, p.
118).--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'perception.'




30. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being unproved in every way.

Here now come forward the Mâdhyamikas who teach that there is nothing
but a universal Void. This theory of a universal Nothing is the real
purport of Sugata's doctrine; the theories of the momentariness of all
existence, &c., which imply the acknowledgment of the reality of things,
were <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth by him merely as suiting the limited intellectual
capacities of his pupils.--Neither cognitions nor external objects have
real existence; the Void (the 'Nothinj') only constitutes Reality, and
final Release means passing over into Non-being. This is the real <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
of Buddha, and its <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is proved by the following considerations. As
the Nothing is not to be proved by any argument, it is self-proved. For
a cause has to be assigned for that only which _is_. But what _is_ does
not originate either from that which is or that which is not. We never
observe that which is to originate from Being; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as jars,
and so on, do not originate as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the lump of clay, &c., is non-
destroyed. Nor can Being originate from Non-being; for if the jar were
supposed to originate from Non-being, i.e. that non-being which results
from the destruction of the lump of clay, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> itself be of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Non-being. Similarly it can be shown that nothing can
originate either from itself or from anything else. For the former
hypothesis <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply the vicious procedure of the explanation
presupposing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be explained; and moreover no motive can be
assigned for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> originating from itself. And on the hypothesis of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> originating from other things, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that anything
might originate from anything, for all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> alike are _other_ things.
And as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there is no origination there is also no destruction. Hence
the _Nothing_ constitutes Reality: origination, destruction, Being, Non-
being, and so on, are mere illusions (bhrânti). Nor must it be said that
as even an illusion cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a substrate we must assume
something real to serve as a substrate; for in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as an
illusion may arise even when the defect, the abode of the defect, and
the knowing subject are unreal, it also may arise even when the
substrate of the illusion is unreal. Hence the _Nothing_ is the only
reality.--To this the Sûtra replies, 'And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being in
everyway unproved'--the theory of general Nothingness which you hold
cannot stand. Do you hold that everything is being or non-being, or
anything else? On none of these views the Nothingness maintained by you
can be established. For the terms _being_ and _non-being_ and the ideas
expressed by them are generally understood to refer to particular
states of actually _existing_ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> you declare
'everything is nothing,' your declaration is equivalent to the
declaration, 'everything is being,' for your statement also can only
mean that everything that _exists_ is capable of abiding in a certain
condition (which you <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> 'Nothing'). The absolute Nothingness you have
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be established in any way. Moreover, he who tries to
establish the tenet of universal Nothingness can attempt this in so far
only as,--through some means of knowledge, he has come to know
Nothingness, and he must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> acknowledge the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of that means.
For if it were not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that everything is real. The
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of general Nothingness is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> altogether incapable of proof.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'unprovedness in every way.'




31. Not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility in one.

The Bauddhas have been refuted. As now the Jainas also hold the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> originating from atoms and similar views, their theory is
reviewed next.--The Jainas hold that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> comprises souls (jîva),
and non-souls (ajîva), and that there is no Lord. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> further
comprises six substances (dravya), viz. souls (jîva), merit (dharma),
demerit (adharma), bodies (pudgala), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (kâla), and space (âkâsa). The
souls are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> different kinds-bound (in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage),
perfected by Yoga (Yogasiddha), and released (mukta). 'Merit' is that
particular world-pervading substance which is the cause of the motion of
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> moving; 'demerit' is that all-pervading substance which is
the cause of stationariness, 'Body' is that substance which possesses
colour, smell, taste, and touch. It is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, atomic or
compounded of atoms; to the latter kind belong wind, fire, water, earth,
the bodies of living creatures, and so on. 'Time' is a particular atomic
substance which is the cause of the current distinction of past, present,
and future. 'Space' is one, and of infinite extent. From among these
substances those which are not atomic are comprehended under the term
'the five astikâyas (existing bodies)'--the astikâya of souls, the
astikâya of merit, the astikâya of demerit, the astikâya of matter, the
astikâya of space. This term 'astikâya' is applied to substances
occupying several parts of space.--They also <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> another division of
categories which subserves the purpose of Release; distinguishing souls,
non-souls, influx (âsrava), bondage, nijara, samvara, and Release.
_Release_ comprises the means of Release also, viz. perfect knowledge,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> conduct, and so on. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is that which has knowledge, seeing,
pleasure, strength (vîrya) for its qualities. Non-soul is the aggregate
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> enjoyed by the souls. 'Influx' is whatever is instrumental
towards the souls having the fruition of objects, viz. the sense-organs,
and so on.--Bondage is of eight different kinds, comprising the four
ghâtikarman, and the four aghâtikarman. The former term denotes whatever
obstructs the essential qualities of the soul, viz. knowledge,
intuition, strength, pleasure; the latter whatever causes pleasure,
pain, and indifference, which are due to the persistence of the wrong
imagination that makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> identify itself with its body.--'Decay'
means the austerities (tapas), known from the teaching of the Arhat,
which are the means of Release.--Samvara is such deep <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
(Samâdhi) as stops the action of the sense-organs.--Release, finally, is
the manifestation of the Self in its essential nature, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all
afflictions such as passion, and so on.--The atoms which are the causes
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the other compounds, are not, as the Vaiseshikas and others
hold, of four different kinds, but have all the same nature; the
distinctive qualities of earth, and so on, are due to a modification
(parinâma) of the atoms. The Jainas further hold that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> complex
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is of an ambiguous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in so far as being existent and
non-existent, permanent and non-permanent, separate and non-separate. To
prove this they apply their so-called sapta-bhangî-nyâya ('the system of
the seven paralogisms')--'May be, it is'; 'May be, it is not'; 'May be,
it is and is not'; 'May be, it is not predicable'; 'May be, it is and is
not predicable'; 'May be, it is not, and is not predicable'; 'May be, it
is and is not, and is not predicable.' With the help of this they prove
that all things--which they declare to consist of substance (dravya),

they understand the particular states of substances, and as those are of

existence, non-existence, and so on.--With regard to this the Sûtra
remarks that no such proof is possible,'Not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the

contradicting your own theory of everything being of an ambiguous
nature. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> which stand to each other in the relation of mutual

your opinion is that souls abide in numberless places, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> having

that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> passes over into a different state--which process is

34. Nor also is there non-contradiction from paryâya; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
change, and so on.

Nor is the difficulty to be evaded by the assumption of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
assuming a different condition through contraction or dilatation. For
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is subject to change, and all the
imperfections springing from it, viz. non-permanence, and so on, and
hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be superior to non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as jars and the

(resulting) permanency of both; there is no difference.

The final size of the soul, i.e. the size it has in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release,
is enduring since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> does not subsequently <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> into another body;
and both, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release and the size of that
soul, are permanent (nitya). From this it follows that that ultimate
size is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> essential size of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and also belongs to it
previously to Release. Hence there is no difference of sizes, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have the size of its temporary bodies.

theory is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> untenable.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the
impossibility in one.'

So far it has been shown that the doctrines of Kapila, Kanâda, Sugata,
and the Arhat must be disregarded by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> desirous of final beatitude;
for those doctrines are all alike untenable and foreign to the Veda. The
Sûtras now declare that, for the same reasons, the doctrine of Pasupati
also has to be disregarded. The adherents of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> belong to four
different classes--Kâpâlas, Kâlâmukhas, Pâsupatas, and Saivas. All of
them hold fanciful theories of Reality which are in conflict with the
Veda, and invent various means for attaining happiness in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
the next. They maintain the general material cause and the operative
cause to be distinct, and the latter cause to be constituted by Pasupati.
They further hold the wearing of the six so-called 'mudrâ' badges and
the like to be means to accomplish the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> end of man.

using it as a platform for making offerings to the gods, and the like.
'A bracelet made of Rudrâksha-seeds on the arm, matted hair on the head,

With regard to these views the Sûtra says 'of pati, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
inappropriateness.' A 'not' has here to be supplied from Sûtra 32. The
system of Pasupati has to be disregarded because it is inappropriate, i.
e. because the different views and practices referred to are opposed to
one another and in conflict with the Veda. The different practices
enumerated above, the wearing of the six mudrâs and so on, are opposed
to each other; and moreover the theoretical assumptions of those people,
their forms of devotion and their practices, are in conflict with the
Veda. For the Veda declares that Nârâyana who is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is

37. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of rulership.

Those who stand outside the Veda arrive through inference at the
conclusion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is a mere operative cause. This being so, they
must prove the Lord's being the ruler (of the material cause) on the
basis of observation. But it is impossible to prove that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is the

potters. Nor may you have recourse to the hypothesis of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> being

38. If you say, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the organs; we deny this, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>

It may possibly be said that, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the enjoying

allowed 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of enjoyment,' and so on. The body's being ruled by

Pasupati theory cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be accepted.--It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the Sûtra,

causes, and imply an erroneous interchange of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> and lower entities.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'Pasupati.'




40. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the impossibility of origination.

The Sûtras now proceed to refute a further doubt, viz. that the
Pañkarâtra tantra--which sets forth the means of attaining supreme
beatitude, as declared by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> (Bhagavat)--may also be destitute of
authority, in so far, namely, as belonging to the same class as the
tantras of Kapila and others. The above Sûtra raises the doubt.

The theory of the Bhâgavatas is that from Vâsudeva, who is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

theory implies the origination of the individual soul, and this is
contrary to Scripture. For scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to be

many ways,' and it is this birth--consisting in the voluntary assumption
of bodily form, due to tenderness towards its devotees--which the
Bhâgavata system teaches; hence there lies no valid objection to the
authoritativeness of that system. And as Sankarshana. Pradyumna, and
Aniruddha are the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> ruling over the individual souls, internal
organs and organs of egoity, there can be no objection to their being

as to the eternity of the soul, the Pañkarâtra doctrine manifestly
controverts the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the jiva being something

explained under Sû. II, 3, 17. The conclusion, therefore, is that the
Bhâgavata system also denies the origination of the soul, and that hence
the objections raised on this ground against its authoritativeness are
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any force. Another objection is raised by some. Sândilya, they
argue, is said to have promulgated the Pañkarâtra doctrine because he
did not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a sure basis for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> welfare of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the Veda and
its auxiliary disciplines, and this implies that the Pañkarâtra is
opposed to the Veda.--his objection, we reply, springs from nothing else
but the mere unreasoning <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who do not possess the faintest

hosts of arguments which confirm that teaching. When the Veda says,
'Morning after morning those <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> untruth who make the Agnihotra
<span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> before sunrise,' it is understood that the censure there passed
on the <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> before sunrise is really meant to glorify the <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span>
after sunrise. We meet with a similar <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in the 'bhûma-vidyâ' (Ch. Up.
VII, 2). There at the beginning Nârada says, 'I know the Rig-veda, the
Yajur-veda, the Sâma-veda, the Âtharvana as the fourth, the Itihâsa-
purâna as the fifth,' and so on, enumerating all the various branches of
knowledge, and finally summing up 'with all this I know the mantras only,
I do not know the Self.' Now this declaration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
Self not being attainable through any branch of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> except the

this latter knowledge, which is about to be expounded. Or else Nârada's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> refer to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that from the Veda and its auxiliary disciplines

Analogous to
this is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Sândilya's alleged objection to the Veda. That the
Bhâgavata doctrine is meant to facilitate the understanding of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of the Veda which by itself is difficult of comprehension, is declared
in the Paramasamhita,'I have read the Vedas at length, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with all

Brahman, this is supremely beneficial. Fully agreeing with the Rik, the
Yajus, the Sâman, and the Atharvân-giras, this doctrine will be truly
authoritative.' The terms Sânkhya and Yoga here denote the concentrated
application of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and of works. As has been said, 'By the

part of the Yogins.' And in the Bhîshmaparvan we read, 'By Brahmanas,
Kshattriyas, Vaisyas and Sûdras, Mâdhava is to be honoured, served and
worshipped--he who was proclaimed by Sankarshana in agreement with the
Sâtvata law.'--How then could these utterances of Bâdarâyana, the
foremost among all those who understand the teaching of the Veda, be
reconciled with the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that in the Sûtras he maintains the non-
authoritativeness of the Sâtvata doctrine, the purport of which is to
teach the worship of, and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on, Vâsudeva, who is none other
than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> known from the Vedânta-texts?

But other passages in the Mahâbhârata, such as 'There is the Sânkhya,
the Yoga, the Pañkarâtra, the Vedas, and the Pasupata doctrine; do all
these rest on one and the same basis, or on different ones?' and so on,
declare that the Sânkhya and other doctrines also are worthy of regard,
while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in the Sârîraka Sûtras those very same doctrines are formally

the Bhâgavata doctrine?--Not so, we reply. In the Mahâbhârata also
Bâdarayana applies to the Sânkhya and other doctrines the same style of
reasoning as in the Sûtras. The question, asked in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> quoted,
means 'Do the Sânkhya, the Yoga, the Pasupata, and the Pañkarâtra <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth one and the same reality, or different ones? If the former, what
is that reality? If the latter, they convey contradictory doctrines, and,
as reality is not something which may be optionally assumed to be either
such or such, one of those doctrines only can be acknowledged as
authoritative, and the question then arises which is to be so
acknowledged?'--The answer to the question is given in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
beginning, 'Know, O royal Sage, all those different views. The
promulgator of the Sânkhya is Kapila,' &c. Here the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> origin of the
Sânkhya, Yoga, and Pâsupata is established on the ground of their having
been produced by Kapila, Hiranyagarbha, and Pasupati. Next the clause
'Aparântatamas is said to be the teacher of the Vedas' intimates the non-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> character of the Vedas; and finally the clause 'Of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
Pañkarâtra, Nârâyana himself is the promulgator' declares that Nârâyana
himself revealed the Pañkarâtra doctrine. The connected purport of these
different clauses is as follows. As the systems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> origin <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
forth doctrines mutually contradictory, and, moreover, teach what is in
conflict with the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> known from the Veda--which, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its
non-human character, is raised above all suspicion of error and other
imperfections--they cannot be accepted as authoritative with regard to
anything not depending on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> action and choice. Now the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> to be
known from the Veda is Nârâyana, who is none other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman. It hence follows that the entities <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in those different

be viewed as real only in so far as Nârâyana, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman,
as known from the Vedânta-texts, constitutes their Self. This the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
directly declares in the passage, 'In all those doctrines it is seen, in
accordance with tradition and reasoning, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> Narayawa is the
only basis.' This means--'To him who considers the entities <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in
those systems with the help of argumentation, it is evident that
Nârâyana alone is the basis of all those entities.' In other words, as
the entities <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in those systems are not Brahman, any one who
remembers the teaching of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'all this indeed is Brahman,'
'Nârâyana is all,' which declare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be the Self of all, comes to
the conclusion that Nârâyana alone is the basis of those entities. As
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is settled that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, as known from the Vedânta-
texts, or Nârâyana, himself is the promulgator of the entire Pañkarâtra,
and that this system teaches the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Nârâyana and the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
of worshipping him, none can disestablish the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that in the
Pañkarâtra all the other doctrines are comprised. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> the
Mahâbhârata says, 'Thus the Sânkhya-yoga and the Veda and the Âranyaka,
being members of one another, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Pañkarâtra,' i.e. the
Sânkhya, the Yoga, the Vedas, and the Âranyakas, which are members of
one another because they are one in so far as aiming at setting forth
one Truth, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Pañkarâtra.--The Sânkhya explains the
twenty-five principles, the Yoga teaches certain practices and means of
mental concentration, and the Âranyakas teach that all the subordinate
principles have their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Self in Brahman, that the mental
concentration enjoined in the Yoga is a mode of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Brahman,
and that the rites and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> which are <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the Veda are means
to win the favour of Brahman--thus giving instruction as to Brahman's
nature. Now all these elements, in their inward connexion, are clearly
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the Pañkarâtra by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, i.e. Nârâyana,
himself. The Sârîraka Sâstra (i.e. the Vedânta) does not disprove the
principles assumed by the Sânkhyas, but merely the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of their not
having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for their Self; and similarly in its criticism on the
Yoga and Pâsupata systems, it merely refutes the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> being
a mere instrumental cause, the erroneous assumptions as to the relative
position of <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> and lower entities, and certain practices not
warranted by the Veda; but it does not reject the Yoga itself, nor again
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> Pâsupati. Hence Smriti says,' The Sânkhya, the Yoga, the
Pañkarâtra, the Vedas, and the Psupata doctrine--all these having their
proof in the Self may not be destroyed by arguments.' The essential
points in all these doctrines are to be adopted, not to be rejected
absolutely as the teaching of Jina. or Sugata is to be rejected. For, as
said in the Smriti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted above, in all those doctrines it is seen,
according to tradition and reasoning, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> Nârâyana is the only
basis.'--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the impossibility of
origination.'




<span class="t7 hoverable">THIRD</span> PÂDA.

1. Not Ether; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of scriptural statement.

We have demonstrated that the Sânkhya-system and other systems standing
outside the Veda are untenable since they rest on fallacious reasoning
and are self-contradictory. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to prove that our own <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is
altogether <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all objections of this kind, we shall now explain
in detail the mode in which this world, with all its sentient and non-
sentient beings, is produced by Brahman, whom we hold to be the general
creator.

The first doubt here presenting itself is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Ether be something
produced or not.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains that it is not produced,
since there is no scriptural statement to that effect. A scriptural
statement may be expected with regard to what is possible; but what is
impossible--as e.g. the origination of a sky-flower or of Ether--cannot
possibly be taught by Scripture. For the origination of Ether, which is
not made up of parts and is all pervasive, cannot be imagined in any way.
For this very reason, i.e. the impossibility of the thing, the Chandogya,
in its <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of creation, mentions the origination of fire, water, &c.
only (but not of Ether)--'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,'
'It sent forth fire,' and so on. When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the Taittirîya, the
Atharvana, and other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> tell us that Ether did originate--'From that
Self sprang Ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'From him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> breath, mind,
and all organs of sense, Ether, air, light, water,' &c. (Mu. Up. II, 1,
4)--such statements are contrary to sense, and hence refute themselves.--
To this the Sûtra replies.




2. But there is.

But there is origination of Ether. For Scripture, which is concerned
with matters transcending <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> perception, is able to establish the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> even of the origination of Ether, although this be not proved by
other means of knowledge. And in a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> known from Scripture a
contradictory inference, such as that Ether cannot originate because it
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts, is not of sufficient force. That the non-
originatedness of the Self also does not rest on its being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> parts
will be shown further on.--Here the Pûrvapakshin raises an objection.




3. It has a secondary sense, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of impossibility and of the text.

It is reasonable to assume that in passages such as 'From that Self
there sprang Ether.' the origination of Ether is not to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in its
literal sense; for according to the Chândogya-text 'it sent forth fire.'
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> engaged in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> first produces fire, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having
the first place, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> cannot possibly mean to say that Ether also
was produced. Moreover, there is another text, viz.'Vâyu and antariksha
(i.e. Ether), this is the Immortal,' according to which Ether is
immortal, i. e. non-produced.--But how can one and the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> viz. it
'sprang' (i.e. originated), be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in a metaphorical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> with
reference to Ether, and in its literal <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> with reference to fire, and
so on?--To this the next Sûtra replies.




4. There may be (a double sense) of the one (word), as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Brahman.'

Since in the clause 'from that Self there sprang Brahman,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
'sprang' cannot be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in its literal senbe, it may be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> there in a
secondary sense; while the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> as connected with the subsequent
clauses 'from Vâyu Agni,' &c., may have its primary sense. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
analogous to the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in Mu. Up. I, 1. There in the
clause 'From him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> that Brahman, name, form, and matter' (9). the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> _Brahman_ is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in a secondary sense, i.e. denotes the Pradhâna;
while in the same chapter, in the clause 'Brahman swells by means of
brooding' (8), the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> denotes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in its primary sense. It is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> indeed that in this latter <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Brahman' occurs twice;
while in the Taitt. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'sambhûta' occurs once only, and has
to be carried over from the first clause into the subsequent ones; but
this makes no difference, for, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such carrying over of a
word, no less than in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of actual repetition, the general
denotation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is repeated.--The next Sûtra refutes this
objection.




5. The non-abandonment of the promissory statement (results) from non-
difference.

It is not appropriate to assume, from deference to the Chândogya-text, a
secondary <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> for those other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also which declare Ether to have
originated. For the Chândogyaitself virtually admits the origination of
Ether; in so far, namely, as the clause 'that by which the non-heard is
heard,' &c., declares that through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> everything
is known. This declaration is not abandoned, i.e. is adhered to, only if
the Ether also is an effect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> non-different from it.




6. (As follows also) from (other) texts.

That Ether is an originated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> follows from other clauses also in the
Chândogya: 'Being only this was in the beginning, one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a second'
affirms the oneness of everything before creation, and 'In that all this
has its Self implies that everything is an effect of, and hence non-
different from, Brahman.--Nor does the statement as to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of
fire, 'it sent forth fire,' exclude the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of Ether. For the first
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> which there is assigned to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> rests only thereon that no mention
is made of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of Ether, and this has no force to negative the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of Ether as positively stated in other texts.




7. But the division (origination) extends over all effects; as in
ordinary life.

The 'but' has the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'and.' As the clause 'In that all this has
its Self' and similar ones directly <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that Ether also is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
of Brahman, the division, i.e. the origination of Ether from Brahman, is
implicitly declared thereby. As in ordinary life. When in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
somebody has said 'all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of Devadatta,' it is known
that any particulars which may afterwards be given about the descent of
some of them are meant to apply to all.--In accordance with this our
conclusion we interpret the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Air and Ether, this is the Immortal,'
as asserting only that air and Ether continue to exist for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time,
as the Devas do.




8. Hereby air is explained.

The same argumentation explains the origination of air also. That a
special Sûtra is devoted to the origination of air--instead of disposing
in one Sûtra of Ether and air--is for the sake of Sûtra 10, which states
that 'hence (i.e. from air) there originated fire.'




9. But there is non-origination of that which is (only); on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
impossibility.

The 'but' has an affirmative sense. There is non-origination of that
which is, i.e. of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only; of whatever is different from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
non-origination cannot possibly be established. This means--the
origination of Ether and air has been proved only in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to illustrate
a general truth. Only that which _is_, i.e. Brahman, which is the
general cause, cannot originate. Whatever is other than Brahman, i. e.
the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> comprising the Unevolved, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> principle (mahat),
ahankâra, the tanmâtras, the sense-organs, the Ether, the air, and so on,
cannot possibly be shown to be non-originated, since its being an effect
is proved by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declaring that everything is known through one
thing, and in other ways.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the Ether.'




10. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> (is produced) thence, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Scripture declares.

It has been stated that everything different from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the effect
of Brahman. The doubt now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the more remote effects of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> originate, each of them, only from that substance which is their
immediately antecedent cause or from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of that
substance.--The decision is that they originate from those substances
only; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'from air fire' directly states the origination of

that the section in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> occurs has for its subject-matter the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the elements; as everything eatable is a product of the
earth, the term denoting the effect is there applied to denote the cause.
In the same chapter, where the colour of the elements is mentioned ('The
red colour of a flame is the colour of fire, the white one that of water,
the black one that of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> '), the collocation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> clearly shows
that 'food' means something of the same kind as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and water, viz. the
elements of earth. And there are other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also which treat of the
same topic and declare the origination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> from water, cp. Taitt.
Up. II, 1, 'from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> sprang water, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> earth.' All this proves
that the term 'food' denotes earth, and that hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> originates from

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> and the other substances, the origination of which has been
detailed, are mentioned merely as instances, and it must be understood
that also other entities, such as the 'Mahat,' and so on, originate only
from the immediately preceding cause, in agreement with scriptural
statements. And <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'From him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> breath, mind, and all

food' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'From that Self there sprang ether' (Taitt. Up.
II, 1, 1); 'It (i.e. that which is) sent forth fire' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3)--
(which seems to teach the direct origination from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of the

of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being their mediate cause also.--This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the
next Sûtra disposes of.




14. But he; from the inferential mark supplied by their reflection.

The 'but' indicates the setting aside of the primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> raised. Of
all effected things, the _Mahat_, and so on, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> himself,
in so far as embodied in the immediately preceding substance, is the
direct cause.--How is this known?--'From the inferential mark supplied
by the reflection of them.' By 'reflection' the Sûtra means the resolve
expressed in the recurring phrase, 'May I be many'; 'That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> thought,

4). As these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare that there was <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a

we conclude that also the Mahat, the ahankâra, the Ether, and so on,
accomplish the sending forth of their respective effects only after
similar thought, and such <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> can belong only to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

embodied in all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and constitutes their Self, is directly stated in
the antaryâmin-brâhmana, 'He who abiding in the earth; abiding in water;
abiding in fire,' &c. &c. (Bri. Up. III, 7, 3 ff.); and likewise in the
Subâla-Up, 'Whose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the earth,' &c. &c., up to 'Whose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the
Unevolved.' The Pûrvapakshin had maintained that the creation, from
Brahman, of breath, and so on, which is declared in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'From
him are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> breath, mind,' &c., may be understood as a mediate creation.
This point is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up by the next Sûtra.




15. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of succession (which is stated) in reverse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> (of

thence (i.e. from Brahman).

The 'but' has an asseverative sense. The direct origination from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

Pûrvapakshin is stated in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> the reverse of the (true) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
origination according to which the Unevolved, the Mahat, the ahankâra,
Ether, and so on, succeed each other--is possible only on the
supposition of the origination of each effect being really from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

16. If it be said that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (which are mentioned) between

an inferential mark of this; we say, not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-
difference.

'Knowledge' in the Sûtra denotes the means of knowledge, i.e. the sense-
organs.--An objection is raised against the conclusion arrived at under
the preceding Sûtra. We cannot, the opponent says, admit the conclusion
that the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> from the Mundka Up. 'from him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> breath, mind,' &c.,
declares the immediate origination from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of all things, and that
hence the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> confirms the view, first suggested by the inferential
mark of 'thought' (see above, Sû. 14), that everything springs from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> direct. For the purport of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
of succession, and we hence conclude that all the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> mentioned were
successively created. In the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> half of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> we recognise the

conclude that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and mind--which are mentioned between breath on
the one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> and the elements on the other--must be viewed as <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> in
that order. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> confirms the direct origination

and the scries of elements beginning with ether; and the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the

Brahman, not to teach the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of succession in which they are produced.
It moreover cannot have the purport of teaching a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of

by other scriptural passages; such as the one beginning 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is
merged in water,' and ending 'darkness becomes one.' We hence hold to
the conclusion that all effects originate from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only, in so far
as embodied in the Unevolved, and so on, and that the terms 'fire' and

the next Sûtra replies.




17. But that which abides in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> movable and immovable, i.e. the
terms denoting those things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary
denotative power, viz. with regard to Brahman); since (their denotative
power) is effected by the being of that (i.e. Brahman).

The 'but' sets aside the objection raised. (The primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> here is
as follows.) As Brahman, which has all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> for its modes, is not the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of Perception and the other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which give rise to
the apprehension of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only which are Brahman's modes, and as
hence, previously to the study of the Vedânta-texts, the idea of that to
which the modes belong (i.e. of Brahman) does not arise, and as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> finally denoting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> depends on the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
of the idea of that to which the modes belong (i. e. Brahman); all the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> are <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in worldly language only separately to denote
special things. In other words, as the terms 'fire' and so on have
denotative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> with regard to particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only, their denotative

the Sûtra disposes by saying 'that which abides in the moving and the
non-moving,' &c. The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is--the terms which abide in, i.e. are

denote those things, possess with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> a denotative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

Because the denotative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> is dependent
on the being of Brahman. For this we know from the scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
which tells how names and forms were evolved by Brahman.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'fire.'




18. Not the Self, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement, and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the eternity (which results) from them.

The Sûtras so far have stated that this entire world, from Ether
downwards, originates from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. It now becomes a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
for discussion <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also originates in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> or not.--It does so originate, the Pûrvapakshin maintains. For on
this assumption only the scriptural statement as to the cognition of all
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> through the cognition of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> holds good, and moreover
Scripture declares that before <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> everything was one. Moreover,
there are <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> directly stating that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also was produced in the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as Ether and other <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> things.

'Prajâpati sent forth all creatures'; 'All these creatures have their
root in the True, they abide in the True, they rest on the True' (Ch. Up.
VI, 8, 6); 'From whence these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are produced' (Taitt. Up. III, 1,
1). As these passages declare the origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> inclusive of
sentient beings, we conclude that the souls also originate. Nor must
this be objected to on the ground than from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
eternal, and the other <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'That <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> them' teach the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman, it follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also is
eternal. For if we reasoned in this style we should have to admit also
that the Ether and the other elements are eternal, since <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as
'in that all this has its Self' and 'all this indeed is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
'intimate them also to be of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman. Hence the individual
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also originates no less than Ether and the rest.--To this the Sûtra
replies, 'Not the Self, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement.' The Self is
not produced, since certain <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> directly deny its origination; cp.
'the intelligent one is not <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> nor does he die' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18);
'There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unborn ones, one intelligent and strong, the other non-
intelligent and weak' (Svet. Up. I, 9). And the eternity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
learned from the same texts, cp. 'There is one <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> thinker,' &c. (Ka.
Up. II,5, 13); 'Unborn, eternal, everlasting is that ancient one; he is
not killed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is killed' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18).--For these
reasons the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not produced.

But how then about the declaration that through the cognition of one
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> everything is known?-There is no difficulty here, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
also is an effect, and since effect and cause are non-different.--But
this implies that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is an originated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> just like Ether and so
on!--Not so, we reply. By a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> being an effect we mean its being due
to a substance passing over into some other state; and from this point
of <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also is an effect. There is, however, the difference,
that the 'other condition' which is represented by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is of a
different kind from that which constitutes non-sentient things, such as
Ether and so on. The 'otherness' on which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> depends consists in
the contraction and expansion of intelligence; while the change on which
the origination of Ether and so on depends is a change of essential
nature. And change of the latter kind is what we deny of the soul. We
have shown that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> entities of distinct nature, viz.
objects of fruition, enjoying subjects, and a Ruler; that origination
and so on which are characteristic of the objects do not belong to the
subjects, and that the latter are eternal; that the characteristic
qualities of the objects and likewise those of the subjects--viz.
liability to pain and suffering--do not belong to the Ruler; that the
latter is eternal, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all imperfections, omniscient, immediately
realising all his purposes, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the lords of the organs, the

their states constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> while he constitutes their

While <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> has for its modes (prakâra) the sentient and
non-sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in which it ever is embodied, during certain periods
those <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> abide in so subtle a condition as to be incapable of
receiving designations different from that of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
then is said to be in its causal state. When, on the other hand, its

have separate, distinct names and forms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is said to be in its

into the effected state, the aggregate of non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which in
the causal <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> were destitute of name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> undergoes an essential
change of nature--implying the possession of distinct names and so on--
so as to become fit to constitute objects of fruition for sentient
beings; the change, on the other hand, which the sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> (the
souls) undergo on that occasion is nothing more than a certain expansion
of <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> (or consciousness), capacitating them to experience the
different rewards or punishments for their previous deeds. The ruling
element of the world, i.e. the Lord, finally, who has the sentient and
non-sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> for his modes, undergoes a change in so far as he is,
at alternating periods, embodied in all those <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in their
alternating states. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> modes, and he to whom the modes belong, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
undergo a common change in so far as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of all of them the
causal condition passes over into a different condition.

It is with reference to this change undergone by one substance in
passing over into a different <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that the Chandogya says that through
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> everything is known, and illustrates this by
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the lump of clay (knowing which we know all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> made of

4, 25); 'the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> thinker,' &c. (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13); such <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> have
for their subject the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Lord.--All this also explains how Brahman,
which is at all times differentiated by the sentient and non-sentient
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> that constitute its body, can be said to be one only previous to
creation; the statement is possible because at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
differentiation of names and forms did not exist. That that which makes
the difference between plurality and unity is the presence or absence of
differentiation through names and forms, is distinctly declared in the
text, 'Now all this was undifferentiated. It became differentiated by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> and name' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 7).--Those also who hold that the

a real limiting adjunct (upâdhi); and those who hold that Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

enjoying subjects, objects of enjoyment, and supreme Ruler; can all of
them explain the unity which Scripture predicates of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the
pralaya state, only on the basis of the absence of differentiation by
names and forms; for according to them also (there is no absolute unity
at any time, but) either the potentiality of Nescience, or the
potentiality of the limiting adjunct, or the potentialities of enjoying
subjects, objects of enjoyment, and supreme Ruler persist in the pralaya
condition also. And, moreover, it is proved by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras, II, 1, 33;
35, that the distinction of the several individual souls and the stream

There is, however, the following difference between those several views.
The first-mentioned <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> implies that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself is under the
illusive influence of beginningless Avidyâ. According to the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> view,
the effect of the real and beginningless limiting adjunct is that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself is in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage; for there is no other entity
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the adjunct. According to the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> view, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself
assumes different forms, and itself experiences the various unpleasant
consequences of deeds. Nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> it avail to say that that part of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the Ruler is not an experiencing subject; for as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is all-knowing it recognises the enjoying subject as non-
different from itself, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is itself an enjoying subject.--
According to our view, on the other hand, Brahman, which has for its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> all sentient and non-sentient beings, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in their subtle or
their gross state, is always--in its effected as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in its causal
condition <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shadow of imperfection, and a limitless ocean as
it were of all exalted qualities. All imperfections, and suffering, and
all change belong not to Brahman, but only to the sentient and non-
sentient <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> which are its modes. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> removes all difficulties.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the Self.'




19. For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> (the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is) a knower.

It has been shown that, different therein from Ether and the rest, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not produced. This leads to the consideration of the soul's
essential nature. Is that essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> constituted by mere
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> as Sugata and Kapila hold; or is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as Kanâda thinks,
essentially non-intelligent, comparable to a stone, while <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
is merely an adventitious quality of it; or is it essentially a knowing
subject?--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is mere intelligence, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; for
the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that Scripture declares it to be so. For in the antaryâmin-
brâhmana the clause which in the Mâdhyandina-text runs as follows, 'he
who abides in the Self,' is in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Kânvas represented by the
clause 'he who abides in knowledge.' Similarly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'knowledge
performs the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and all sacred acts' (Taitt. Up. II, 5, I) shows
that it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the active Self.
And Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> convey the same view, as e.g. 'it in reality is of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of absolutely spotless intelligence.' A <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Pûrvapakshin
denies the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of this view. If, he says, we assume that the Self's
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> consists either in mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or in its being a
knowing subject, it follows that as the Self is omnipresent there must
be <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> at all places and at all times. On that doctrine we,
further, could not <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the instruments of cognition
(i.e. the sense-organs, &c.); nor for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in the states of
deep sleep, swoon and so on, the Self although present is not observed
to be conscious, while on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is seen to arise
as soon as the conditions of the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> are realised. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
conclude that neither <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> or consciousness, nor being a knowing
agent, constitutes the essence of the soul, but that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is a
mere adventitious or occasional attribute. And the omnipresence of the
Self must needs be admitted since its effects are perceived everywhere.
Nor is there any valid <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for holding that the Self moves to any
place; for as it is assumed to be present everywhere the actual
accomplishment of effects (at certain places only) may be attributed to
the moving of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only.--Scripture also directly declares that in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep there is no consciousness, 'I do not indeed at
the present moment know myself, so as to be able to say "that am I," nor
do I know those beings.' Similarly Scripture declares the absence of
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of final release, 'when he has departed there
is no consciousness' (Bri. Up. II, 4, 12); where the Self is spoken of
as having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for its essential nature, the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> only is that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> constitutes its specific quality, and the expression is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> not to be urged in its literal sense.

Against all this the Sûtra declares 'for this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> a knower.'
This Self is essentially a knower, a knowing subject; not either mere
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or of non-sentient nature.--Why?--'For this very reason,' i.e.
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture itself. 'For this reason' refers back to the 'on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture' in the preceding Sûtra. For in the Chândogya,
where the condition of the released and the non-released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
described, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says 'He who knows, let me smell this, he is the

not remembering the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into which he was born' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 4-5;
1, 5; 12, 3). And elsewhere 'The seer does not see death' (Ch. Up. VII,
26, 2). Similarly we read in the Vâjasaneyaka, in reply to the question
'Who is that Self?'--'He who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, surrounded by the
Prânas, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> of light, consisting of knowledge' (Bri. Up. IV, 3,
7); 'By what should one know the knower?' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'That
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> knows.' And 'for he is the knower, the hearer, the smeller, the
taster, the perceiver, the thinker, the agent--he the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> Self

9; VI, 5). To the objection that if being a cognising subject
constituted the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that as the

The Self is not omnipresent, but on the contrary, of atomic size (anu).--
How is this known?--Since Scripture says that it passes out, goes and
returns. Its passing out is described in the following <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'by that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> this Self departs, either through the eye, or through the skull,
or through other parts of the body' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 2). Its going in
the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'all those who <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away out of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> go to the
moon,' and its returning in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he comes again
into this world, for action.' All this going, and so on, cannot be
reconciled with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> being present everywhere.




21. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> (being effected) through the Self.

The 'and' has affirming power. The 'passing out' might somehow be
reconciled with a non-moving Self (such as the omnipresent Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be) if it were <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the Self separating from the body;
but for the going and returning no analogous explanation is possible.
They, therefore, must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as effected by the Self itself (which,
then, cannot be omnipresent and non-moving).




22. If it be said that (the soul) is not atomic, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
scriptural statement of (what is) not that; we say no, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
other one being the topic.

The <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'He who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, surrounded by the Prânas, the
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> consisting of knowledge' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 7) introduces as the
topic of discussion the personal Self, and further on in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> we read 'the unborn Self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> one' (IV, 4, 22). The
personal Self, being expressly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> _great_, cannot, therefore, be
atomic!--Not so, we reply. 'Since the other one is the topic.' In the
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted that Self which is other than the personal Self--i.e.
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self (prâjña) constitutes the topic. In the beginning of the
chapter, indeed, the individual Self is introduced, but later on,
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> quoted, the instruction begins to concern itself
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, 'he by whom there is known the Self of
intelligence' (pratibuddha âtmâ; IV, 4, 13). It is this latter Self
which, in 22 is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> _great_, not the individual Self.




23. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the very word, and of measure.

Scripture directly applies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'anu' to the individual Self, 'By
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is to be known that atomic Self into which Breath has entered
fivefold' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 9).--By the term 'unmâna' in the Sûtra we
have to understand measurement by selection of comparative instances.
Scripture declares the minuteness of the individual Self by reference to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are like atoms in size, 'The individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is to be known
as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred
times, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is to be infinite' (Svet. Up. V, 9); 'that lower one
is seen of the measure of the point of a goad' (V, 8). For these reasons
also the individual Self must be viewed as atomic.--But this conflicts
with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that sensation extends over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body!--This
objection the next Sûtra refutes by means of an analogous instance.




24. There is no contradiction, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sandal-ointment.

As a drop of sandal-ointment, although applied to one spot of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
only, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> produces a refreshing sensation extending over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the Self also, although dwelling in one part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only, is
conscious of sensations taking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in any part of the body.




25. Should it be said (that this is not so) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of specialisation
of abode; we say no, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the acknowledgment (of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the
Self), viz. in the heart.

There is a difference. The drop of ointment can produce its effect as at
any rate it is in contact with a definite part of the body. But we know
of no such part in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the soul!--Not so, we reply. Scripture
informs us that the Self abides in a definite part of the body, viz. the
heart. 'For that Self is in the heart, there are a hundred and one veins.'
And in reply to the question 'What is that Self?' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> has 'He who
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, surrounded by the Prânas, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> of light,
consisting of knowledge' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 7).--The parallel <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the sandal-ointment is referred to in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to point out that the Self
abides in some particular part of the body; while the ointment is not
bound to any special place.--In the next Sûtra the Sûtrakâra proceeds to
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> how, according to his own view, the Self, although abiding in one
spot only, gives rise to effects extending over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> body.




26. Or on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its quality as light.

The 'or' is meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> previously stated. The Self
extends through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by means of its quality, viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
or consciousness. 'As light.' As the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> abiding in one
place--such as gems, the sun, and so on--is seen to extend to many
places, so the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Self dwelling in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> pervades
the entire body. That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the knowing subject may extend
beyond its substrate, as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of a luminous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does, we have
already explained under the first Sûtra.--But it has been said that the
Self is _mere_ knowledge; how then can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> be said to be a quality--
which is something different from the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a thing?--This
the next Sûtra explains.




27. There is distinction as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of smell; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Scripture
declares.

Just as smell, which is perceived as a quality of earth, is distinct
from earth; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of which we are conscious as the quality of a
knowing subject--which relation expresses itself in judgments such as 'I
know'--is different from the knowing subject. Scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also
prove this relation, as e.g. 'This <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> knows.'




28. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the separate statement.

Scripture even states quite directly that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is something
distinct from the knowing subject, viz. in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'For there is not
known any intermission of the knowing of the knower' (Bri. Up. IV, 3,
30).--It has been said that in passages such as 'he who abiding in
knowledge' (Bri. Up. III, 7, 22); 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice'
(Taitt. Up. II, 5, 1); 'having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for its nature, absolutely <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span>
from stain,'Scripture speaks of the Self as being mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (not a
knower). This point the next Sûtra elucidates.




29. But (the Self) is designated as that because it has that quality
(viz. knowledge) for its essential quality; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
intelligent (prâjña) Self.

The 'but' discards the objection. Because that quality, viz. the quality
of knowledge, is the essential quality, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the Self is, in the
passages quoted, designated as knowledge. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> constitutes the
essential quality of the Self. Similarly, the intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
is occasionally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'Bliss,' because bliss is its essential quality.
Compare 'If that bliss existed not in the ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 7, 1);
'He perceived that bliss is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1). That bliss
is the essential attribute of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is proved by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'That
is one bliss of Brahman'; 'He who knows the bliss of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is afraid
of nothing' (Taitt. Up. II, 4, 1).--Or else the analogous <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> to which
the Sûtra refers may be that of the intelligent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being designated
by the term 'knowledge,' in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Truth, knowledge, the
Infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1). That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is the essential
quality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is known from passages such as 'together with the
intelligent Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'He who is all-knowing' (Mu.
Up. I, 1, 9).




30. And there is no objection, since (the quality of knowledge) exists
wherever the Self is; this being observed.

Since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is an attribute which is met with wherever a Self is,
there is no objection to the Self being designated by that attribute.
Similarly we observe that special kinds of cows, as e.g. hornless ones,
are designated by the term 'cow,' since the quality of possessing the
generic character of cows is met with everywhere in connexion with the
essential character of such animals with mutilated horns; since in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that quality contributes to define their essential character. The 'and'
of the Sûtra is meant to suggest a further argument, viz. that to apply
to the Self the term 'knowledge' is suitable for that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also that
like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> the Self is self-illuminated. The objection that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> cannot be an attribute inseparably connected
with the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self as there is no <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> in
deep sleep and similar states is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up in the next Sûtra.




31. Since there may be manifestation of that which exists; as in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of virile <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and so on.

The 'but' is meant to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the raised objection aside. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> may be
that while <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> is present also in deep sleep, and so on, it is
manifested in the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> only; whence there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no objection
to viewing <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> as an essential attribute of the Self. 'As in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of virile <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and the like.' Special substances such as the
virile element are indeed present in the male child already, but then
are not manifest, while later on they manifest themselves with advancing
youth; but all the same the possession of those substances is essential
to the male being, not merely adventitious. For to be made up of seven
elementary substances (viz. blood, humour, flesh, fat, marrow, bone, and
semen) is an essential, property of the body. That even in deep sleep
and similar states the 'I' shines forth we have explained above.
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is always there, but only in the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> and in
dreams it is observed to relate itself to objects. And that to be a
subject of cognition, and so on, are essential attributes of the Self,
we have also proved before. The conclusion, therefore, is that to be a
knowing subject is the essential character of the Self. And that Self is
of atomic size. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'when he has departed there is no
consciousness' (samjñâ; Bri. Up. II, 4, 12) does not declare that the
released Self has no consciousness; but only that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of that
Self there is absent that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (experience) of birth, death, and so
on, which in the Samsâra <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is caused by the connexion of the Self
with the elements--as described in the preceding passage, 'that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
being having risen from out these elements again perishes after them.'
For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> as to the absence of samjñâ after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> must be interpreted
in harmony with other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> describing the condition of the released
soul, such as 'the seeing one does not see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> nor illness nor pain;
the seeing one sees everything and obtains everything everywhere' (Ch.
Up. VII, 25, 2); 'not remembering that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into which he was born--
seeing these pleasures with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> he rejoices' (VIII, 12, 3; 5).

The Sûtras now proceed to refute the doctrine of the Self being (not a
knower) but mere knowledge, and being omnipresent.




32. There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result permanent <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or non-consciousness, or
else limitative restriction to either.

On the other view, i.e. on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the Self being omnipresent and
mere knowledge, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow either that <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and also non-

that there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be definite permanent restriction to either of the two,
i.e. either permanent <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> or permanent non-consciousness.--If
the omnipresent Self, consisting of mere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only, were the cause
of all that actual <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and non-consciousness on the part of
Selfs which takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the world, it might be conceived either as
the cause of both--i.e. <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and non-consciousness--and this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mean that there is everywhere and at all times simultaneous
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and non-consciousness. If, on the other hand, it were the
cause of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never and nowhere be
unconsciousness of anything; and if it were the cause of non-
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> only, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never and nowhere be <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of
anything. On our view, on the other hand, the actually perceived
distribution of <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> and non-consciousness explains itself,
since we hold the Self to abide <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> bodies only, so that naturally
<span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there only, not anywhere else.--The view,
finally (held by the Vaiseshikas), of the <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Self
depending on its organs (mind, senses, &c.; while the omnipresent Self
is, apart from those organs, non-sentient, jada), results in the same
difficulties as the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> criticised above; for as all the Selfs are
omnipresent they are in permanent conjunction with all organs; and
moreover it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that the adrishtas (due to the actions of the
different bodies) could not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be held apart (but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cling to all
Selfs, each of which is in contact with all bodies).

Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the _knower_.'




33. (The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is) an agent, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture (thus) having a
purport.

It has been shown that the individual Self is a knowing subject and
atomic. Now the question arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> that Self is an agent or, being
itself non-active, erroneously ascribes to itself the activity of the
non-sentient gunas. The primâ facie answer is that the individual Self
is not an agent, since the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> concerned with the Self declare
that the Self does not act, while the gunas do act. Thus, e.g. in the
Kathavallî, where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> at first denies of the individual Self all
the attributes of Prakriti, such as being born, ageing and dying ('he is
not born, he does not die'), and then also denies that the Self is the
agent in acts such as killing and the like, 'If the slayer thinks that
he slays, if the slain thinks that he is slain, they both do not
understand; for this one does not slay, nor is that one slain' (I, 2,
19). This means--if one thinks the Self to be the slayer one does not
know the Self. And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> himself teaches that non-agency is the
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual soul, and that it is mere delusion on
the Self's part to ascribe to itself agency. 'By the attributes (guna)
of Prakriti, actions are wrought all round.' He who is deluded by self-
conceit thinks 'I am the agent'; 'when the seer beholds no other agent
than the gunas'; 'Prakriti is said to be the cause of all agency of
causes and effects, whilst the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is the cause of all enjoyment of
pleasure and pain' (Bha. Gî. III, 27; XIV, 19; XIII, 20).--The soul,
therefore, is an enjoyer only, while all agency belongs to Prakriti--To
this the Sûtra replies, 'an agent, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Scripture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having a
meaning.' The Self only is an agent, not the gunas, because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> only
Scripture has a meaning. For the scriptural injunctions, such as 'he who
desires the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to sacrifice,' 'He who desires Release is
to meditate on Brahman,' and similar ones, enjoin action on him only who
will enjoy the fruit of the action--whether the heavenly world, or
Release, or anything else. If a non-sentient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> were the agent, the
injunction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be addressed to another being (viz. to an
intelligent being--to which it actually is addressed). The term 'sâstra'
(scriptural injunction) moreover comes from sâs, to command, and
commanding means impelling to action. But scriptural injunctions impel
to action through giving rise to a certain conception (in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of
the being addressed), and the non-sentient Pradhâna cannot be made to
conceive anything. Scripture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> has a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only, if we admit
that none but the intelligent enjoyer of the fruit of the action is at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the agent. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the Pûrva Mimamsa declares 'the fruit of
the injunction belongs to the agent' (III, 7, 18). The Pûrvapakshin had
contended that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'if the slayer thinks, &c.,' proves the Self not
to be the agent in the action of slaying; but what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> really means
is only that the Self as being <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> cannot be killed. The text, from
Smriti, which was alleged as proving that the gunas only possess active
power, refers to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in all activities lying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere
of the samsara, the activity of the Self is due not to its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
but to its contact with the different gunas. The activity of the gunas,
therefore, must be viewed not as permanent, but occasional only. In the
same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> Smriti says 'the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> is the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> with the
guwas, in its births, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> wombs' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 21).
Similarly it is said there (XVIII, 16) that 'he who through an untrained

from a previous <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> that the activity of the Self depends on five
factors (as enumerated in sl. 16), he who views the isolated Self to be
an agent has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> insight.




34. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of taking and the declaration as to its moving about.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> beginning 'And as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> king,' &c., declares that 'the Self
taking the pranas moves about in its own body, according to its
pleasure' (Bri. Up. II, 1, 18), i.e. it teaches that the Self is active
in taking to itself the prânas and moving about in the body.




35. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the designation (of the Self as the agent) in
actions. If not so, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be change of grammatical expression.

Because in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Knowledge performs the sacrifice, it performs all
works' (Taitt. Up. II, 5) the Self is designated as the agent in all
worldly and Vedic works, for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also the Self must be held to
be an agent. And should it be said that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'knowledge' in that

that is to say, as the buddhi is the instrument of action, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> exhibit the instrumental <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> instead of the nominative <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> 'by
knowledge, and so on' (vijñânena instead of vijñânam).




36. (There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be) absence of definite rule, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
consciousness.

The Sûtra points out a difficulty which arises on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the Self
not being an agent. Sûtra 32 has declared that if the Self were all-
pervading it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no definite determination
with regard to consciousness. Similarly, if the Self were not an agent
but all activity belonged to Prakriti it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that as Prakriti
is a common possession of all souls, all actions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result in
enjoyment (experience) on the part of all souls, or else on the part of
none; for as each Self is held to be omnipresent, they are all of them
in equal proximity to all parts of the Pradhâna. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> it
could not be maintained that the distribution of results between the
different souls depends on the different internal organs which are
joined to the souls; for if the souls are omnipresent, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> will be
exclusively connected with any particular internal organ.




37. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the inversion of power.

If the internal organ were the agent, then--since it is impossible that
a being other than the agent should be the enjoyer of the fruit of the
action--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of enjoyment also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> belong to the internal organ,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> consequently have to be denied of the Self. But if this were
so, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no longer any proof for the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the Self;
for they expressly teach that 'the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> (i.e. the soul) exists, on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of enjoyment.'




38. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of samâdhi.

If the internal organ were the agent, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be such even in that
final <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of meditation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> samâdhi, which is the instrument of
Release. But that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> consists therein that the meditating being
realises its difference from Prakriti, and this is a conception which
Prakriti itself (of which the internal organ is only a modification)
cannot form. The Self alone, therefore, is the agent. But this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
imply that the activity of the Self is never at rest! Of this difficulty
the next Sûtra disposes.




39. And as the carpenter, in both ways.

The Self, although always provided with the instruments of action, such
as the organ of speech, and so on, acts when it wishes to do so, and
does not act when it does not wish to do so. Just as a carpenter,
although having his axe and other implements ready at hand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> or
does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> just as he pleases. If the internal organ, on the contrary,
were essentially active, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> constantly be acting, since as a non-
intelligent being it could not be influenced by particular reasons for
action, such as the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for enjoyment.

Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the agent.'




40. But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture.

Is the activity of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> independent (free), or does it
depend on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self? It is free; for if it were dependent on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of scriptural injunctions and prohibitions
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be unmeaning. For commandments can be addressed to such agents
only as are capable of entering on action or refraining from action,
according to their own <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and will.

This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra. The activity of the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> proceeds from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as its cause. For
Scripture teaches this. 'Entered within, the ruler of creatures, the
Self of all'; 'who dwelling in the Self is different from the Self, whom
the Self does not know, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the Self is, who rules the Self from
within, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> Self, the inward ruler, the immortal one.' Smriti
teaches the same, 'I dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of all; memory and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as their loss come from me'(Bha. Gî. XV, 15); 'The Lord, O
Arjuna, dwells in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of all creatures, whirling, by his
mysterious power, all creatures as if mounted on a machine' (Bha. Gî.
XVIII, 61).--But this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> implies the meaninglessness of all scriptural
injunctions and prohibitions!--To this the next Sûtra replies.




41. But with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the efforts made (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> act) on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the (thus resulting) non-meaninglessness of injunctions and
prohibitions and the rest.

The inwardly ruling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self promotes action in so far as it regards
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of any action the volitional effort made by the individual
soul, and then aids that effort by granting its favour or permission
(anumati); action is not possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> permission on the part of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> (i.e. since the action primarily depends on
the volitional effort of the soul) injunctions and prohibitions are not
devoid of meaning. The 'and the rest' of the Sûtra is meant to suggest
the grace and punishments awarded by the Lord.--The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to
that of property of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are joint owners. If one of these
wishes to transfer that property to a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> he cannot do so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the permission of his partner, but that that permission is given
is after all his own doing, and hence the fruit of the action (reward or
anything) properly belongs to him only.--That, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
actions, allowance of the action on the part of one able to stop it does
not necessarily prove hardheartedness, we have shown above when
explaining the Sânkhya doctrine.--But there is a scriptural text.--'He
(the Lord) makes him whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds do a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deed, and the same makes him whom he wishes to lead down from these
worlds do a bad deed' (Kau. Up. III, 8)--which means that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

with the partial independence claimed above for the soul.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
quoted, we reply, does not apply to all agents, but means that the Lord,
wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on acting so as fully
to please the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, engenders in their minds a tendency
towards highly virtuous actions, such as are means to attain to him;
while on the other hand, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to punish those who are resolved on

The Sûtras have declared that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is an agent, and as
such dependent on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person. The following question now arises--
Is the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> absolutely different from Brahman? or is it
nothing else than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself in so far as under the influence of

(upâdhi)? or is it a part (amsa) of Brahman?--The doubt on this point is
due to the disagreement of the scriptural texts.--But this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
has already been decided under Sû. II, 1, 22.--True. But as a difficulty
presents itself on the ground of the conflicting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the texts--
some asserting the difference and some the unity of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
and Brahman--the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is here more specially decided by its being
proved that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is a part of Brahman.

remains unsettled, the conclusions arrived at under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras
referred to, viz. that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is non-different from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and that

Let it then first be said that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is absolutely different from

9) declare their difference. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> which maintain the non-difference of

ground with fire'!-and must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be understood in some secondary
metaphorical sense. To hold that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is a part of

which constitutes part of the extension of something. If, then, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

divided into pieces, and moreover, the difficulties connected with the
former interpretation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> present themselves here also. That something
absolutely different from something else should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> be a part of the
latter cannot in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> be proved.

Or else let it be said that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> affected by error
(bhrama). For this is the teaching of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that';
'this Self is Brahman.' Those texts, on the other hand, which declare
the difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> merely restate what is already established by
perception and the other means of knowledge, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are shown, by
those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> the purport of which it is to teach non-duality not
established by other means, to lie--like perception and the other means
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> themselves--within the sphere of Nescience.

Or let it be assumed, in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> place, that the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is

it is on this ground that Scripture teaches the Self to be Brahman. And
that upâdhi must not be said to be a mere erroneous imagination, for on
that <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the distinction of bondage, release, and so on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
impossible.

Against all these views the Sûtra declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is a part of
Brahman; since there are declarations of difference and also 'otherwise,'
i.e. declarations of unity. To the former class belong all those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
which dwell on the distinction of the creator and the creature, the
ruler and the ruled, the all-knowing and the ignorant, the independent
and the dependent, the pure and the impure, that which is endowed with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> qualities and that which possesses qualities of an opposite kind,

'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that' and 'this Self is Brahman.' Some persons even record
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of slaves, fishermen, and so on.

Sûtra II, 3, 48 directly states the plurality of the individual Selfs.




44. Moreover it is so stated in Smriti.

Smriti moreover declares the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to be a part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

a part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> distinguished by that attribute. Hence those
analysing a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> of that kind discriminate between the _distinguishing_

Brahman.' The 'and' in the Sûtra implies that scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also ('of
whom the Self is the body' and others) declare that the individual Self
is a part of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so far as it is its body.

But if all individual souls are equal in so far as being alike parts of
Brahman, alike actuated by Brahman, and alike knowing subjects, what is
the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that, as Scripture teaches, some of them are allowed to read
the Veda and act according to its injunctions, while others are excluded
therefrom; and again that some are to see, feel, and so on, while others
are excluded from these privileges?--This question is answered by the
next Sûtra.




47. Permission and exclusion (result) from connexion with a body; as in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and so on.

Although all souls are essentially of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in so far as they
are parts of Brahman, knowing subjects and so on, the permissions and
exclusions referred to are possible for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that each individual

48. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-connectedness there is no confusion.

Although the souls, as being parts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and so on, are of
essentially the same character, they are actually separate, for each of
them is of atomic size and resides in a separate body. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
there is no confusion or mixing up of the individual spheres of
enjoyment and experience. The Sûtrakâra introduces this reference to an
advantage of his own <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of things, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to intimate that the views

adjunct are on their part incapable of explaining how it is that the
experiences of the individual Self and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, and of the
several individual Selfs, are not mixed up.

But may not, on the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> deluded, the
distinction of the several spheres of experience be explained by means
of the difference of the limiting adjuncts presented by Nescience?--This
the next Sûtra negatives.




49. And it is a mere apparent argument.

The argumentation by which it is sought to prove that that being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

differentiated by limiting adjuncts which presuppose an obscuration of
that essential nature, is a mere apparent (fallacious) one. For, as we
have shown before, obscuration of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of that which is nothing but
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> means destruction of that light.--If we accept as the reading of
the Sûtra 'âbhâsâh' (in plural) the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is that the various reasons
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth by the adherents of that doctrine are all of them fallacious.
The 'and' of the Sûtra is meant to point out that that doctrine,
moreover, is in conflict with <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'thinking himself to be
different from the Mover'(Svet. Up. I, 6); 'there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> unborn ones,
one a ruler, the other not a ruler' (I, 9); 'of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> one eats the
sweet fruit' (V, 6); and others. For even if difference is due to
upâdhis which are the figment of Nescience, there is no escaping the
conclusion that the spheres of experience must be mixed up, since the
theory admits that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself with which all the limiting adjuncts
connect themselves is one only.

But this cannot be urged against the theory of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> being
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so far as determined by real limiting adjuncts; for on that
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> we may explain the difference of spheres of experience as due to
the beginningless adrishtas which are the cause of the difference of the
limiting adjuncts!--To this the next Sûtra replies.




50. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the non-determination of the adrishtas.

As the adrishtas also which are the causes of the series of upâdhis have
for their substrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself, there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for their
definite allotment (to definite individual souls), and hence again there
is no definite separation of the spheres of experience. For the limiting
adjuncts as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the adrishtas cannot by their connexion with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
split up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself which is essentially one.




51. And it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> also in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of purposes and so on.

For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> there can be no definite restriction in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
purposes and so on which are the causes of the, different adrishtas. (For
they also cannot introduce plurality into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that is fundamentally
one.)




52. Should it be said (that that is possible) owing to the difference of
place; we deny this, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (all upâdhis) being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> (all
places).

Although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is one only and not to be split by the several limiting
adjuncts with which it is connected, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the separation of the spheres
of enjoyment is not impossible since the places of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which are
connected with the upâdhis are distinct.--This the Sûtra negatives on
the ground that, as the upâdhis move here and there and hence all places
enter into connexion with all upâdhis, the mixing up of spheres of
enjoyment cannot be avoided. And even if the upâdhis were connected with
different places, the pain connected with some particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
affect the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is one only.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras II, 3, 32
and 37 have stated an objection against those who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> taking their
stand on the Veda, held the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of an all-pervading soul. The Sûtras II,
3, 50 and ff., on the other hand, combat the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of those who, while
basing their doctrine on the Veda, teach the absolute unity of the Self.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the part.'




FOURTH PÂDA.

1. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the prânas.

After having taught that Ether and all the other elements are effects,
and hence have originated, the Sûtras had shown that the individual soul,
although likewise an effect, does not originate in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
undergoing a change of essential nature; and had in connexion therewith
clearly <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth wherein the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> consists.
They now proceed to elucidate the question as to the origination of the
instruments of the individual soul, viz. the organs and the vital breath.

The point here to be decided is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the organs are effects as the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is an effect, or as ether and the other elements are. As

That means--
as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not produced, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the organs also are not produced--For
the latter point no less than the former is directly stated in Scripture;
the wording of the Sûtra 'thus the prânas' being meant to extend to the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the prânas also, the authority of Scripture to which recourse
was had in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the soul.--But what is the scriptural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> you
mean?

'Non-being, truly this was in the beginning. Here they say, what was
that? Those Rishis indeed were that Non-being, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they say. And who
were those Rishis? The prânas indeed were those Rishis.' This is the
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which declares that before the origination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> the
Rishis existed. As 'prânâh' is in the plural, we conclude that what is
meant is the organs and the vital air. Nor can this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> be interpreted
to mean only that the prânas exist for a very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (but are not
uncreated); as we may interpret the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring Vâyu and the
atmosphere (antariksha) to be immortal: 'Vâyu and the atmosphere are
immortal'; 'Vâyu is the deity that never sets' (Bri. Up. II, 3, 3; I, 5,
22). For the clause 'Non-being indeed was this in the beginning'
declares that the prânas existed even at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
was in the pralaya state. Those texts, then, which <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of an
origination of the prânas must be explained somehow, just as we did with
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> referring to the origination of the individual soul.

To this the Siddhântin replies, 'the prânas also originate in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as ether, and so on.'--Why?--Because we have scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
directly stating that before <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> everything was one, 'Being only
this was in the beginning,' 'The Self only was this in the beginning.'
And moreover, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'from that there is produced the prâna and the

originated; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> cannot have existed before creation. Nor is
it permissible to ascribe a different <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare
the origination of the sense-organs--as we may do in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring the origination of the soul. For we have no <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
directly denying the origination of the sense-organs, or affirming their
eternity, while we _have_ such <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the individual soul.
In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted by the Pûrvapakshin, 'Non-being indeed was this in
the beginning,' &c., the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> prâna can denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only;
for from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'All these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> indeed enter into breath alone,
and from breath they arise'(Ch. Up. I, 11, 5), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> prâna is known
to be one of the designations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. And as to the clause
'the prânas indeed are those Rishis,' we remark that the term Rishi may
properly be applied to the all-seeing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, but not to the non-
intelligent organs.

But how then is the plural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> 'the Rishis are the prânas' to be
accounted for? This the next Sûtra explains.




2. (The scriptural statement of the plural) is secondary, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
impossibility; and since (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) is declared before that.

The plural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> exhibited by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> (not in its literal,
but) in a secondary figurative sense, since there is no room there for a
plurality of things. For Scripture declares that previous to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only exists.




3. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of speech having for its antecedent that.

For the following <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'prâna,' in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted, can
denote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only. Speech, i.e. the names which have for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> apart from Brahman, presupposes the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the entire
universe of things--ether, and so on--which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of speech. But,
as according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'this was then non-differentiated; it was
thereupon differentiated by names and forms,' then (i.e. before the
differentiation of individual things), no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> having name and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
existed, there existed also no effects of speech and the other organs of
action and sensation, and hence it cannot be inferred that those organs
themselves existed.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the origination
of the prânas.'




4. (They are seven) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the going of the seven and of
specification.

The question here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those organs are seven only, or eleven--
the doubt on this point being due to the conflicting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
scriptural texts.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former alternative.--
On what grounds?--'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of going, and of specification.' For the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to the 'going,' i.e. to the moving about in the different
worlds, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when being <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> or dying, of seven prânas
only, 'seven are these worlds in which the prânas move which rest in the
cave, being placed there as seven and seven' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 8)--where
the repetition 'seven and seven' intimates the plurality of souls to
which the prânas are attached. Moreover those moving prânas are
distinctly specified in the following text, 'when the five instruments
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> stand still, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (manas), and when the
buddhi does not move, that they <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> "going"' (gati--Ka. Up.
II, 6, 10). The 'highest going' here means the moving towards Release,
all movement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> having come to an end. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
declares that at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of birth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> seven prânas only accompany
the soul, and as, with regard to the condition of final concentration,
those prânas are distinctly specified as forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (jñânâni),
we conclude that the prânas are the seven following instruments of the
soul--the organs of hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting and smelling, the
buddhi and the manas. In various other passages indeed, which refer to
the prânas, <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> numbers are mentioned, viz. up to fourteen, speech,
the hands, the feet, the anus, the organ of generation, the ahankâra and
the kitta being added to those mentioned above; cp. e.g. 'there are
eight grahas' (Bri. Up. III, 2, i); 'Seven are the prânas of the head,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> the lower ones '(Taitt. Samh. V, 3, 2, 5). But as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says
nothing about those additional organs accompanying the soul, we assume
that they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prânas in a metaphorical <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only, since they all,
more or less, assist the soul.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra sets aside.




5. But the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and so on also; (since they assist the soul) abiding
(in the body). Hence (it is) not so.

The organs are not seven only, but eleven, since the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and the rest
also contribute towards the experience and fruition of that which abides
in the body, i.e. the soul, and have their separate offices, such as
seizing, and so on. Hence it is not so, i.e. it must not be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that
the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and the rest are not organs. Buddhi, ahankâra and kitta, on
the other hand, are (not independent organs but) mere designations of the
manas, according as the latter is engaged in the functions of deciding
(adhyavasâya), or misconception (abhimâna), or thinking (kintâ). The
organs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are eleven. From this it follows that in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
'Ten are these prânas in man, and Âtman is the eleventh' (Bri. Up. II, 4,
ii), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Âtman denotes the manas. The <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> _eleven_ is confirmed
by scriptural and Smriti passages, cp. 'the ten organs and the one' (Bha.
Gî. XIII, 5); 'ten are the vaikârika beings, the manas is the eleventh,'
and others. Where more organs are mentioned, the different functions of
the manas are meant; and references to smaller numbers are connected
with special effects of the organs, such as accompanying the soul, and
the like.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the going of the seven.'




6. And (they are) minute.

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'these are all alike, all infinite' (Bri. Up. I, 5, 13),
declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the
prânas are all-pervading.--To this the Sûtra replies, that they are
minute; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all
the prânas <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out after it' (Bri. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those prânas to
be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by
bystanders, they must be of minute size--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which speaks of them
as infinite is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoining <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> ('he who meditates on them as
infinite'), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities
which is an attribute of the prâna to be meditated on.




7. And the best.

By 'the best' we have to understand the chief vital air (mukhya prâna),
which, in the colloquy of the prânas, is determined to be the best
because it is the cause of the preservation of the body. This chief
vital air the Pûrvapakshin maintains to be something non-created, since
Scripture (Ri. Samh. V, 129, 2), 'By its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> the One was breathing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wind,' shows that an effect of it, viz. the act of breathing,
existed even previously to creation, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pralaya; and
because <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring it to have been created--such as 'from him is
<span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> breath' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3)--may be interpreted in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is something <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> (sec p. 540 ff.).--
To this the reply is that, since this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> contradicts scriptural
statements as to the oneness of all, previous to creation; and since the
Mundaka-text declares the prâna to have been <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and the other elements; and since there are no <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> plainly
denying its createdness, the chief vital air also must be held to have
been created. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'the One was breathing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wind' by no means
refer to the vital breath of living creatures, but intimate the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, alone by itself; as indeed appears
from the qualification 'without wind.'--That the vital breath, although
really disposed of in the preceding Sûtras, is specially mentioned in
the present Sûtra, is with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the question next raised for
consideration.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the minuteness of the
prânas.'




8. Neither air nor function, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being stated separately.

Is this main vital breath nothing else but air, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> of the
elements? Or is it a certain motion of the air? Or is it air that has
assumed some special condition?--The first alternative may be adopted,
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'prâna is air.'--Or, since mere air is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
breath, while this term is generally applied to that motion of air which
consists in inhalation and exhalation, we may hold that breath is a
motion of air.--Of both these views the Sûtra disposes by declaring 'not
so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of separate statement.' For in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'From him
there is produced breath, mind, and all sense-organs, ether and air,' &c,
breath and air are mentioned as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> separate things. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
breath also cannot be a mere motion or function of air; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
does not mention any functions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and the other elements, <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> by
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> with these elements, as separate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> (and this shows that breath
also cannot, in that text, be interpreted to denote a function of air).
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'prâna is air,' on the other hand, intimates (not that breath
is identical with air, but) that breath is air having assumed a special
form, not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> altogether different from it, like fire. In ordinary
language, moreover, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> _breath_ does not mean a mere motion but a
substance to which motion belongs; we say,'the breath moves to and fro
in inhalation and exhalation.'

Is breath, which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> know to be a modification of air, to be
considered as a kind of elementary substance, like fire, earth, and so
on? Not so, the next Sûtra replies.




9. But like the eye and the rest, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of being taught with them,
and for other reasons.

Breath is not an element, but like sight and the rest, a special
instrument of the soul. This appears from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
mention it <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the recognised organs of the soul, the eye, and
so on; so e.g. in the colloquy of the prânas. And such common mention is
suitable in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> only as belong to one class.--The
'and for other reasons' of the Sûtra refers to the circumstance of the
principal breath being specially mentioned among the organs comprised
under the term 'prâna'; cp. 'that principal breath' (Ch. Up. I, 2, 7);
'that central breath' (Bri. Up. I, 5, 21).--But if the chief breath is,
like the eye and the other organs, an instrument of the soul, there must
be some special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of activity through which it assists the soul, as
the eye e.g. assists the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> by seeing. But no such activity is
perceived, and the breath cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be put in the same category
as the organs of sensation and action!--To this objection the next Sûtra
replies.




10. And there is no objection on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its not having an activity
(karana); for (Scripture) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> declares.

The karana of the Sûtra means kriyâ, action. The objection raised on the
ground that the principal breath does not exercise any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of activity
helpful to the soul, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> force, since as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
Scripture declares that there is such an activity, in so far as the
vital breath supports the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with all its organs. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> (Ch. Up.
V, 1, 7 ff.) relates how on the successive departure of speech, and so
on, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the other organs maintained their strength, while on
the departure of the vital breath the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and all the organs at once
became weak and powerless.--The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the breath,
in its fivefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of prâna, apâna, and so on, subserves the purposes
of the individual soul, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> occupies the position of an instrument,
no less than the eye and the other organs.

But as those five forms of breath, viz. prâna, udâna, &c., have
different names and functions they must be separate principles (and
hence there is not _one_ principal breath)! To this the next Sûtra
replies.




11. It is designated as having five functions like mind.

As desire, and so on, are not principles different from mind, although
they are different functions and produce different effects--according to
the text, 'Desire, purpose, doubt, faith, want of faith, firmness,
absence of firmness, shame, reflection, fear--all this is mind' (Bri. Up.
I, 5, 3); so, on the ground of the text, 'prâna, apâna, vyâna, udâna,
samâna--all this is prâna' (ibid.), apâna and the rest must be held to
be different functions of prâna only, not independent principles.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of what is 'a modification of air.'




12. And (it is) minute.

This prâna also is minute, since as before (i.e. as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
organs) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares it to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out of the body, to move, and so on,
'him when he passes out the prâna follows after' (Bri. Up. V, 4, 2). A
further doubt arises, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of prâna, owing to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in
other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> it is spoken of as of large extent, 'It is equal to these
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> worlds, equal to this Universe' (Bri. Up. I, 3, 22); 'On prâna
everything is founded'; 'For all this is shut up in prâna.' But as the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declaring the passing out, and so on, of the prâna, prove it to be
of limited size, the all-embracingness ascribed to prâna in those other
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> must be interpreted to mean only that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of all living and
breathing creatures depends on breath.--Here terminates the adhikarana
of 'the minuteness of the best.'




13. But the rule (over the prânas) on the part of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> and the rest,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with him to whom the prâna belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to
the thinking of that (viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self); on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural
statement.

It has been shown that the prânas, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the main prâna,
originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the prânas are
guided by <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and other <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> has also been explained on a
previous occasion, viz. under Sû. II, 1, 5. And it is known from
ordinary experience that the organs are ruled by the individual soul,
which uses them as means of experience and fruition. And this is also
established by scriptural texts, such as 'Having <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> these prânas he
(i.e. the soul) moves about in his own body, according to his
pleasure'(Bri. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the rule
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and of the presiding <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> over the prânas depends
on them (i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the divinities) only, or on some other being.--
On them only, since they depend on no one else!--Not so, the Sûtra
declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and the other
divinities, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with him to whom the prânas belong i.e. the soul,
exercise over the prânas, proceeds from the thinking of that, i.e. from
the will of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--How is this known?--'From scriptural
statement.' For Scripture teaches that the organs, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with their
guiding divinities and the individual soul, depend in all their doings
on the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person. 'He, who abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> Fire,

14. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the eternity of this.

As the quality, inhering in all things, of being ruled by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Self, is <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> and definitely fixed by being connected with his
essential nature, it is an unavoidable conclusion that the rule of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and of the divinities over the organs depends on the will of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The text, 'Having sent forth this he entered into it,
having entered into it he became sat and tyat' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), shows
that the entering on the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> into all things, so
as to be their ruler, is connected with his essential nature. Similarly
Smriti says, 'Pervading this entire Universe by a portion of mine I do
abide' (Bha. Gî. X, 42).--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the rule of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Fire</span> and the rest.'




15. They, with the exception of the best, are organs, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
being so designated.

Are all principles <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prânas to be considered as 'organs'
(indriyâni), or is the 'best,' i.e. the chief prâna, to be excepted?--
All of them, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception, are organs; for they all are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
prânas equally, and they all are instruments of the soul.--Not so, the
Sûtra replies. The 'best' one is to be excepted, since only the prawas
other than the best are designated as organs. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'the organs
are ten and one' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 5) apply the term 'organ' only to the
senses of sight and the rest, and the internal organ.




16. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement of difference, and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
difference of characteristics.

<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'from him is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> prâna, and the internal organ, and all
organs' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) mention the vital breath separately from the
organs, and this shows that the breath is not one of the organs. The
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> indeed mentions the internal organ (manas) also as something
separate; but in other passages the manas is formally included in the
organs, 'the (five) organs with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as the sixth' (Bha. Gî. XV, 7).
That the vital breath differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from the organ of sight and the
rest, is a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of observation. For in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep the
function of breath is seen to continue, while those of the eye, and so
on, are not perceived. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the organs, inclusive of the manas,
is to act as instruments of cognition and action, while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
breath is to maintain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the organs. It is for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that
the subsistence of the organs depends on breath, that the organs
themselves are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prânas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> Scripture says, 'they all became the

(Bri. Up. I, 5, 21). 'They became its form' means--they became its body,
their activity depended on it.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the
_organs_.'




17. But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders
tripartite, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural teaching.

The Sûtras have shown that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the elements and organs in
their collective aspect (samashti) and the activity of the individual
souls proceed from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; and they have also further
confirmed the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that the rule which the souls exercise over their
organs depends on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. A question now arises with regard to
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in its discrete aspect (vyashti), which
consists in the differentiation of names and forms (i.e. of individual
beings). Is this latter <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Hiranyagarbha only, who
represents the collective aggregate of all individual souls; or,
fundamentally, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> having Hiranyagarbha for

alternative. For, he says, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Having entered with this living-
soul-self (anena jîvenât-manâ), let me differentiate names and forms'
(Ch. Up. VI, 3, 2), declares the jîva-soul to be the agent in
differentiation. For the resolve of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> deity is expressed, not
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> 'let me differentiate names and forms by myself (svena

'having entered,' which indicates the agent, could not be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in their
literal, but only in an implied, sense--as is the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in a sentence
such as 'Having entered the hostile army by means of a spy, I will
estimate its strength' (where the real agent is not the king, who is the
speaker, but the spy).--The cases are not analogous, the Pûrvapakshin
replies. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and the spy are fundamentally separate, and hence

instrumental <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> ('with this soul-self') has the implied <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of

in its primary sense, it is not proper to understand it in a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> which
has to be expressed by means of a preposition. But the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> case,
jîvena, cannot here be understood even in its primary sense, i.e. that

differentiation of names and forms is Brahman's work, for the past

Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra declares itself. The differentiation of

Brahman; since it is assigned by Scripture to the latter only. For the

have one and the same agent. But the rendering tripartite cannot belong
to Brahma (Hiranyagarbha), who abides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Brahma-egg, for that

of names and forms, which belongs to the same agent, also is Brahman's

(as constituting its body), let me differentiate names and forms, i.e.

differentiation of names and forms is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

But, an objection is raised, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the differentiation of names
and forms must be due to the same agent as the rendering tripartite,
does not after all prove that the former is due to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. For
the rendering tripartite may itself belong to the individual soul. For

But, a final objection is raised, as on this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> the

threefold nature, how can they be designated each of them by a simple
term--_earth_, _water_, _fire_?--To this the next Sûtra replies.

[FOOTNOTE 581:1. I.e. if the tripartition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> (i. e. solid food)

which is described in VI, 3, 3-4, we should have to conclude that the

[FOOTNOTE 583:1. That means--in reality the tripartition of the elements
came first, and after that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of individual beings.]

that designation.

Each element indeed is of a threefold nature, owing to the primary
tripartition; but as in each mixed element one definite element prevails--
so that each element has a distinctive character of its own--a definite
designation is given to each.--The repetition (of 'that designation') in
the Sûtra indicates the completion of the adhyâya.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the fashioning of names and forms.'

the only cause of the entire world, which is not touched by even a
shadow of imperfection, which is an ocean, as it were, of supremely
exalted qualities, and which totally differs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from all other

against the Vedânta doctrine on the basis of Smriti and reasoning, to
refute the views held by other schools, to show that the different
Vedânta-texts do not contradict each other, and to prove that the Self
is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of activities (enjoined in injunctions of meditation, and
so on). In short, those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> adhyâyas have <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of Brahman. The subsequent part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> now makes it its task to
enquire into the mode of attaining to Brahman, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the means
of attainment. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> adhyâya is concerned with an enquiry into
meditation--which is the means of attaining to Brahman; and as the
motive for entering on such <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is supplied by the absence of all
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for what is other than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be obtained, and by the
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for that thing, the points first to be enquired into are the
imperfections of the individual soul--moving about in the different
worlds, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> waking or dreaming or merged in dreamless sleep, or in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of swoon; and those <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> characteristics by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
is raised above all these imperfections. These are the topics of the
first and <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> pâdas of the adhyâya.

The first question to be considered is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the soul, when moving
from one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into another, is enveloped by those subtle rudiments of
the elements from which the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is produced, or not. The
Pûrvapakshin maintains the latter alternative; for, he says, wherever
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> goes it can easily provide itself there with those rudiments.
Other reasons supporting this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> will be mentioned and
refuted further on.--The Sûtra states the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> finally accepted, 'In
obtaining another "of that" it goes enveloped.' The 'of that' refers
back to the form, i.e. body, mentioned in II, 4, 17. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when
moving towards another embodiment goes enveloped by the rudiments of the
elements. This is known 'from question and explanation,' i.e. answer.
Question and answer are recorded in the 'Knowledge of the five fires'
(Ch. Up. V, 3-10), where Pravâhana, after having addressed to Svetaketu
several other questions, finally asks 'Do you know why in the fifth
libation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> man?' In answer to this last question the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

into the heavenly world, imagined as a sacrificial fire, the oblation

offered becomes rain; how the same prânas throw that rain on to the
earth, also imagined as a sacrificial fire, whereupon it becomes food;
how this <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is then offered into man, also compared to fire, where it
becomes seed; and how, finally, this seed is offered into woman, also
compared to a fire, and there becomes an embryo. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> then goes on,

declares, 'He is like a beast for the devas' (Bri. Up. I, 4, 10). Smriti
also declares, that while those who know the Self attain to Brahman,
those who do not know it are means of enjoyment for the devas, 'To the

Scripture and Smriti; as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> and not so.

when they have fully enjoyed the fruit of their works, 'having dwelt
there yâvat sampâtam, they return by the same way' (Ch. Up. V, 10, 5).

enjoyed the fruit of all its works. For by 'anusaya' we have to
understand that part of the karman which remains over and above the part
retributively enjoyed; but when the fruit of the entire karman has been
enjoyed, there is no such remainder. And that this is so we learn from
the phrase 'yâvat sampâtam ushitvâ,' which means 'having dwelt there as

the following: 'A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is not pure is unfit for all religious work,'

11. But only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> works, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Bâdari thinks.

As the verb â-kar takes karman for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> (punyam karmâ karati, &c.),
and as the separate denotation (i.e. the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of apparently equivalent
words, viz. âkar and karman) can be accounted for on the ground that one
of them refers to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> established by manifest texts, and the other to
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> inferred from actually existing rules of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> conduct; and as,

This opinion of Bâdari, the author of the Sûtra states as representing
his own. On the other hand, he adopts the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Kârshnajini in so far
as he considers such items of virtuous _conduct_ as the Sandhyâ--which
are enjoined by scriptural texts, the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of which is inferred on
the basis of conduct as enjoined by Smriti--to have the result of
qualifying the agent for the performance of other works.--The conclusion
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the souls descend, carrying a remnant of their works.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the passing of works.'




12. Of those also who do not perform sacrifices (the ascent) is declared
by Scripture.

It has been said that those who perform only sacrifices, and so on, go
to the moon and thence return with a remainder of their works. The
question now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those also who do not perform sacrifices go
to the moon. The phrase 'who do not perform sacrifices' denotes evil-
doers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, viz. those who do not do what is enjoined, and those
who do what is forbidden.--These also go to the moon, the Pûrvapakshin
maintains; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> contains a statement to that effect, 'All who
depart from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> go to the moon' (Ka. Up. I, 2)--where it is said
that all go, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any distinction. So that those who perform <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

the next Sûtra negatives.




13. But of the others having enjoyed in Samyamana, there is ascent and
descent; as such a course is declared.

Of the others, i.e. those who do not perform sacrifices, and so on,
there is ascent to the moon and descent from there, only after they have
in the kingdom of Yama suffered the punishments due to their actions.
For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that evil-doers fall under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Yama, and
have to go to him, 'He who thinks, this is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> there is no other,
falls again and again under my sway' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 6); 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of
Vivasvat, the gathering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of men' (Rik Samh. X, 14, 1); 'King Yama,'
and other texts.




14. Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also declare this.

That all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are under the sway of Yama, Parâsara also and other
Smriti writers declare, 'And all these <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> under the sway of Yama.'




15. Moreover there are seven.

The Smritis moreover declare that there are seven hells, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Raurava,
and so on, to which evil-doers have to go.--But how do they, if moving
about in those seven places, reach the palace of Yama?




16. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of his activity there also, there is no contradiction.

As their going to those seven places also is due to the command of Yama,
there is no contradiction.--Thus those also who do not perform
sacrifices, and so on, after having gone to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Yama, and there
undergone punishments according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of their works, later on
ascend to the moon and again descend from there.--Of this conclusion the
next Sûtra disposes.




17. But, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and work--as these are the leading topics.

The 'but' sets aside the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> developed so far. It cannot be admitted
that those also who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, reach the moon;
because the path of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and the path of the fathers are meant for
the enjoyment of the fruits 'of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and work.'That is to say--as
those who do not perform sacrifices cannot ascend by the path of the
gods, since they are destitute of knowledge; so they also cannot go by
the path of the fathers, since they are destitute of meritorious works.
And that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> paths are dependent respectively on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
works, we know from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are the leading topics. For
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> forms the leading topic with regard to the path of the gods,
'Those who know this, and those who in the forest follow <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and
austerities, go to light,' &c.; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> have the same position with
regard to the path of the fathers, "they who living in a village perform
sacrifices, &c. go to the smoke," &c. The text, 'all those who depart
from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> go to the moon,' must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be interpreted to mean
'all those who perform sacrifices go to the moon.'--But if evil-doers do
not go to the moon, the fifth oblation cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> place, and no new

For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says, 'In the fifth oblation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is

soul's going to the moon. In order, therefore, to understand how in
their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> also a new embodiment is possible, it must needs be admitted
that they also ascend to the moon.--To this the next Sûtra replies.




18. Not in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> (place), as it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> perceived.

The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> 'place' does not, for the origination of a new body, depend on
the fifth oblation. The term,'the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> place,' denotes mere evil-doers.
That these do not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the
fifth oblation, is seen from Scripture. For, in answer to the question
'Do you know why that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> never becomes full?' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says, 'On

As this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> states that in
consequence of 'the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> place' (i.e. the creatures forming a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span>
class) not ascending to and descending from the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that

the origination of bodies, depend on the fifth oblation. The clause, 'in
the fifth oblation,' moreover, merely states that the connexion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

19. It moreover is recorded, in the world.

Smriti, moreover, states that the bodies of some specially meritorious
persons, such as Draupadî, Dhrishtadyumna and others, were formed
independently of the fifth oblation' (i.e. sexual union).




20. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of its being seen.

And it is seen in Scripture also, that the bodies of some <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
originate independently of the fifth oblation: 'Of all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> there are
indeed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> origins only, that which springs from an egg, that which
springs from a living being, that which springs from a germ' (Ch. Up. VI,
3, 1). It is observed that from among these <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> those springing from
a germ and those springing from heat originate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> that fifth
oblation.--But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted does not refer to the creatures springing
from heat; for it says that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> origins only!--To this the
next Sûtra replies.




21. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> term includes that which springs from heat.

Creatures sprung from heat are included in the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> term--viz. that
which springs from a germ--which is exhibited in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted. The
settled conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that the evil-doers do not go to the
moon.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'those who do not perform
sacrifices.'




22. There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being a
reason.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> describes the manner in which those who perform sacrifices, and
so on, descend from the moon as follows: 'They return again that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as
they came, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then having become
air they become smoke, having become smoke they become mist,' &c. The
doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when reaching ether, and so on,
becomes ether in the same <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> as here on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> it becomes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or
other being, or merely becomes similar to ether, and so on.--The former
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> one; for as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the sraddhâ <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> becomes the
moon, so it must likewise be held to _become_ ether, and so on, there
being no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for a difference in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> cases.--This primâ facie
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. The descending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> enters into similarity of
being with ether, and so on; since there is a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for this. When the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> becomes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or becomes the moon, there is a <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for that,
since it thereby becomes capacitated for the enjoyment of pain and
pleasure. But there is no similar <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> becoming ether,
and so on, and hence the statement that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> becomes ether, and so
on, can only mean that, owing to contact with them, it becomes similar
to them.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'entering into similarity of
being.'




23. Not very long; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of special statement.

Does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its descent through ether, and so on, stay at each
stage for a not very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time, or is there nothing to define that time?--
It stays at each stage for an indefinite time, there being nothing to
define the time.--

Not so, the Sûtra decides. For there is a special statement, i.e. the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has become rice or grain or the like, the
passing out of that stage is beset with difficulties. From this we infer
that as there is no such statement concerning the earlier stages, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> stays at each of them for a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> only.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the not very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time.'




24. Into (plants) animated by other souls, because the statement is as
in the previous cases.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares that 'he descending souls are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as rice, corn,'
&c., 'they are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> here as rice, corn, herbs, trees,' &c. The question
here is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the souls cling to plants animated by other souls which
have those plants for their bodies; or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the descending souls
themselves are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> with those plants for their bodies.--The latter <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
is the right one; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says, 'they are <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as rice, grain,' and
so on, and this expression is of the same kind as when we say 'he is
<span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as a man, as a deva,' and so on. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> means that the
souls are embodied in the different plants.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra
rejects. The souls merely cling to those plants which constitute the
bodies of other souls; 'since the statement is as in the previous
cases,' i.e. because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> only says that the souls become plants as
it had previously been said that they become ether, and so on. Where the

to karman. For those works--viz. sacrifices and the like--which were
undertaken with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to reward, such as enjoyment of the heavenly
world, are, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the descending souls, completely wiped out by
the enjoyment of the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (which precedes the descent of the
souls); and those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> on the other hand, the action of which has not

<span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> as plants, the statement cannot be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in its literal sense.




25. It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture.

The conclusion arrived at above cannot be accepted, since there is a
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why the descending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> should enter on the condition of an
enjoying soul. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> as sacrifices, the fruit of which is the
enjoyment of the heavenly world, are mixed with evil, for they imply
injury to living <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the goat offered to Agnîshomau.
And such injury is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> as it is forbidden by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'let him not
harm any creature.' Nor can it be said that the injunctions of
sacrificing animals constitute exceptions to the general rule of not
harming any creature.--For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> injunctions refer to different things.
The injunction to kill the goat for Agnîshomau intimates that the
killing of the animal subserves the accomplishment of the sacrifice,
while the injunction not to 'harm' teaches that such harming has
disastrous consequences. Should it be said that the prohibition of
harming does not refer to such actions as the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> of the goat
which proceed on the basis of scriptural injunction, but only to such
actions as spring from natural passion or <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> (râga); we remark that
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sacrifices also the action is equally prompted by natural
desire. Injunctions such as 'He who desires the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to
sacrifice', teach that sacrifices are to be undertaken by persons
desirous of certain pleasant results, and such persons having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
learned by what means the result is to be accomplished proceed to action
from the natural <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of the result. This applies to the killing of
the goat also which is offered to Agnîshomau; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> learns from Scripture
that such actions help to accomplish the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> which effects the
result, and then performs those actions from natural desire. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> in
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> differs from that of harm done in ordinary life--where the agent
always is prompted by natural desire, having somehow arrived at the
conclusion that his action will accomplish something aimed at by himself.
The same holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of permanent obligation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span>
learn from Scripture that through the performance of the special duties
of their caste they attain happiness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> kind, and then apply
themselves to their duties from a natural <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of such happiness, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> also are mixed with evil. Hence the souls of those
who have performed sacrifices, and so on, which contain an element of
evil, at first experience in the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that result which is to
be enjoyed there, and then embodying themselves in non-moving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
such as plants, experience the fruit of that part of their actions which
is of a harmful nature. That embodiment in non-moving <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is the
result of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds Smriti declares: 'Owing to those defects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
which are due to the body, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> becomes a non-moving being.' From all
this it follows that the souls embody themselves in plants to the end of
enjoying the fruits of their works.--To this the Sûtra replies--it is
not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural statement. For Scripture declares that
the killing of sacrificial animals makes them to go up to the heavenly
world, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of harm. This is declared in
the text, 'The animal killed at the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> having assumed a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

heavenly world.' An action which is the means of supreme exaltation is
not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of harm, even if it involves some little pain; it
rather is of beneficial nature.--With this the mantra also agrees: 'Thou
dost not die, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> goest to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> on easy paths; where virtuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

which has a healing tendency, although it may cause a transitory pain,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of insight declare to be preservative and beneficial.




26. After that conjunction with him who performs the act of generation.

The declaration that the descending souls _become_ rice plants, and so
on, cannot be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> literally for that <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
afterwards declares them to _become_ those who perform the act of
generation: 'Whoever the being may be that eats the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and begets
offspring, that being he (i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> that has descended) becomes.'
Now the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of this latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> can only be that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> enters
into conjunction with the creature which eats the grain; and hence we
have to interpret the previous text, as to the soul's becoming a plant,
in the same way.




27. From the yoni the body.

Only after having reached a yoni the soul, affected with a remnant of
its works, obtains a new body, and only in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> there can be the
enjoyment of pleasure and pain. When, therefore, previous to that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is said to reach ether, wind, and so on, this can only mean that it
enters into conjunction with them.--Here terminates the adhikarana of
'that animated by another soul.'




<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">SECOND</span> PÂDA.

1. In the intermediate sphere the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> (is effected by the soul);
for (Scripture) says (so).

So far it has been shown that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the waking <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> suffers
affliction since, in accordance with its deeds, it goes, returns, is
born, and so on. Next an enquiry is instituted into its condition in the
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of dream. With reference to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of dreaming Scripture says,
'There are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads; then he
creates chariots, horses and roads. There are no blessings, no happiness,
no joys; then he himself creates blessings, happiness, joys, and so on.
For he is the creator' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 10). A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of chariots and the rest is accomplished by the individual
soul, or by the Lord.--'The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> in the intermediate state' is due
to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only. 'The intermediate state' means the sphere
of dreams, in agreement with the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'There is a <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> intermediate
state, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of dreams' (Bri. Up. IV, 3, 1). And that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> is
effected by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> only; for what is referred to in the passages 'he
creates,' 'For he is the maker,' is none other but the dreaming soul.




2. And some (state the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to be) the shaper; and sons, and so on.

And the followers of one sâkhâ <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> that the dreaming
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is the shaper of its desires: 'He, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who is awake in those
who sleep, shaping one desired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> (kâma) after the other.' The term
'kâma' there denotes not mere desires, but such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and the
like which are objects of desire. For <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and so on are introduced as
'kâmas' in previous passages: 'Ask for all kâmas according to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> wish';
'Choose <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and grandsons living a hundred years' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 25;
23). The individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> creates chariots, and so on, in its dreams.
That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of realising all its wishes is known from
the declaration of Prajâpati. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> able to create, even in
the absence of special instruments.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the next
Sûtra.




3. But it is mere Mâyâ; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (of the soul) not

'Mâyâ' denotes wonderful things, as appears from passages such as 'She

The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
'there are no chariots,' &c. then is--there are no chariots and horses
to be perceived by any other <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> but the dreaming one; and then 'he

can immediately realise all his wishes; but not for the individual soul.

The _but_ sets the objection aside. Owing to the wish of the highest, i.
e. the Supreme Person, the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
hidden. The Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> hides the true, essentially blessed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>

karman. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it stated in Scripture that the bondage
and release of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> result from the wish of the Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> only
'when he finds freedom from <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> and rest in that invisible, incorporeal,
undefined, unsupported; then he has gone to fearlessness '; 'for he
alone causes blessedness'; 'from <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of it the wind blows' (Taitt. Up.
II, 7, 8).




5. Or that (results) also from connexion with the body.

The obscuration of the soul's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> results either from the soul's

who sleep and is the abode of all worlds ('in that all the worlds abide,
and no one goes beyond it'--Ka. Up. II, 4, 9) can apply to the Supreme
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> only. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen by an individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its dreams

6. And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also
declare.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seen in dreams are not <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the wish of the individual

prophetic of future <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or ill fortune.

infer success from his dream vision.' Those also who understand the
science of dreams teach that dreams foreshadow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> fortune.
But that which depends on one's own wish can have no prophetic quality;
and as ill fortune is not desired the dreamer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> create for himself
only such visions as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> indicate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune. Hence the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span>
which takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in dreams can be the Lord's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> only.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'the intermediate state.'




7. The absence of that takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the nâdîs and in the Self,
according to scriptural statement.

Next the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep dreamless sleep is enquired into. Scripture says,
'When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, so that he sees no

he is in profound sleep and is conscious of nothing, there are seventy-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> veins <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> hita which from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> spread through the
pericardium. Through them he moves forth and rests in the pericardium'
(Bri. Up. II, 1, 19). 'When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> sleeps here, he becomes united with
the True' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 1). These <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare the veins, the
pericardium, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of deep sleep; and hence there
is a doubt <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> each of them in turns, or all of them together, are
that place. There is an option between them, since they are not in
mutual dependence, and since the sleeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> cannot at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
be in several places!--To this the Sûtra replies--the absence of dreams,
i.e. deep sleep takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the veins, in the pericardium, and in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self together; since these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> are declared by Scripture. When
different alternatives may be combined, on the ground of there being
different effects in each case, it is improper to assume an option which
implies sublation of some of the alternatives. And in the present <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
such combination is possible, the veins and the pericardium holding the
position of a mansion, as it were, and a couch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the mansion, while

resting-place of the sleeping soul.




8. Hence the awaking from that.

Since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> alone directly is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of deep sleep, Scripture is
able to declare that the souls awake from that, i.e. Brahman; compare
'Having come back from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> they do not know that they come from the
True' (Ch. Up. VI, 10, 2), and other texts.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the absence of that.'




9. But the same, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of work, remembrance, text, and injunction.

Does the same <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who had gone to sleep rise again at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
waking, or a different one?--Since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in deep sleep frees itself
from all limiting adjuncts, unites itself with Brahman, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being

connected with its previous body, organs, and so on; the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> rising
from sleep is a different one.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside, saying
'but the same.' For there remains the work, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds
previously done by the sleeper, for which the same <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> has to undergo
retribution before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> arises. There is next
remembrance--'I, the waking person, am the same as I who was asleep.'
Scripture also declares this: 'Whatever these creatures are here,
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> a lion, or tiger, or wolf, &c., that they become again' (Ch. Up.
VI, 10, 2). And, lastly, the injunctions which enjoin certain acts for

10. In the swooning <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> there is half-combination; this being the
remaining (hypothesis).

With regard to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> lying in a swoon or stunned, the question arises
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of swoon is one of the other states, viz. deep sleep
and so on, or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it is a special condition of its own.--The former
alternative must be accepted. For the term 'swoon' may be explained as
denoting either deep sleep or some other acknowledged state, and there
is no authority for assuming an altogether different new state.--This
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. The condition of a swooning <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> consists
in reaching half, viz. of what leads to death; for this is the only
hypothesis remaining. A swoon cannot be either dreaming or being awake;
for in a swoon there is no consciousness. And as it is different in
character as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the occasions giving rise to it from deep sleep
and death, it cannot be either of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> states; for there are
special circumstances occasioning a swoon, such as a blow on the head.
The only possible alternative then is to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> a swoon as a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> in
which there is made a half-way approach to death. For while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span>
consists in the complete cessation of the soul's connexion with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
or organs of any kind, a swoon consists in the soul's remaining
connected with the subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and organs only. Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the swooning person.'

Highest; for everywhere (it is described) as having twofold
characteristics.

The different states of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> have been discussed, to the
end that an insight into their imperfections may give rise to
indifference towards all worldly enjoyments. Next now, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to give
rise to the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of attaining to Brahman, the Sûtras proceed to
expound how Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is raised above all imperfections and
constituted by mere <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> qualities. The following point requires to
be considered first. Do those imperfections which cling to the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in consequence of its different states--viz. the waking
state, dreams, deep sleep, swoon, departure from the body--affect also

those different states, or not?--They do affect it, since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> abides

as I, 2, 8 have already declared that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, because not
subject to the influence of karman, is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all imperfections; how
then can imperfections cling to it for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it is connected
with this or that place?--In the following way. As was shown under III,
2, 6, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> give rise to imperfection and suffering in so far as they
cause the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> with a body. The efficient cause therein
is the imperfection inherent in the connexion with a body; for otherwise
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> themselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> directly give rise to pain, and what then
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the connexion with a body? Hence, even in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of a being not subject to karman, its connexion with various unholy
bodies will cause imperfection and suffering. And even when such a being
voluntarily enters into such bodies in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to rule them, connexion
with imperfections is unavoidable; no less than to be immersed in blood

Of this primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes by saying--'Not even from

These and other

12. Should it be said 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference'; not so, because with

conclusion that the inner Ruler also, although in reality possessing

18. For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> comparisons, such as reflected images of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the like.

Because Brahman, although abiding in manifold places, ever possesses the
twofold characteristics, and hence does not share the imperfections due
to those places, scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> illustrate its purity in the midst of
inferior surroundings by comparing it to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> reflected in water,
mirrors, and the like. Compare e.g., 'As the one ether is rendered
manifold by jars and the like, or as the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> becomes manifold in
several sheets of water; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the one Self is rendered manifold by
abiding in many places. For the Self of all beings, although one, abides
in each separate being and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> seen as one and many at the same time,
as the moon reflected in water.'




19. But because it is not apprehended like water, there is no equality.

The 'but' indicates an objection.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is not apprehended
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and other places in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> or a face is
apprehended in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> or a mirror. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and a face are erroneously
apprehended as abiding in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> or a mirror; they do not really abide
there. When, on the other hand, Scripture tells us that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
dwells in the earth, in water, in the soul, &c., we apprehend it as
really dwelling in all those places. That the imperfections caused by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and mirrors do not attach themselves to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> or a face is due
to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the face do not really abide in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>

compared (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self) and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to which it is compared (the
reflected image).




20. The participation (on Brahman's part) in increase and decrease, due
to its abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> (is denied); on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the appropriateness of
both (comparisons), and because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is seen.

The comparison of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self to the reflected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the rest is
meant only to deny of the Self that it participates in the imperfections--
such as increase, decrease, and the like--which attach to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and

From the circumstance that on this supposition both comparisons are
appropriate. In the scriptural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is compared to
ether, which although one becomes manifold through the things--jars and
so on--within it; and to the sun, which is multiplied by the sheets of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in which he is reflected. Now the employment of these comparisons--
with ether which really does abide <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the jars and so on, and with
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> which in reality does not abide in the water--is appropriate
only if they are meant to convey the idea that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self does not
participate in the imperfections inherent in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and so on. Just as
ether, although connecting itself separately with jars, pots, and so on,
which undergo increase and decrease, is not itself touched by these
imperfections; and just as the sun, although seen in sheets of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> of
unequal extent, is not touched by their increase and decrease; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, although abiding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> variously-shaped beings, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>

imperfections--increase, decrease, and so on--remains one although

An objection is raised. In the Brihad-âranyaka, in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> beginning

this the next Sûtra replies.




21. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> denies the previously declared so-muchness; and

It is impossible to understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'not so, not so' as negativing

earlier part of the section are distinctive attributes of Brahman--as
which they are not known by any other means of proof--and thereupon
deliberately negative his own teaching. Although among the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

previously described 'so-muchness' of Brahman; i.e. the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> denies
that limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being

This name is explained in the next clause, 'for the prânas,' &c. The
term prânas here denotes the individual souls, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> because the
prânas accompany them. They are the 'True' because they do not, like the

connected with certain qualities, the clause 'not so, not so' (to which
that <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is complementary) cannot deny that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> possesses

twofold characteristics. That the clause 'not so' negatives Brahman's
being fully described by the attributes previously mentioned, was above
proved on the ground that since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is not the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of any other
means of proof, those previous statements cannot refer to what is
already proved, and that the final clause cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be meant to
deny what the previous clauses expressly teach. The next Sûtra now
confirms this circumstance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> not lying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere of the
other means of proof.




22. That (is) unmanifested; for (this Scripture) declares.

'His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> is not to be seen, no one beholds him with the eye' (Ka. Up.
II, 6, 9); 'He is not apprehended by the eye nor by speech' (Mu. Up. III,
1, 8).




23. Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and Smriti.

Moreover, it is only in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of perfect conciliation or endearment,
i.e. in <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> bearing the character of devotion, that an intuition
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> takes place, not in any other state. This Scripture and
Smriti alike teach. 'That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by

of Brahman's possessing twofold characteristics.




25. Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is infinite; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the

By the arguments stated it is proved that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is distinguished by
the infinite multitude of <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> qualities. And this being so, it
follows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> possesses the twofold characteristics.--Here

It has been shown in the preceding adhikarana that the entire non-

proving Brahman's freedom from all imperfection, an enquiry is now begun
into the particular mode in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> may be conceived to

<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> a part (amsa) of Brahman?--On the assumption of this last
alternative, which is about to be established here, it has been already
shown under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> preceding Sûtras (I, 4, 23; II, 1, 14), that from

The Sûtras now proceed to refute an erroneous <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> based on some
fallacious arguments, viz. that there is a being <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> even than the

bank (or bridge), a boundary' (Ch. Up. VIII, 4, 1) designates the Self
as a bank or bridge (setu). And the term 'setu' means in ordinary
language that which enables one to reach the other bank of a river; and
from this we conclude that in the Vedic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> also there must be meant
something to be reached. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> further says that that bridge is to be
crossed: 'He who has crossed that bridge, if blind,' &c.; this also
indicates that there must be something to be reached by crossing. Other
texts, again, <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as something measured, i.e.
limited. 'Brahman has four feet (quarters), sixteen parts.' Such
declarations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being something limited suggest the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of
something unlimited to be reached by that bridge. Further there are
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which declare a connexion of the bridge as that which is a means
towards reaching, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> connected with the bridge as that to be

the bridge of the Immortal' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5). For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also
there is something <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the Highest.--And other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> again
expressly <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that being beyond the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> to be something different:
'he goes to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the Highest' (Mu.

9-10). All this combined shows that there is something <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.--The next Sûtra disposes of this view.




31. But on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of resemblance.

The 'but' sets aside the pûrvapaksha. There is no <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in the assertion
that from the designation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> as a bridge (or bank) it
follows that there is something beyond the Highest. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in that

since the additional clause 'for the non-confounding of these worlds'
declares that it is compared to a bridge or bank in so far as it binds
to itself (setu being derived from _si_, to bind) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> aggregate of

And in the
clause 'having passed beyond that bridge' the _passing beyond_ means
_reaching_; as we say, 'he passes beyond the Vedanta,' <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> 'he has
fully mastered it.'




32. It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the feet.

Where the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as having four quarters, and sixteen
parts, or say that 'one quarter of him are all these beings' (Ch. Up.
III, 12, 6), they do so for the purpose of thought, i.e. meditation,
only. For as <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'the Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman'
teach Brahman, the cause of the world, to be unlimited, it cannot in
itself be subject to measure. The <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> referring to measure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
aim at <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Speech is one
foot (quarter) of him, breath another, the eye another, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
another' (Ch. Up. III, 18, 2).--But how can something that in itself is
beyond all measure, for the purpose of meditation, be spoken of as
measured? To this the next Sûtra replies.




33. Owing to difference of place, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of light, and so on.

Owing to the difference of limiting adjuncts constituted by special
places, such as speech, and so on, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in so far as connected with
these adjuncts may be viewed as having measure; just as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and the
like although spread everywhere may be viewed as limited, owing to its
connexion with different places--windows, jars, and so on.




34. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of possibility.

Nor is there any <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in the assertion that, because <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'he
is the bridge of the Immortal' intimate a distinction between that which
causes to reach and the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> reached, there must be something to be
reached different from that which causes to reach; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
may be viewed as being itself a means towards itself being reached; cp.
'The Self cannot be reached by the Veda, and so on; he whom the Self
chooses by him the Self can be gained' (Ch. Up. I, 2, 23).




35. Thus, from the denial of anything else.

Nor can we allow the assertion that there is something <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> because certain <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> ('the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> which is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the
highest'; 'beyond the Imperishable there is the highest,' &c.) refer to
such a difference. For the same <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> expressly deny that there is
anything else <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the highest--'than whom there is nothing else
higher, than whom there is nothing smaller or larger' (Svet. Up. III, 9).
So also other texts: 'For there is nothing else <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than this "not
so"' (i.e. than this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> designated by the phrase 'not so'; Bri. Up.
II, 3, 6); 'Of him none is the Lord, his name is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> glory' (Mahânâr.
Up. I, 10).

means the aggregate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (samashâ-purusha), which in a previous <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
had been said to be 'higher than the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> Imperishable' (II, 1, 2); and
the 'higher' refers to the Supreme Person, with all his transcendent
qualities, who is superior to the aggregate soul.




36. The omnipresence (possessed) by that, (understood) from the
declaration of extent.

That omnipresence which is possessed 'by that,' i.e. by Brahman, and
which is known 'from declarations of extent,' and so on, i.e. from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
which declare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be all-pervading, is also known from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such
as 'higher than that there is nothing.' Declarations of extent are e.g.
the following: 'By this <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Universe is filled' (Svet. Up.
III. 9); 'whatever is seen or <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in this world, is pervaded inside
and outside by Nârâyana' (Mahânâr. Up.); 'The eternal, pervading,
omnipresent, which the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">Wise</span> consider as the source of all beings' (Mu.
Up. I, 1, 6). The 'and the rest' in the Sâtra comprises passages such as
'Brahman indeed is all this,' 'The Self indeed is all this,' and the
like. The conclusion is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is absolutely supreme.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the Highest.'




37. From thence the reward; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of possibility.

It has been shown, for the purpose of giving rise to a <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> for devout
meditation, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in all its states is imperfect, while the
Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> to be reached by it is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from imperfections, the owner
of <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> qualities and <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than everything else. Being about to
investigate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of meditation, the Sûtrakâra now declares that
the meditating devotee receives the reward of meditation, i.e. Release,
which consists in attaining to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, from that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> only: and that analogously the rewards for all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> prescribed
by the Veda--whether to be enjoyed in this or the next world--come from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> only. The Sûtra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> says generally, 'from
thence the reward.'--'Why so?'--'Because that only is possible.'

For it is he only--the all-knowing, all-powerful, supremely generous one--
who being pleased by sacrifices, gifts, offerings, and the like, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as by pious meditation, is in a position to bestow the different forms
of enjoyment in this and the heavenly world, and Release which consists
in attaining to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> like his own. For action which is non-
intelligent and transitory is incapable of bringing about a result
connected with a future time.




38. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural declaration.

That he bestows all rewards--whether in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of enjoyment or Release--
Scripture also declares 'This indeed is the great, the unborn Self, the
eater of food, the giver of wealth' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 24); and 'For he
alone causes delight' (Taitt. Up. II, 7).--Next a primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is
stated.




39. For the same reasons Jaimini (thinks it to be) religious action.

For the same reasons, viz. possibility and scriptural declaration, the
teacher Jaimini thinks that religious works, viz. sacrifices, gifts,
offerings, and meditation, of themselves <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about their rewards. For
we observe that in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> actions such as ploughing and the like,
and charitable gifts and so on, <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about their own reward, directly
or indirectly. And although Vedic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> do not <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about their rewards
immediately, they may do so mediately, viz. by means of the so-called
_apûrva_. This follows also from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Vedic injunctions, such
as 'He who is desirous of the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to sacrifice.' As such
injunctions enjoin sacrifices as the means of bringing about the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
desired to be realised, viz. the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the like, there is
no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> than to assume that the result (which is seen not to
spring directly from the sacrifice) is accomplished by the mediation of
the apûrva.




40. But the former, Bâdarâyana (thinks), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the designation
(of deities) as the cause.

The reverend Bâdarâyana maintains the previously declared awarding of
rewards by the Supreme <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> since the scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> referring to
the different sacrifices declare that the deities only, Agni, Vâyu, and
so on, who are propitiated by the sacrifices--which are nothing else but
means to propitiate deities--are the cause of the rewards attached to
the sacrifices. Compare <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Let him who is desirous of
prosperity offer a white animal to Vâyu. For Vâyu is the swiftest god.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> approaches Vâyu with his proper share, and Vâyu leads him
to prosperity.' And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> instruction which the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> give, as to
the means by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> desirous of certain results are to effect those
results, is required on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the injunctions only, and hence it
cannot be doubted that it has reference to the injunctions. The
apparatus of means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the results <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being learnt from the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> only, no <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> acquainted with the force of the means of proof
will assent to that apparatus, as stated by the text, being <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside
and an apûrva about which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says nothing being fancifully assumed.
And that the imperative verbal forms of the injunctions denote as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be effected by the effort of the sacrificer, only that which on
the basis of the usage of language and grammatical science is recognised
as the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the root-element of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> as 'yajeta,' viz. the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (yâga), which consists in the propitiation of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> being,
and not some additional supersensuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> such as the apûrva, we have
already proved above (p. 153 ff.). <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'Vâyu is the swiftest
god' teach that Vâyu and other deities are the bestowers of rewards. And
that it is fundamentally the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self--as constituting the inner
Self of Vâyu and other deities--which is pleased by offerings, and
bestows rewards for them is declared by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Offerings and
pious works, all this he bears who is the nave of the Universe. He is
<span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and Vâyu, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> and Moon' (Mahânâr. Up. I, 6, 7). Similarly in
the antaryâmin-brâhmana, 'He who dwells in Vâyu, of whom Vâyu is the
body'; 'He who dwells in Agni,' &c. Smriti expresses itself similarly,
'Whatsoever devotee wishes to worship with <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> whatsoever <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> form,
of him do I make that <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> unshakable. Endued with such <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> he
endeavours to propitiate him and obtains from him his desires--those
indeed being ordained by me' (Bha. Gî. VII, 21-22); 'For I am the
enjoyer and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of all sacrifices' (IX, 24)--where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> means him
who bestows the reward for the sacrifices. 'To the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> go the
worshippers of the gods, and those devoted to me go to me' (VII, 23). In
ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> men, by agriculture and the like, acquire wealth in
various forms, and by means of this propitiate their king, either
directly or through his officials and servants; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> thereupon
is seen to reward them in a manner corresponding to the measure of their
services and presents. The Vedânta-texts, on the other hand, give
instruction on a subject which transcends the sphere of all the other
means of knowledge, viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all shadow
even of imperfection, and a treasure-house as it were of all exalted

oblations, which are helpful towards the propitiation of that Person; on
praise, worship, and meditation, which directly propitiate him; and on
the rewards which he, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> propitiated, bestows, viz. temporal happiness
and final Release.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'reward.'




<span class="t7 hoverable">THIRD</span> PÂDA.

1. What is understood from all the Vedânta-texts (is one), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the non-difference of injunction and the rest.

The Sûtras have stated whatever has to be stated to the end of rousing
the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of meditation-concluding with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> bestows
rewards. Next the question is introduced <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the vidyâs (i.e. the
different forms of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which the Vedânta-texts enjoin)
are different or non-different, on the decision of which question it
will depend <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the qualities attributed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in those vidyâs
are to be comprised in one act of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> or not.--The first
subordinate question arising here is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> one and the same meditation--
as e.g. the vidyâ of Vaisvânara--which is met with in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of
several sâkhâs, constitutes one vidyâ or several.--The vidyâs are
separate, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the same <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
is, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> difference, imparted for a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> time, and moreover stands
under a different heading--both which circumstances necessarily attend
the text's being met with in different sâkhâs--proves the difference of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> meditations. It is for this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> only that a restrictive
injunction, such as the one conveyed in the text, 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> tell this
science of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to those only who have performed the rite of carrying
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> on their head' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 10)--which restricts the impaiting
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to the Âtharvanikas, to whom that rite is peculiar--has any
sense; for if the vidyâs were one, then the rite mentioned, which is a
part of the vidyâ, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be valid for the members of other sâkhâs also,
and then the restriction enjoined by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have no meaning.--
This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra, 'What is understood from all the
Vedânta-texts' is one and the same meditation, 'because there is non-
difference of injunction and the rest.' By injunction is meant the
injunction of special activities denoted by different verbal roots--such
as upâsîta 'he should meditate,' vidyât 'he should know.' The and the
rest' of the Sûtra is meant to comprise as additional reasons the
circumstances mentioned in the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ-sûtras (II, 4, 9). Owing to
all these circumstances, non-difference of injunction and the rest, the
same vidyâ is recognised in other sâkhâs also. In the Châandogya (V, 12,
2) as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the Vâjasaneyaka we meet with one and the same
injunction (viz. 'He should meditate on Vaisvânara'). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span>
(character, rûpa) of the meditations also is the same, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a
cognition solely depends on its object; and the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is in both cases
the same, viz. Vaisvânara. The name of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs also is the same,
viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Vaisvânara. And both vidyâs are declared to have
the same result, viz. attaining to Brahman. All these reasons establish
the identity of vidyâs even in different sâkhâs.--The next Sûtra refers
to the reasons <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth for his <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> by the Pûrvapakshin and refutes
them.




2. If it be said (that the vidyâs are not one) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference,
we deny this, since even in one (vidyâ there may be repetition).

If it be said that there is no oneness of vidyâ, because the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the
same <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> being stated again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> difference, and being met with in
a different chapter, proves the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of injunction to be different; we
reply that even in one and the same vidyâ some <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> may be repeated
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any change, and under a new heading (in a different chapter); if,
namely, there is difference of cognising subjects. Where the cognising
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is one only, repetition of the same <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> under a new heading
can only be explained as <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> difference of <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> enjoined, and
hence separation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs. But where the cognising persons are
different (and this of course is eminently so in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of different
sâkhâs), the double statement of one and the same <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> explains itself
as subserving the cognition of those different persons, and hence does
not imply difference of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> enjoined.--The next Sûtra refutes the
argument founded on a rite enjoined in the Mundaka.




3. For (the sirovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (that rite) being a heading in the samâkâra; and the
restriction is like that of the libations.

What the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says as to a restriction connected with the 'vow of the
head,' does not intimate a difference of vidyâs. For that vow does not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of the vidyâ. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of
the _study_ of the Veda on the part of the Âtharvanikas, being meant to
establish that they should possess that special qualification which the
rite produces; but it does not affect the vidyâ itself. This is proved
by the subsequent clause, 'a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has not performed that rite may not
_read_ the text,' which directly connects the rite with the studying of
the text. And it is further proved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of the
Âtharvanikas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'sâmâkara,' that rite is referred to as a rite
connected with the Veda (not with the special vidyâ <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the
Mundaka), viz. in the passage, 'this is explained already by the Veda-
observance' (which extends the details of the sirovrata, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
veda-vrata, to other observances). By the _knowledge of Brahman_
(referred to in the Mundaka-text 'let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> tell this science of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
to those only,' &c.), we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to understand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
Veda in general. And that restriction is 'like that of the
libations'--i. e. it is analogous to the restriction under which the
sava-libations, beginning with the Saptasûrya-libation, and terminating
with the Sataudana-libation, are offered in the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> which is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
by the followers of the Atharvan, and not in the ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fires.




4. Scripture also declares this.

Scripture also shows that (identical) <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is what all the Vedânta-
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> intimate. The Chândogya (VIII, 1, 1 ff.) declares that that which
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the small space in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is to be enquired into, and then
in reply to the question what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be enquired into is, says
that it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self possessing the eight attributes, freedom
from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and the rest, which is to be meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
heart. And then the Taittiriya-text, referring to this declaration in
the Chândogya, says, 'Therein is a small space, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all grief;
what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that is to be meditated upon' (Mahânâr. Up. X, 23), and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> likewise enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self possessing the
eight qualities. And this is possible only if, owing to unity of vidya,
the qualities mentioned in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> are included also in the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> enjoined in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> text.--Having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> established the
unity of meditations, the Sûtras proceed to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> the practical effect
of such unity.




5. (Meditation) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being equal, there is combination (of gunas); on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference of purport in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of what subserves
injunction.

The <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in all Vedânta-texts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being the same, the qualities
mentioned in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> are to be combined with those mentioned in another;
'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference of purport in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of what subserves
injunction.' We <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> that in connexion with certain injunctions of
meditation--such as the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Vaisvânara, or the small ether
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of some individual Vedânta-book mentions
certain secondary matters (qualities, guna) which subserve that
meditation; and as these gunas are connected with the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> they
are to be comprised in it, so that they may accomplish their aim, i.e.
of subserving the meditation. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> we have to
enclose in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> gunas mentioned in other Vedânta-texts; for
being also connected with the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> they subserve it in the same
way.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'what is intimated by all
Vedânta-texts.




6. If it be said that there is difference on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the text; we say
no; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference.

So far it has been shown that the non-difference of injunction, and so
on, establishes the unity of meditations, and that owing to the latter
the special features of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> enjoined in different <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> have to
be combined. Next, an enquiry is entered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
certain particular meditations there actually exists, or not, that non-
difference of injunction which is the cause of meditations being
recognised as identical. A <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Udgîtha is enjoined in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Chandogas, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in that of the Vâjasaneyins (Ch. Up. I,
2; Bri. Up. I, 3); and the question arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are to be
viewed as one <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> or not. The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former
alternative. For, he says, there is no difference of injunction, and so
on, since both <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoin as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> the Udgîtha
viewed under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Prâna; since there is the same reward promised
in both places, viz. mastering of one's enemies; since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is the same, the Udgîtha being in both cases viewed under the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Prâna; since the injunction is the same, being conveyed in both
cases by the same verbal root (vid, to know); and since both meditations
have the same technical name, viz. udgîtha-vidyâ. The Sûtra states this
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the refutation of an objection raised by the
advocate of the final view. We do not admit, the objector says, the
unity maintained by you, since the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> clearly show a difference of
form. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Vâjasaneyins represents as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> that which is the agent in the act of singing out the Udgîtha;
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Chandogas enjoins <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on what is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span>
of the action of singing out (i. e. the Udgîtha itself). This
discrepancy establishes difference in the character of the meditation,
and as this implies difference of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> enjoined, the mere non-
difference of injunction, and so on, is of no force, and hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
meditations are separate ones.--This objection the Pûrvapakshin impugns,
'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference.' For both texts, at the outset, declare
that the Udgîtha is the means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the conquest of enemies
(Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices by means of the Udgîtha'
(Bri. Up.); 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the Udgîtha, thinking they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> with that
overcome the Asuras'--Ch. Up.). In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> not to stultify this
common beginning, we must assume that in the clause 'For them that
breath sang out' (Bri. Up.), the Udgîtha, which really is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
the action of singing, is spoken of as the agent. Otherwise the term
udgîtha in the introductory <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> ('by means of the Udgîtha') <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
have to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as by implication denoting the agent (while directly it
indicates the instrument).--Hence there is oneness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs.--
Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra disposes.




7. Or not, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of difference of subject-matter; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
the attribute of being <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the high, and so on.

There is no unity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs, since the subject-matter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
differs. For the tale in the Chândogya-text, which begins 'when the
Devas and the Asuras struggled together,' connects itself with the
pranava (the syllable Om) which is introduced as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in Chánd. I, 1, 1, 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the syllable Om as
the Udgîtha'; and the clause forming part of the tale,'they meditated on
that chief breath as Udgîtha.' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> refers to a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
pranava which is a part only of the Udgîtha. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Vâja-
saneyins; on the other hand, there is nothing to correspond to the
introductory <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which in the Chândogya-text determines the subject-
matter, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> clearly states that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> refers to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> Udgîtha (not only the pranava). And this difference of leading
subject-matter implies difference of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> enjoined, and this again
difference of the character of meditation, and hence there is no unity
of vidyâs. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> for the Chandogas is the
pranava viewed under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Prâna; while for the Vâjasaneyins it is
the Udgâtri (who sings the Udgîtha), imaginatively identified with Prâna.
Nor does there arise, on this latter account, a contradiction between
the later and the earlier part of the story of the Vâjasaneyins. For as
a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Udgâtri necessarily extends to the Udgîtha, which is
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the activity of singing, the latter also helps to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
about the result, viz. the mastering of enemies.--There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> no unity
of vidyâ, although there may be non-difference of injunction, and so on.--
'As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the attribute of being <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the high,' &c. In
one and the same sâkhâ there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> meditations, in each of which the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is enjoined to be viewed under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the pranava (Ch.
Up. I, 6; I, 9), and in so far the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs are alike. But while the
former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins that the pranava has to be viewed under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
a golden man, in the latter he has to be viewed as possessing the
attributes of being <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the high, and owing to this difference
of attributes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> meditations must be held separate (a_ fortiori_,
then, those meditations are separate which have different objects of
meditation).




8. If that be declared on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of name; (we object, since) that is
also (where the objects of injunction differ).

If the oneness of the vidyâs be maintained on the ground that both have
the same name, viz. udgîtha-vidyâ, we point out that oneness is found
also where the objects enjoined are different. The term agnihotra is
applied equally to the permanent agnihotra and to that agnihotra which
forms part of the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> 'Kundapâyinâm ayanam'; and the term
udgîtha is applied equally to the many different meditations described
in the first prapâthaka of the Chândogya.




9. And (this is) appropriate, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the extension.

Since the pranava, which is a part of the udgîtha, is introduced as the
subject of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in the first prapâthaka of the Chândogya, and
extends over the later vidyâs also, it is appropriate to assume that
also in the clause 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the udgîtha'--which stands in the
middle--the term udgîtha denotes the pranava. Expressions such as 'the
cloth is burned' show that frequently the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> denotes the part.--The
conclusion from all this is that in the Chândogya the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is constituted by the pranava--there termed udgîtha--viewed
under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of prâna; while in the Vâjasaneyaka the term udgîtha
denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> udgîtha, and the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is he who
produces the udgîtha, i.e. the udgâtri, viewed under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of prâna.
And this proves that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs are separate.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'difference.'




10. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.

The Chândogya and the Vajasaneyaka alike record a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Prana;
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> being Prana as possessing the qualities of
being the oldest and the best, and also as possessing certain other
qualities such as being the richest, and so on (Ch. Up. V, 1; Bri. Up.
VI, 1). In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Kaushîtakins, on the other hand, there is a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Prâna which mentions the former qualities ('being the
best' and 'being the oldest'), but not the latter ('being the richest,'
and so on). This, the Pûrvapakshin maintains, constitutes a difference
between the objects of meditation, and hence between the meditations
themselves.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-
difference of everything, those elsewhere.' There is no difference of
meditation. Those qualities, viz. being the richest, and so on, are to
be meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> in the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> also, viz. in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
Prâna of the Kaushîtakins; 'since there is non-difference of everything,'
i.e. since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Kaushîtakins also exhibits the very same
method, in all its details, for proving what it is undertaken to prove,
viz. that Prâna is the oldest and best. And for that proof it is
required that Prâna should be viewed as possessing also the quality of
being the richest, and so on, and these qualities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have to be
comprised in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of the Kaushîtakins also. Hence there is no
difference of meditation.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'non-
difference of everything.'

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Prâna as the oldest and best cannot
be accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Prâna being also meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> as the richest,
and so on, and as hence these latter qualities have to be comprised in
the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Prâna of the Kaushîtakins, although they are not
expressly mentioned there; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> those qualities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
which the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be accomplished, must be included
in all meditations on Brahman--this is the point to be proved next.




11. Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the
qualities.

The point to be decided here is whether, or not, the essential qualities
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> are to be included in all meditations on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman.--
Since there is no valid <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for including in a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> those
qualities which are not expressly mentioned in the section containing
that meditation, only those qualities which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> expressly mentioned
should be included!--This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is negatived by the Sûtra.
The clause, 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-difference,' has to be carried on from
the preceding Sûtra. As the 'subject of the qualities,' i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
the same in all meditations, the qualities which do not exist apart from
their subject, viz. bliss, and so on, are to be comprised in all
meditations.--But for the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> then such qualities as 'having joy
for its head' (Taitt. Up. II, 5) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also have to be included in all
meditations on Brahman!--This the next Sûtra negatives.




12. Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not
established, for if there were difference (of members) there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
increase and decrease.

The declaration that the essential qualities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> are established
for all meditations, does not imply that such attributes as 'having joy
for its head' are equally established. For the latter are not qualities
of Brahman, since they are mere elements in a figurative representation
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of an animal body. Otherwise, i.e. if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
really possessed different members, such as head, wings, and so on, it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be liable to increase and decrease, and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be in conflict
with <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman.'--But if
this reasoning holds good, then all the infinite qualities belonging to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> such as lordly power, generosity, compassion, and so on--all of
which are incapable of existing apart from the subject to which they
belong-would have to be comprehended in all those meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
where they are not expressly mentioned; and this could not possibly be
done, as those qualities are infinite in number.--This difficulty the
next Sûtra removes.




13. But the others, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of equality with the thing.

Those other qualities which are 'equal to the thing,' i. e. which are
attributes determining the essential character of the thing, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> necessarily entering into the idea of the thing, must be
included in all meditations, no less than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> itself. To this
class belong qualities such as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> being, knowledge, bliss, purity,
infinity, and so on. For of Brahman--which by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'that from
which all these beings,' &c. had been suggested as the cause of the
world--the essential definition is given in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'the True,
knowledge, infinite is Brahman'; 'bliss is Brahman,' and others; and
hence, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> notion may be formed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation, such qualities as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> being, bliss, and so on,
have to be included in all meditations on Brahman. Such additional
qualities, on the other hand, as e.g. compassion, which indeed cannot
exist apart from the subject to which they belong, but are not necessary
elements of the idea of Brahman, are to be included in those meditations
only where they are specially mentioned.

But, an objection is raised, if 'having joy for its head' and the like
are not qualities of Brahman, but merely serve the purpose of a
figurative representation of Brahman, for what purpose then is this
representation introduced? For if something is represented as something
else, there must be some motive for doing so. Where, e.g. the sacred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> compares the meditating devotee to a charioteer, its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and
organs to a chariot, and so on, it does so for the purpose of assisting
the subjection to the Self of the means of meditation, i.e. the body,
the senses, and so on. But in the present <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> no such purpose is to be
discerned, and hence it must needs be admitted that having joy for its
head, and so on, are real qualities of Brahman.--The next Sûtra disposes
of this difficulty.




14. For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose.

As no other purpose can be assigned, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> must be supposed to
represent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as having joy for its head, and so on, for the purpose
of meditation. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to accomplish the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is
enjoined in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'he who knows (i.e. meditates on) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches
the Highest,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> represents the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> consisting of bliss as
made up of joy, satisfaction, &c., and compares these to the head, the
wings, and so on. The Self of bliss, which is the inmost of all the
Selfs mentioned in the text, is by this means represented to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in
a definite shape; just as in the preceding sections the Self of food,
the Self of breath, and the rest had similarly been represented in
definite shapes, consisting of head, wings, and so on. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the
qualities of having joy for its head, &c. are merely secondary marks of
the Self of bliss, they are not necessarily included in each <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
that involves the idea of that Self.




15. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the term 'Self.'

That this is so further follows from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that in the clause
'different from this is the inner Self consisting of bliss' the term
'Self is used. For as the Self cannot really possess a head, wings, and
tail, its having joy for its head, and so on, can only be meant in a
metaphorical sense, for the sake of easier comprehension.--But, in the
preceding sections, the term _Self_ had been applied to what is _not_ of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Self--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> speaking of the Self of breath, the Self of
mind, and so on; how then are we able to determine that in the phrase
'the Self of bliss' the term Self denotes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> _Self_?--To this the
next Sûtra replies.




16. There is reference to the Self, as in other places; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the subsequent passage.

In the clause,'different from that is the Self of bliss,' the term Self
can refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only; 'as in other cases,' i.e. as in
other passages--'the Self only was this in the beginning; it thought,
let me send forth the worlds,' and similar ones--the term 'Self denotes
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only.--But whereby is this proved?--'By the subsequent
passagel, i.e. by the passage, 'he desired, may I be many, may I grow
forth,'--which refers to the Self of bliss.




17. If it be said 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of connexion'; it may be so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
ascertainment.

But as in the preceding sections the term Self is seen to be connected
with what is not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self, such as the Self of breath,
and so on, it is not possible to draw a valid conclusion from the
subsequent passage!--It _is_ possible, the Sûtra replies, 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
ascertainment.' For the previous clause, 'from that Self there
originated the Ether,' settles in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
and that idea then is transferred in succession to the (so-called) Self
of breath, the Self of mind, and so on, until it finally finds rest in
the Self of bliss, beyond which there is no other Self; while at the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the subsequent clause 'he desired' confirms the idea of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The term Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> connects itself from the beginning with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Selfs, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is as it were
viewed in them.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'bliss and the rest.'




18. The new (thing is enjoined); on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the statement of what has
to be done.

The Sûtra discusses an additional question connected with the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
on breath. Both texts--the Chândogya as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Vâjasaneyaka-declare
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> constitutes a dress for prana, and refer to the rinsing of
the mouth with water. The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> what the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> mean
to enjoin is the rinsing of the mouth, or a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on prâna as
having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> for its dress.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains the former view;
for, he says, the Vâjasaneyaka uses the injunctive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> 'he is to rinse,'
while there is no injunctive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> referring to the meditation; and
what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says in praise of the breath <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> not being allowed to
remain naked may be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as a mere glorification of the act of rinsing.
And as ordinary rinsing of the mouth, subsequent to eating, is already
established by Smriti and custom, we must conclude that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> means
to enjoin rinsing of the mouth of a different kind, viz. as auxiliary to
the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on prâna.--To this the Sûtra replies that what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
enjoins is the new' thing, i.e. the previously non-established
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> as forming the dress of prâna. 'On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
statement of what has to be done,' i.e. on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the statement of
what is not established--for only on the latter condition Scripture has
a meaning. The beginning as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the end of the Vâjasaneyaka-text
clearly refers to a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for rinsing as forming
a dress for prâna; and as rinsing is already established by Smriti and
custom, we naturally infer that what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins is a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
breath as having the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in rinsing for its dress. This also
explains why the Chândogya-text does not mention the rinsing at all, but
merely the clothing of breath with water.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'the statement of what has to be done.'

In the Taittiriyaka and in the khilas of the Rânâyanîyas we have the
following passage: 'Gathered <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> are the powers among which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

ancient powers, that it pervades the sky, and so on. And as these
attributes are not stated in connexion with any special meditation, we
must infer that they are to be included in all meditations whatever on
Brahman.--This primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is controverted by the Sûtra. The
holding <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> of all powers, &c., although not mentioned in connexion
with any special meditation, is not to be included in all meditations
whatever, but to be connected with particular meditations 'on the same
ground,' i.e. according to difference of place. _Where_ those qualities
have to be included must be decided on the ground of feasibility. The
attribute of pervading the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> cannot be included in a

the Chândogya <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is an independent one, and has for its reward

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Âtharvanikas exhibits at the beginning of their
Upanishad some mantras, 'Pierce the sukra, pierce the heart.' The
followers of the Sâma-veda read at the beginning of their rahasya-
brâhmana 'O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Savitri, promote the sacrifice.' The Kâthakas and the
Taittirîyakas have 'May Mitra be propitious to us, may Varuna be
propitious.' The Sâtyâyanins have 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> a white horse, a tawny and a
black one!' The Kaushîtakins have a Brâhmana referring to the Mahavrata-
ceremony, 'Indra having slain Vritra became great.' The Kaushîtakins
also have a Mahâvrata-brâhmana. 'Prajâpati is the year; his Self is that
Mahâvrata.' The Vâjasaneyins have a Brâhmana referring to the Pravargya,
'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> sat down for a sattra-celebration.' With reference to all this
a doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> these mantras and the sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> referred
to in the Brâhmana <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> parts of the meditations enjoined in the
Upanishads or not.--The Pûrvapakshin affirms this, on the ground that as
the mantras and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are mentioned in the immediate neighbourhood of
the meditations the idea of their forming parts of the latter naturally
presents itself. Such mantras as 'pierce the heart' and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> such as
the pravargya may indeed--on the basis of direct statement (sruti),
inferential mark (linga), and syntactical connexion (vâkya), which are
stronger than mere proximity--be understood to be connected with certain
actions; but, on the other hand, mantras such as 'May Varuna be
propitious' have no application elsewhere, and are suitable
introductions to meditations. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> them to be parts of the
meditations, and hence hold that those mantras are to be included in all
meditations.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the
difference of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of piercing, and so on.' The inferential marks
contained in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'pierce the sukra, pierce the heart'; 'I
shall <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the right, I shall <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the true,' show that the mantras
have an application in connexion with certain magical practices, or else
the study of the Veda, and the like, and do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of
meditations. That is to say--in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the mantra 'pierce the
heart' enables us to infer that also the mantra 'pierce the sukra'
belongs to some magical rite, so we infer from the special <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of
mantras such as 'I shall <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> the right,' &c., that also mantras such
as 'May Mitra be propitious' are connected with the study of the Veda,
and do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of meditations. That mantras of this kind
and Brâhmana passages relative to the Pravargya and the like are placed
at the beginning of Upanishads is owing to their having, like the latter,
to be studied in the forest.--Herewith terminates the adhikarana of
'piercing and the like.'




26. But in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the getting rid of (it has to be combined with
the obtaining), as it is supplementary to statements of obtaining; as in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the kusas, the metres, the praise, and the singing. This has
been explained.

The Chandogas read in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Shaking off all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> as a horse shakes

Âtharvanikas have 'He who knows, shaking off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from

The Kaushîtakins 'He shakes off his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds.
His beloved relatives obtain the good, his unbeloved relatives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

part of him who knows, of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> works; one mentions only the
obtainment of these works, on the part of friends and enemies; and one
mentions both these occurrences.--Now both the occurrences, although
mentioned in several meditations, must be considered elements of all
meditations: for whoever, on the basis of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman,

between the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the abandonment of works, and that on the
obtainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> by others, and that on both these events; or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
in each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> all these meditations are to be combined.--There is option,
the Pûrvapakshin holds; for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> make different
declarations on this point. For, if the meditations had to be combined,
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be in each <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on both the matters mentioned;
and as such double <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is established by the Kaushitakin text, it

be to allow option. Nor must this conclusion be controverted on the
ground that declarations of the same matter, made in different places,
are made with reference to the difference of students severally reading
the several texts; for this holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in those cases only where

their passing over to other persons. Nor can you <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the
difference of statement on the ground of difference of vidyâs; for you
yourself maintain that the meditations in question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of all
meditations.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra impugns, 'but where the getting rid of
is mentioned,' &c. Where a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> mentions either the abandonment only of

necessarily be combined, since the statement as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> being
obtained forms a supplement to the statement of their being abandoned.
For the former statement declares the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
works, got rid of by him who knows Brahman, are transferred.--This
supplementary relation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> statements the Sûtra illustrates by some
parallel cases. A clause in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Sâtyâyanins, 'the kusas are

more general statement in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Kaushîtakins, 'the kusas are

The clause, 'the metres of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are prior,'

forms a supplement to those texts. Analogous is the relation of the
clause, 'he assists the stotra of the shodasin when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> has half
risen,' to the less definite statement 'he assists with gold the stotra
of the shodasin;' and the relation of the clause, 'the adhvaryu is not
to sing,' to the general injunction 'all the priests join in the singing.'
Unless we admit that one statement, which defines some other more
general statement, may stand to the latter in a supplementary relation,
we are driven to assume an optional proceeding, and this is
objectionable as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as there is any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> open; according to a

the other hand, who are entrusted with certain offices, do not

32. There is no restriction (since) all (have to go on that path).
(Thus) there is non-contradiction of sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and Smriti.

The question here is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be reached on the path of the

the Upakosala-vidyâ, describe that path, or by all who practise any of
the meditations on Brahman. The Pûrvapakshin holds the former view,
since there is no proof to show that in other vidyâs the going on that
path is not mentioned, and since those other vidyâs-such as the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
'and those who in the forest meditate on <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and austerities,'and'
those who in the forest worship faith, the True' (Ch. Up. V, 10, 1; Bri.
Up. VI, 2, 15)--suggest to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman.
This the Sûtra negatives. There is no restriction to that limited class
of devotees, since all who carry on meditations have to go on that path.
For on this latter assumption only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and inference, i.e. scripture
and authoritative tradition, are not contradicted. As to scripture, the
Chândogya and the Vâjasaneyaka alike, in the Pañkâgni-vidyâ, declare
that all those who practise <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> go on that path. In the
Vâjasaneyaka the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'who know this' refer to those who practise the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the five fires, while the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'those who in
the forest meditate on <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and the True' refer to those who meditate
on Brahman; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> then goes on to say that all those devotees go
to Brahman, on the path of the gods. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'the True, knowledge,
infinite is Brahman,' and 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> must be enquired into,' prove that
the term 'the True' denotes Brahman; and as in the Chândogya the term
'tapas' occurs in the corresponding place, we conclude that both these
terms, viz. _the True_ and tapas, denote nothing else but Brahman.
<span class="t25 hoverable">Meditation</span> on Brahman, preceded by faith, is mentioned elsewhere also;
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which begins 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> must be enquired into' we read
further on 'Faith must be enquired into' (Ch. Up. VII, 18, 16; 19).
Smriti also declares that all those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> proceed on the path
of the gods, 'Fire, the light, the day, the bright fortnight, the six
months of the sun's northern progress--proceeding by that road those who
know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> go to Brahman' (Bha. Gî. VIII, 24). And there are many
other Sruti and Smriti passages of this kind. The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
is that the Upakosalavidyâ and similar <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> merely refer to that going
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is common to all vidyâs.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'non-restriction.'




33. But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised (in all
meditations). There being equality (of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to be meditated on)
and (those conceptions) existing (in Brahman); as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of what
belongs to the upasad. This has been explained.

We read in the Brihad-âranyaka (III, 8, 9),'O Gârgî, the Brâhmanas <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span>
that the Akshara. It is neither coarse nor fine,' and so on. And in the
Atharvana (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5) we have 'The <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is that by
which the Akshara is apprehended. That which cannot be seen nor seized,'
&c. The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> all the qualities there predicated of
Brahman--called akshara, i.e. the Imperishable--and constituting
something contrary in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to the apparent world, are to be included
in all meditations on Brahman, or only those where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> specially
mentions them. The Pûrvapakshin advocates the latter view; for, he says,
there is no authority for holding that the qualities which characterise
one <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> are characteristic of other meditations also; and such
negative attributes as are mentioned in those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not--as
positive qualities such as bliss do--contribute to the apprehension of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman. What those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do is merely to deny of
Brahman, previously apprehended as having bliss, and so on, for its
essential qualities, certain qualities belonging to the empirical world,
such as grossness, and so on; for all negation must refer to an
established basis.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra refutes. The ideas of absence of
grossness, and so on, which are connected with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> viewed as the
Akshara, are to be included in all meditations on Brahman. For the
imperishable (akshara) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the same in all meditations, and
qualities such as non-grossness enter into the conception of its
essential nature. The apprehension of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> means the apprehension of
its specific character. But mere bliss, and so on, does not suggest the
specific character of Brahman, since those qualities belong also to the
individual soul. What is specifically characteristic of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is bliss,
and so on, in so far as fundamentally opposed to all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and
imperfection. The individual soul, on the other hand, although
fundamentally <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from evil, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> is capable of connexion with evil. Now
being fundamentally opposed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> implies having a character the
opposite of grossness and all similar qualities which belong to the
empirical world, material and mental. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> who thinks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
must think of it as having for its essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> bliss, knowledge,
and so on, in so far as distinguished by absence of grossness and the
like, and those qualities, being no less essential than bliss, and so on,
must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be included in all meditations on Brahman.--The Sûtra
gives an instance illustrating the principle that qualities (secondary
matters) follow the principal <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> to which they belong. As the mantra
'Agnir vai hotram vetu,' although given in the Sâma-veda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> has to be
recited in the Yajur-veda style, with a subdued voice, because it stands
in a subordinate relation to the upasad-offerings prescribed for the
four-days 'sacrifice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Jamadagnya; those offerings are the
principal <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> to which the subordinate matter--the mantra--has to
conform. This point is explained in the first section, i.e. in the Pûrva
Mîmâmsâ-sûtras III, 3, 9.--But this being admitted, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow that
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the principal <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in all meditations on Brahman, and
secondary matters have to follow the principal matter, also such
qualities as 'doing all works, enjoying all odours and the like,' which
are mentioned in connexion with special meditations only, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
indiscriminately have to be included in all meditations.--With reference
to this the next Sûtra says.




34. So much; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of reflection.

Only so much, i.e. only those qualities which have to be included in all
meditations on Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which the essential special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

characterised by absence of grossness and the like. Other qualities,
such as doing all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> and the like, although indeed following their
substrate, are explicitly to be meditated on in special meditations only.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the idea of the Imperishable.'




35. Should it be said that (the former reply refers) to that Self to
which the aggregate of material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> belongs (since) otherwise the
difference (of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> replies) could not be accounted for; we say--no;
as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of instruction

In the Brihad-aranyaka (III, 4; 5) the same question is asked twice in
succession ('Tell me the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is visible, not invisible, the
Self who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> all'), while Yâjñavalkya gives a different answer to
each ('He who breathes in the upbreathing,' &c.; 'He who overcomes
hunger and thirst,' &c.). The question here is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
meditations, suggested by these sections, are different or not. They are
different, since the difference of reply effects a distinction between
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs. The former reply declares him who is the maker of
breathing forth, and so on to be the inner Self of all; the latter
describes him as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from hunger, thirst, and so on. It thence appears
that the former <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> refers to the inner (individual) Self which is
different from body, sense-organs, internal organ and vital breath;
while the latter refers to that which again differs from the inner Self,
viz. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from hunger, thirst, and so on. As the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is inside the aggregate of material things, it may be
spoken of as being that inner Self of all. Although this kind of
inwardness is indeed only a relative one, we nevertheless must accept it
in this place; for if, desirous of taking this 'being the inner Self of
all' in its literal sense, we assumed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self to be meant, the
difference of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> replies could not be accounted for. The former
reply evidently refers to the individual soul, since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
cannot be conceived as breathing forth, and so on; and the latter reply,
which declares the Self to be raised above hunger, &c., evidently refers
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. This is expressed in the earlier part of the Sûtra:
'The former reply refers to the Self to which there belongs the
aggregate of material things, i.e. the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as being the
inner Self of all; otherwise we could not <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> for the difference of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> replies.'--The last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Sûtra negative this--'not so,'
i.e. there is no difference of vidyâs, since both assertions and replies
refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self. The question says in both places, 'the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is visible, not invisible, the Self who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> all,'
and this clearly refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only. We indeed observe that
in some places the term _Brahman_ is, in a derived sense, applied to the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> under discussion, for distinction's
sake, adds the qualification 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is manifest' (sâkshât).
The quality of 'aparokshatva' (i.e. being that which does not transcend
the senses but lies openly revealed) also, which implies being connected
with all space and all time, suits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only, which from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such
as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' is known to be infinite.
In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the attribute of being the inner Self of all can belong
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, which <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'He who dwelling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
the earth,' &c., declare to be the inner ruler of the universe. The
replies to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> questions likewise can refer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only. The
unconditional causal agency with regard to breath, declared in the
clause 'he who breathes in the upbreathing,' &c., can belong to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, not to the individual soul, since the latter
possesses no such causal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> when in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep. Ushasta
thereupon, being not fully enlightened, since causality with regard to
breathing may in a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> be attributed to the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also,
again asks a question, in reply to which Yâjñavalkya clearly indicates
Brahman, 'Thou mayest not see the seer of sight,' &c., i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> must
not think that my previous speech has named as the causal agent of
breathing the individual soul, which is the causal agent with regard to
those activities which depend on the sense-organs, viz. seeing, hearing,
thinking, and knowing; for in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of deep sleep, swoon, and so on,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> possesses no such power. And moreover another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> also--'Who
could breathe if that bliss existed not in the ether?' (Taitt. Up. II,
7)--declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only is the cause of the breathing of
all living beings. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the answer to the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> question can
refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self only, which alone can be said to be raised
above hunger, thirst, and so on. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also both replies wind
up with the same phrase, 'Everything else is of evil.' The iteration of
question and reply serves the purpose of showing that the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the cause of all breathing is beyond all hunger, thirst,
and so on.--The Sûtra subjoins a parallel instance. 'As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
instruction.' As in the vidyâ of that which truly is (Ch. Up. VI, 1 ff.),
question and reply are iterated several times, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the
various greatness and <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of Brahman.--Thus the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sections under
discussion are of the same nature, in so far as setting forth that the
one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the inner Self of all is the cause of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
raised beyond all imperfections; and hence they constitute one
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only.--To this a new objection is raised. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sections
may indeed both refer to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman; nevertheless there is a
difference of meditation, as according to the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be

raised above all defects; this difference of character distinguishes the

first question being asked by Ushasta, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> by Kahola.




36. There is interchange (of ideas), for the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> distinguish; as in
other cases.

There is no difference of vidyâ because both questions and answers have
one subject-matter, and because the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that possesses enjoining

Both questions have for
their topic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> viewed as the inner Self of all; and in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span>

&c., proves that the question of Kahola has for its subject the Brahman,
to the qualities of which the question of Ushasta had referred. Both
answers again refer to the one Brahman, viewed as the Self of all. The
idea of the injunction of the entire <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> again is suggested in
the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> section only, 'Therefore a Brahmana, after he has done with
learning, is to wish to stand by real strength.' The <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> ascertained to be one, there must be effected a
mutual interchange of the ideas of Ushasta and Kahola, i.e. Ushasta's
conception of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being the cause of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must be entertained by
the interrogating Kahola also; and vice versa the conception of Kahola
as to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being beyond hunger, thirst, and so on, must be
entertained by Ushasta also. This interchange being made, the difference
of Brahman, the inner Self of all, from the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
determined by both sections. For this is the very <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
Yâjñavalkya's replies: in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to intimate that the inner Self of all
is different from the individual soul, they distinguish that Self as the
cause of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and as raised above hunger, thirst, and so on. Hence
Brahman's being the inner Self of all is the only quality that is the
subject of meditation; that it is the cause of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and so on are only
means to prove its being such, and are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to be meditated on
independently.--But if this is so, to what end must there be made an
interchange, on the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> interrogators, of their respective
ideas?--Brahman having, on the ground of being the cause of all life,
been ascertained by Ushasta as the inner Self of all, and different from
the individual soul, Kahola renews the question, thinking that the inner
Self of all must be viewed as different from the soul, on the ground of
some special attribute which cannot possibly belong to the soul; and
Yâjñavalkya divining his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> thereon declares that the inner Self
possesses an attribute which cannot possibly belong to the soul, viz.
being in essential opposition to all imperfection. The interchange of
ideas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> has to be made for the purpose of establishing the idea
of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation.--'As elsewhere,' i.
e. as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of that which truly is, the repeated
questions and replies only serve to define one and the same Brahman, not
to convey the idea of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> having to be meditated on
under new aspects.--But a new objection is raised--As there is, in the
Sad-vidyâ also, a difference between the several questions and answers,
how is that vidyâ known to be one?--To this question the next Sûtra
replies.




37. For one and the same (highest divinity), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the 'truly being,'
and so on (is the subject of that meditation).

For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> divinity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> there _that which is_--which was
introduced in the clause 'that divinity thought,' &c.--is intimated by
all the following sections of that chapter. This is proved by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
that the attributes--'that_ which truly _is' and so on--which were
mentioned in the first section and confirmed in the subsequent ones, are
finally summed up in the statement, 'in that all this has its Self, that
is the True, that is the Self.'

Some interpreters construe the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras as constituting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
adhikaranas. The former Sûtra, they say, teaches that the text, 'I am
thou, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> I,' enjoins a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
as interchangeable. But as on the basis of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'All this is
indeed Brahman,' 'all this has its Self in Brahman,' 'Thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that,'
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted is as a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> of course understood to mean that there
is one universal Self, the teaching which it is by those interpreters
assumed to convey <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be nothing new; and their interpretation

individual and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self will moreover be discussed under IV, I,
3. Moreover, there is no foundation for a special <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Self of all being one.--The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> Sûtra, they say,
declares the oneness of the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> enjoined in the text,

(_Bri_. Up. V, 4), and of the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> enjoined in the subsequent
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (V, 5. 2), 'Now what is true, that is the Âditya, the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
that dwells in yonder orb, and the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in the right eye.' But this
also is untenable. For the difference of abode mentioned in the latter
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> (viz. the abode in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and in the eye) establishes difference
of vidyâ, as already shown under Sû. III, 3, 21. Nor is it possible to
assume that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> meditations comprised in the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which have
a character of their own in so far as they <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> as embodied in
syllables, and so on, and which are declared to be connected with a
special result ('he who knows this destroys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and leaves it'), should
be identical with the one earlier <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> which has an independent
character of its own and a result of its own ('he conquers these
worlds'). Nor can it be said that the declaration of a fruit in 'he
destroys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and leaves it' refers merely to the fruit (not of the
entire <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> but) of a subordinate part of the meditation; for
there is nothing to prove this. The proof certainly cannot be said to
lie in the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the vidyâs being one; for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply reasoning
in a circle, viz. as follows--it being settled that the vidyâs are one,
it follows that the fruit of the former <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only is the main one,
while the fruits of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later meditations are subordinate ones; and--
it being settled that those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later fruits are subordinate ones, it
follows that, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> there is no difference depending on connexion with
fruits, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later meditations are one with the preceding one.--All
this proves that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sûtras can be interpreted only in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
maintained by us.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'being within.'




38. Wishes and the rest, here and there; (as is known from the abode,
and so on).

We read in the Chândogya (VIII, I, 1), 'There is that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Brahman,
and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether,' &c.;
and in the Vâjasaneyaka, 'He is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> unborn Self who consists of
knowledge,' and so on. A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
constitute one <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> or not.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> meditations are separate, the
Pûrvapakshin maintains; for they have different characters. The
Chândogya represents as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> the ether as
distinguished by eight different attributes, viz. freedom from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
and the rest; while, according to the Vâjasaneyaka, the being to be
meditated on is he who dwells <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that ether, and is distinguished by
attributes such as lordship, and so on.--To this we reply that the
meditations are not distinct, since there is no difference of character.
For desires and so on constitute that character 'here and there,' i.e.
in both <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> nothing else but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> distinguished by attributes, such
as having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> wishes, and so on, forms the subject of meditation. This
is known 'from the abode and so on,' i.e. the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is recognised
as the same because in both <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is referred to as abiding in
the heart, being a bridge, and so on. Lordship and the rest, which are
stated in the Vâjasaneyaka, are special aspects of the quality of being
capable to realise all one's purposes, which is one of the eight
qualities declared in the Chândogya, and as such prove that all the
attributes going <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with that quality in the Chândogya are valid
for the Vâjasaneyaka also. The character of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vidyâs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
does not differ. The connexion with a reward also does not differ, for
it consists in both cases in attaining to Brahman; cp. Ch. Up. VIII, 12,
3 'Having approached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> he is manifested in his own form,'
and Bri. Up. V, 4, 24 'He becomes indeed the fearless Brahman.' That,
in the Chândogya-text, the term _ether_ denotes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, has
already been determined under I, 3, 14. As in the Vâjasaneyaka, on the
other hand, he who abides in the ether is recognised as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
we infer that by the ether in which he abides must be understood the
ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, which in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'within there is a little

maintained that the attributes mentioned in the Chândogya have to be
combined with those stated in the Vâjasaneyaka (lordship, rulership, &c.
), since even the latter are not truly valid for the meditation. For the
immediately preceding passage, 'By the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> it is to be perceived that

infer that the attributes of lordship and so on, no less than the
qualities of grossness and the like, have to be denied of Brahman. From
this again we infer that in the Chândogya also the attributes of
satyakâmatva and so on are not meant to be declared as Brahman's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to be omitted in meditations aiming at final release.--
This objection the next Sûtra disposes of.

its Self, and negatives the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of plurality--established antecedently
to Vedic teaching--as excluding Brahman's being the universal Self, we
have explained before. In the clause 'not so, not so' the so refers back
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as established by other means of proof, and the clause <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

incomprehensible, for he is not comprehended, he is undecaying,' &c.;
which means--as he is different in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from what is comprehended by
the other means of proof he is not grasped by those means; as he is
different from what suffers decay he does not decay, and so on. And

But, an objection is raised, the text, 'Those who depart from hence,

40. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of him who has approached (Brahman); just on that
account, this being declared by the text.

When the soul, released from all bonds and manifesting itself in its

point will be proved in greater detail in the fourth adhyâya. Meanwhile
the conclusion is that such qualities as satyakâmatva have to be
included in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of him also who is desirous of release; for
the possession of those qualities forms part of the experience of the
released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> itself.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'wishes and the
rest'




41. There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen; for
there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction.

There are certain meditations connected with elements of sacrificial
actions; as e.g. 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the syllable Om as udgîtha.'
These meditations are subordinate elements of the sacrificial acts with
which they connect themselves through the udgîtha and so on, in the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the quality of being made of parna wood connects itself with the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> through the ladle (made of parna wood), and are to be
undertaken on that very account. Moreover the statement referring to
these meditations, viz. 'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith,
with the Upanishad, that becomes more vigorous,' does not allow the
assumption of a special fruit for these meditations (apart from the
fruit of the sacrificial performance); while in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the ladle
being made of parna wood the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> mentions a special fruit ('he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

the particular sacrificial performances to which they belong.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
the Sûtra refutes, 'There is non-restriction with regard to the
determinations.' By 'determination' we have here to understand the
definite settling of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in a certain direction, in other words,
meditation. The meditations on the udgîtha and so on are not definitely
connected with the sacrificial performances; 'since that is seen,' i.e.
since the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> themselves declare that there is no such necessary
connexion; cp. the text, 'therefore both perform the sacrificial work,
he who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows it (i. e. who possesses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> implied in the
meditations on the sacrifice), as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as he who does not know'--which
declares that he also who does not know the meditations may perform the
work. Were these meditations auxiliary elements of the works, there
could be no such absence of necessary connexion (as declared in this
text). It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being determined that they are not auxiliary elements, a
special result must be assigned to the injunction of meditation, and
this we <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> in the greater strength which is imparted to the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
by the meditation, and which is a result different from the result of
the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> itself. The _greater strength_ of the performance consists
herein, that its result is not impeded, as it might be impeded, by the
result of some other performance of greater force. This result, viz.
absence of obstruction, is something apart from the general result of
the action, such as the reaching of the heavenly world, and so on. This
the Sûtra means when saying, 'for separate is non-obstruction.' As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
those meditations also which refer to auxiliary members of sacrifices
have their own results, they may or may not be combined with the
sacrifices, according to wish. Their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is like that of the godohana
vessel which, with the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of obtaining a certain special result, may
be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> instead of the kamasa.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'non-
restriction of determination.'




42. Just as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the offerings. This has been explained.

In the daharavidyâ (Ch. Up. VIII, 1 ff.) the text, 'those who depart
having known here the Self, and those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> desires,' declares at first a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the small ether, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, and separately
therefrom a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on its qualities, viz. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> desires, and so on.
The doubt here arises whether, in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on those qualities, the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self--as that to which the qualities belong--
is to be repeated or not.--It is not to be repeated, the Pûrvapakshin
maintains; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is just that which is constituted by the
qualities--freedom from all evil, and so on--and as that Self so
constituted can be comprised in one meditation, there is no need of
repeating the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the qualities.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the
Sûtra sets aside. The <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> has to be repeated. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self
indeed is that being to which alone freedom from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and the other
qualities belong, and it forms the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the first meditation; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
there is a difference between it as viewed in its essential being and as
viewed as possessing those qualities; and moreover, the clause 'free
from evil, from old age,' &c. enjoins a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Self as
possessing those qualities. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> first to be meditated on in
its essential nature, and then there takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a repetition of the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on it in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> in those special qualities. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
is analogous to that of 'the offerings.' There is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'He is to offer
a purodâsa on eleven potsherds to Indra the ruler, to Indra the supreme
ruler, to Indra the self-ruler.' This injunction refers to one and the
same Indra, possessing the qualities of rulership and so on; but as,
through connexion with those several qualities, the aspects of Indra
differ, the oblation of the purodâsa has to be repeated. This is
declared in the Sânkarshana, 'The divinities are different on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
separation.'--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'offerings.'




43. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the plurality of indicatory marks; for that (proof) is
stronger. This also is declared (in the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ).

The Taittirîyaka contains another daharavidyâ, 'The thousand-headed god,
the all-eyed one,' &c. (Mahânâr. Up. XI). Here the doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
this vidyâ, as being one with the previously introduced vidyâ, states
qualities to be included in the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> enjoined in that vidyâ, or
qualities to be included in the meditations on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as
enjoined in all the Vedânta-texts.--The former is the case, the
Pûrvapakshin holds, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the leading subject-matter. For in the
preceding section (X) the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the small ether is introduced as
the subject-matter. 'There is the small lotus placed in the middle of
the town (of the body), <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all evil, the abode of the Highest;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> that there is a small space, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sorrow--what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
that should be meditated upon' (Mahânâr. Up. X, 23). Now, as the lotus
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is mentioned only in section X, the 'Nârâyana-section'
('the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> resembling the bud of a lotus, with its point turned
downwards,' XI, 6), we conclude that that section also is concerned with
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> to which the daharavidyâ refers.--Against this
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra declares itself, 'on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the majority of
indicatory marks'; i.e. there are in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> several marks proving that
that section is meant to declare characteristics of that which
constitutes the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in all meditations on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
being. For that being which in those meditations is denoted as the
Imperishable, Siva, Sambhu. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> light, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> entity, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, and so on, is here referred to by the
same names, and then declared to be Nârâyana. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> several
indications to prove that Nârâyana is none other than that which is the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in all meditations on the Highest, viz. Brahman,
which has bliss and the rest for its qualities. By 'linga' (inferential
mark) we here understand clauses (vâkya) which contain a specific
indication; for such clauses have, according to the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ,
greater proving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> than leading subject-matter (prakarana). The
argumentation that the clause 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> resembling the bud of a lotus
flower,' &c., proves that section to stand in a dependent relation to
the daharavidyâ, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> force; for it being proved by a stronger
argument that the section refers to that which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in all meditations, the clause mentioned may also be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as
declaring that in the daharavidyâ also the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is
Nârâyana. Nor must it be <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that the accusatives with which the
section begins (sahasrasirsham, &c.) are to be connected with the
'meditating' enjoined in the previous section; for the 'meditating' is
there enjoined by a gerundive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> ('tasmin yad antas tad upâsitavyam'),
and with this the subsequent accusatives cannot be construed. Moreover,
the subsequent clause ('all this is Nârâyana,' &c., where the nominative
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is used) shows that those accusatives are to be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of nominatives.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the plurality of
indicatory marks.'




44. There is option with regard to what precedes (i.e. the altar made of
bricks) on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of subject-matter, and hence there is action; as in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the mânasa cup.

In the Vâjasaneyaka, in the Agnirahasya chapter, there are references to
certain altars built of mind, 'built of mind, built of speech,' &c. The
doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those structures of mind, and so on, which
metaphorically are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> fire-altars, should be considered as being of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of action, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their connexion with a performance
which itself is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of action; or merely of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
meditation, as being connected with an activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
meditation. The Sûtra maintains the former view. Since those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
'built of mind, and so on,' are, through being _built_ (or _piled _up),
constituted as fire-altars, they demand a performance with which to
connect themselves; and as in immediate proximity to them no performance
is enjoined, and as the general subject-matter of the section is the
fire-altar built of bricks--introduced by means of the clause 'Non-being
this was in the beginning'---which is invariably connected with a
performance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of outward action, viz. a certain sacrificial
performance--we conclude that the altars built of mind, &c., which the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> mentions in connexion with the same subject-matter, are themselves
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of action, and as such can be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as alternatives for the
altar built of bricks. [FOOTNOTE 668:1]. An analogous <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is presented
by the so-called _mental_ cup. On the tenth, so-called avivâkya, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of
the Soma <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> extending over twelve days, there takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the
mental <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> of a Soma cup, all the rites connected with which are
rehearsed in imagination only; the <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> of that cup is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> really
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> only, but as it forms an auxiliary element in
an actual outward sacrificial performance it itself assumes the
character of an action.

[FOOTNOTE 668:1. So that for the actual outward construction of a brick
altar there may optionally be substituted the merely mental construction
of an imaginary altar.]




45. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the transfer.

That the altar built of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is an optional substitute for the altar
built of bricks, and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of an action, appears therefrom also
that the clause 'of these each one is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as that previous one,'
explicitly transfers to the altars of mind, and so on, the powers of the
previous altar made of bricks. All those altars <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> having equal

they help to accomplish, and hence themselves of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of action.--
Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra declares itself.




46. But it is a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of assertion and what is
seen.

The altars built of mind, and so on, are not of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of action,
but of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only, i.e. they belong to a performance which is of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only. For this is what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> asserts, viz.
in the clauses 'they are built of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only,' and 'by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
they are built for him who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows.' As the energies of mind, speech,
sight, and so on, cannot be piled up like bricks, it is indeed a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
of course that the so-called altars constructed of mind, and so on, can
be mental constructions only; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> in addition specially
confirms this by declaring that those altars are elements in an activity
of purely intellectual character, and hence themselves mere creatures of
the intellect. Moreover there is seen in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> a performance
consisting of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> only to which those fires stand in a subsidiary
relation, 'by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> they were established on hearths, by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
they were built up, by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the Soma cups were drawn thereat; by the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> they chanted, and by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> they recited; whatever rite is
performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that, as
consisting of mind, was performed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> only, on those (fire-
altars) composed of mind, built up of mind.' From this declaration, that
whatever sacrificial rite is actually performed in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of fire-
altars built of bricks is performed mentally only in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of altars
built of mind, it follows that the entire performance is a mental one
only, i.e. an act of meditation.--But, an objection is raised, as the
entire passus regarding the altars of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> does not contain any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of
injunctive power, and as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> states no special result (from which
it appears to follow that the passus does not enjoin a new independent
performance), we must, on the strength of the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the leading
subject-matter is an actual sacrificial performance as suggested by the
altars built of brick, give up the idea that the altars built of mind,
&c., are mental only because connected with a performance of merely
mental nature.--This objection the next Sûtra refutes.




47. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the greater strength of direct statement, and so
on, there is no refutation.

The weaker means of proof, constituted by so-called leading subject-
matter, cannot refute what is established by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stronger means of
proof--direct statement, inferential mark, and syntactical connexion--
viz. that there is an independent purely mental performance, and that
the altars made of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> are parts of the latter. The direct statement is
contained in the following passage, 'Those fire-altars indeed are built
of knowledge,'--which is further explained in the subsequent passage,
'by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone these altars are built for him who knows this'--the
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of which is: the structures of mind, and so on, are built in
connexion with a performance which consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (i.e.
meditation).--The inferential mark is contained in the passage, 'For him
all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> at all times build them, even while he is asleep.' And the
syntactical connexion (vâkya) consists in the connexion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
evamvide (for him who knows this), and kinvanti (they build)--the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span>
being: for him who accomplishes the performance consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> at all times build those altars. The proving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> above referred to as containing an indicatory mark (linga) lies
therein that a construction mentally performed at all times by all
<span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> cannot possibly connect itself with a sacrificial performance
through the brick-altar, which is constructed by certain definite agents
and on certain definite occasions only, and must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be an element
in a mental performance, i.e. a meditation.--The next Sûtra disposes of
the objection that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> cannot possibly mean to enjoin a new mental
performance, apart from the actual performance, because it contains no
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of injunctive force and does not mention a special result.




48. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of connexions and the rest, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
separateness of other cognitions. And this is seen (elsewhere also); as
declared (in the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ).

That the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins a meditative performance different from the actual
performance of which the brick-altar is a constituent element, follows
from the reasons proving separation, viz. _the connexions_. i.e. the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> connected with the sacrifice, such as the Soma cups, the hymns,
the recitations, and so on. What is meant is that the special mention of
the cups, and so on, made in the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> the Soma cups were
drawn thereat,' proves the difference of the performance.--The 'and the
rest' of the Sûtra comprises the previously stated arguments, viz.
direct statement, and so on. 'As other meditations,' i.e. the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is
analogous to that of other meditations such as the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, which are likewise proved by textual
statement, and so on, to be different and separate from actual outward
sacrificial performances.--The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a separate meditative act
having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> been ascertained, the requisite injunction has to be
construed on the basis of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> as it stands.

Such construction of injunctions on the basis of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of arthavâda
character is seen in other places also; the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is discussed in Pû.
Mî. Sûtras III, 5, 21.--The result of the meditative performance follows
from the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> 'of these (altars made of mind, and so on) each is as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as that former one (i.e. the altar built of bricks)'--for this
implies that the same result which the brick-altar accomplishes through
the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> of which it forms an element is also attained through the
altars made of mind, and so on, through the meditations of which they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> parts.--The next Sûtra disposes of the argumentation that, as this
formal transfer of the result of the brick-altar to the altars built of
mind, and so on, shows the latter to possess the same virtues as the
former, we are bound to conclude that they also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> constituent
elements of an actual (not merely meditative) performance.




49. Not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of this being observed on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of similarity
also; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Death; for (the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in yonder orb) does not
occupy the worlds (of Death).

From a transfer or assimilation of this kind it does not necessarily
follow that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of different operation are equal, and that hence
those altars of mind, and so on, must connect themselves with an actual
outward performance. For it is observed that such assimilation rests
sometimes on a special point of resemblance only; so in the text, 'The
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in yonder orb is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Death</span> indeed,'--where the feature of resemblance
is the destroying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the two; for the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> yonder orb
does certainly not occupy the same worlds, i.e. the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as Death.
Analogously, in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under discussion, the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the altars made
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> are treated as, in a certain respect, equivalent to the altar
built of bricks, does not authorise us to connect those altars with the
sacrificial performance to which the altar of bricks belongs. When the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says that the altar made of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as the altar of bricks,
this only means that the same result which is attained through the brick-
altar in connexion with its own sacrificial performance is also attained
through the altar of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in connexion with the meditational performance
into which it enters.




50. And by a subsequent (Brâhmana) also the 'being of such a kind' of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> (is proved). But the connexion is on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of plurality.

The subsequent Brâhmana (Sat. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
treating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
only. For that Brâhmana (which begins 'This brick-built fire-altar is
this world; the waters are its enclosing-stones,' &c.) declares further
on 'whosoever knows this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> comes to be that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> who is the
space-filler,' and from this it appears that what is enjoined there is a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> with a special result of its own. And further on (X, 6) there
is another <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> enjoined, viz. one on Vaisvânara. All this shows
that the Agnirahasya <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> (Sat. Br. X) is not solely concerned with the
injunction of outward sacrificial acts.--But what then is the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span>
that such matters as the mental (meditative) construction of fire-altars
which ought to be included in the Brihad-âranyaka are included in the
Agnirahasya?--'That connexion is on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of plurality,' i.e. the
altars made of mind, and so on, are, in the sacred text, dealt with in
proximity to the real altar made of bricks, because so many details of
the latter are mentally to be accomplished in the meditation.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'option with the previous one.'




51. Some, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a Self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a body.

In all meditations on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the meditating
subject has to be ascertained no less than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and of the mode of meditation. The question then arises
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the meditating Self is to be viewed as the knowing, doing, and
enjoying Self, subject to transmigration; or as that Self which
Prajâpati describes (Ch. Up. VIII, 1), viz. a Self <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and
imperfection.--Some hold the former view, on the ground that the
meditating Self is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a body. For as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the Self dwells <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>
a body, it _is_ a knower, doer, enjoyer, and so on, and it can <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
about the result of its <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> only as viewed under that aspect. A
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who, desirous of the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> or a similar result, enters
on some sacrificial action may, after he has reached that result,
possess characteristics different from those of a knowing, doing, and
enjoying subject, but those characteristics cannot be attributed to him
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he is in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of having to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about the means of
accomplishing those ends; in the latter <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> he must be viewed as an
ordinary agent, and there it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be of no <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> him as something
different. And the same holds equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>

agent engaged in sacrificial action, and the meditating subject), and
from this it follows that the meditating Self is to be conceived as
having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all evil, and so on.--Not so, the Pûrvapakshin
replies; for the clause, 'howsoever they meditate on him,' proves that
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to the equality of the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> (not of
the meditating subject).--To this the next Sûtra replies.




52. But this is not so, (but rather) difference; since it is of the
being of that; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of intuition.

It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the meditating subject must be conceived as having
the ordinary characteristics of knowing, acting, &c.; it rather
possesses those characteristic properties--freedom from evil, and so on--
which distinguish the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release from the Samsâra state. At the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> the Self of the devotee is of exactly the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
as the released Self. 'For it is of the being of that,' i.e. it attains
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of that--as proved by the texts, 'as the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is
in this world, so he will be when he has departed,' and 'howsoever he
meditate on him, such he becomes himself.' Nor can it be maintained that
these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> refer only to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self (without
declaring anything as to the personal Self of the devotee); for the
personal Self constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
meditation, and hence itself falls under the category of <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of
meditation. The character of such meditation, therefore, is that it is a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self as having for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the individual
Self, distinguished by freedom from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and the other qualities
mentioned in the teaching of Prajâpati. And hence the individual Self is,
in such meditation, to be conceived (not as the ordinary Self, but)
under that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> which it has to attain (i.e. the pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> which belongs
to it in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release). 'As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of intuition'--i.e. as
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of intuition of Brahman. As the intuition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> has for
its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Brahman, so the intuition of the
individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also has for its <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> its permanent essential nature.
In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> the conception of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the Self forms an auxiliary factor. An injunction such as 'Let him who
is desirous of the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> sacrifice,' enjoins the performance of
the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to the end of a certain result being reached; while the
conception of the Self as possessing characteristics such as being a
knowing subject, and so on--which are separate from the body--has the
function of proving its qualification for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> meant to effect results
which will come about at some future time. So much only (i.e. the mere
cognition of the Self as something different from the body) is required
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> (as distinguished from meditations).--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'being in the body.'




53. But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of
sacrifices) are not (restricted) to (particular) sâkhâs, but rather
(belong) to all sâkhâs.

There are certain meditations connected with certain constituent
elements of sacrifices-as e.g. 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the syllable Om
(as) the Udgîtha '(Ch. Up. I, 1, 1); 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the fivefold
Saman as the five worlds' (Ch. Up. II, 2, 1), &c. The question here
arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those meditations are restricted to the members of those
sâkhâs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> they are mentioned; or to be connected with the
Udgîtha, and so on, in all sâkhâs. There is here a legitimate ground for
doubt, in so far as, although the general agreement of all Vedânta-texts
is established, the Udgîtha, and so on, are different in each Veda since
the accents differ in the different Vedas--The Pûrvapakshin declares
that those meditations are limited each to its particular sâkhâ; for, he
says, the injunction 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha' does indeed,
verbally, refer to the Udgîtha in general; but as what stands nearest to
this injunction is the special Udgîtha of the sâkhâ, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> this
injunction occurs, and which shares the peculiarities of accent
characteristic of that sâkhâ, we decide that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is enjoined
on members of that sâkhâ only.--The Sûtra sets this opinion aside. The
injunction of meditations of this type is valid for all sâkhâs, since
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> expressly connects them with the Udgîtha in general. They
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> wherever there is an Udgîtha. The individual
Udgîthas of the several sâkhâs are indeed distinguished by different
accentuation; but the general statement, 'Let him meditate on the
Udgîtha.' suggests to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> not any particular Udgîtha, but _the_
Udgîtha in general, and hence there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to restrict the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> to a particular sâkhâ. From the principle moreover that all
sâkhâs teach the same doctrine, it follows that the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> enjoined
in the different sâkhâs is one only; and hence there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to
hold that the Udgîtha suggested by the injunction of the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is a
particular one. For the Udgîtha is only an element in the sacrifice, and
the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is one and the same. The meditations are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
limited to particular sâkhâs.




54. Or there is no contradiction as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of mantras and the rest.

The 'or' here has the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of 'and.' The 'and the rest' comprises
generic characteristics, qualities, number, similarity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
succession, substances, and actions. As there is nothing contrary to
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> in mantras and the rest, although mentioned in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of one
sâkhâ only, finding, on the basis of such means of proof as direct
statement, and so on, their application in all sâkhâs, since the
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to which they belong is one and the same in all sâkhâs; so
there is likewise no contradiction in the meditations under discussion
being undertaken by members of all sâkhâs.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'what is connected with constituent elements of the
sacrifice.'




55. There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the sacrifice;
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Scripture shows.

The sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> (Ch. Up. V, 12 ff.) enjoins a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Vaisvânara,
the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, as having for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the
entire threefold world, and for its limbs the heavenly world, the sun,
the wind, and so on. The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> separate meditations
have to be performed on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being in its separate aspects, or in
its aggregate as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in its distributed aspect, or in its aggregate
aspect only.--In its separate aspects, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; since
at the outset a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of that kind is declared. For on the Rishis
in succession telling Asvapati the objects of their meditation, viz. the
sky, the sun, and so on, Asvapati explains to them that these
meditations refer to the head, eye, and so on, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being, and
mentions for each of these meditations a special fruit. And the
concluding explanation 'he who worships Vaisvânara as a span long, &c.,'
is merely meant to gather up into one, as it were, the preceding
meditations on the parts of Vaisvânara.--Another Pûrvapakshin holds that
this very concluding <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> enjoins a further <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Vaisvânara
in his collective aspect, in addition to the previously enjoined
meditations on his limbs; for that <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> states a separate result, 'he
eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in all worlds,' &c. Nor does this destroy the unity of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
'plenitude' (bhûman; Ch. Up. VII, 23). There, in the beginning,
separate meditations are enjoined on name, and so on, with special
results of their own; and after that a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is enjoined on bhûman,
with a result of its own, 'He becomes a Self-ruler,' &c. The entire
section really refers to the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on bhûman; but all the same
there are admitted subordinate meditations on name, and so on, and a
special result for each.--These views are <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside by the Sûtra, 'There
is pre-eminence of plenitude,' i.e. there is <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to assume that
Vaisvânara in his fulness, i.e. in his collective aspect, is meant;
since we apprehend unity of the entire section. From the beginning of
the section it is manifest that what the Rishis <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to know is the
Vaisânara Self; it is that Self which Asvapati expounds to them as
having the Universe for his body, and in agreement therewith the last
clause of his teaching intimates that the intuition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (which is
none other than the Vaisvânara Self)--which is there characterised as
the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of all worlds, all beings, all Selfs--is the fruit of the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Vaisvânara. This summing up proves the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section to
deal with the same subject. And on the basis of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> we
determine that what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says as to meditations on the separate
members of the Vaisânara Self and their special results is merely of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of explanatory comment (anuvâda) on parts of the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
the collective Self.--This decision is arrived at as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
sacrifice. For to the injunction of certain sacrifices--such as 'Let a
man, on the birth of a son, offer a cake on twelve potsherds to
Vaisvânara'--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> similarly adds remarks on parts of the oblation,
'there is an oblation on eight potsherds,' and so on.--The <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> has to be performed on the entire Vaisvânara Self only, not on
its parts. This, moreover, Scripture itself intimates, in so far, namely,
as declaring the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> consequences of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on parts of the Self
only, 'your <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have fallen off if you had not come to me'; 'you
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have become blind,' and so on. This also shows that the reference
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoining meditations on name, &c., proves nothing as to our
passage. For there the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says nothing as to disadvantages connected
with those special meditations; it only says that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
plenitude (bhûman) has a more excellent result. The section, therefore,
although really concerned with enjoining the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the bhûman,
at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> means to declare that the special meditations also are
fruitful; otherwise the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the bhûman could not be
recommended, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that it has a more excellent result than the
preceding meditations.--The conclusion, therefore, is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
enjoins a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the collective Vaisvânara Self only.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'the pre-eminence of plenitude.'




56. (The meditations are) separate, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the difference of
words, and so on.

The instances coming under this <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of discussion are all those
meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which have for their only result final Release,
which consists in attaining to Brahman--such as the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on that
which is, the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the bhûman, the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the small
space <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, the Upakosala meditation, the Sândilya
meditation, the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Vaisvânara, the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Self of
bliss, the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Imperishable, and others--whether they be
recorded in one sâkhâ only or in several sâkhâs. To a different category
belong those meditations which have a special <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> such as Prâna, and
a special result.--The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the meditations of the
former class are all to be considered as identical, or as separate--The
Pûrvapakshin holds that they are all one; for, he says, they all have
one and the same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of meditation, viz. Brahman. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
all cognition depends on the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> cognised; and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
meditations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being one, the meditations themselves are one.--This
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra controverts. The meditations are different, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the difference of terms and the rest. The 'and the rest' comprises
repetition (abhyâsa), <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> (samkhyâ), quality (guna), subject-matter
(prakriyâ), and name (nâmadheya; cp. Pû. Mî. Sû. II, 2, 1 ff.). We meet
in those meditations with difference of connexion, expressing itself in
difference of words, and so on; which causes difference on the part of
the meditations enjoined. The terms enjoining meditation, 'he knows,'
'he is to meditate' (veda; upâsîta), and so on, do indeed all of them
denote a certain continuity of cognition, and all these cognitions have
for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> only, but all the same those cognitions differ
in so far as they have for their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> Brahman, as variously qualified
by special characteristics mentioned in the meditation; in one
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> he is spoken of as the sole cause of the world, in another as
<span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from all evil, and so on. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> arrive at the decision that
clauses which describe special forms of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> having for their
result the attainment to Brahman, and are complete in themselves, convey
the idea of separate independent meditations, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> effect separation
of the vidyâs. This entire question was indeed already decided in the
Pûrva Mimâmsa-sûtras (II, 2, 1), but it is here argued again to the end
of dispelling the mistaken notion that the Vedânta-texts aim at
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> only, and not at the injunction of activities such as
meditation. The meditations, therefore, are separate ones.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'difference of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and the rest.'




57. Option, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the non-difference of result.

It has been proved that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on that which truly is, the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, and so on--all of which
have for their result the attainment to Brahman--are separate
meditations. The question now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> all these meditations
should be combined by each meditating devotee, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of such
combination being useful to him; or whether, in the absence of any <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
of such combination, they should be undertaken optionally.--They may be
combined, the Pûrvapakshin holds; since it is observed that different
scriptural matters are combined even when having one and the same result.
The Agnihotra, the Daisapûrnamâsa oblation, and other sacrifices, all of
them have one and the same result, viz. the possession of the heavenly
world; nevertheless, one and the same agent performs them all, with a
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the greater fulness of the heavenly bliss aimed at. So the
different meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also may be cumulated with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to
greater fulness of intuition of Brahman.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra rejects.
Option only between the several meditations is possible, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
the non-difference of result. For to all meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> alike
Scripture assigns one and the same result, viz. intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
Brahman, which is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of supreme, unsurpassable bliss. 'He who
knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> attains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1), &c. The
intuitive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> constitutes supreme, unsurpassable bliss;
and if such intuition may be reached through one meditation, of what <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span>
could other meditations be? The heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is something limited in
respect of place, time, and essential nature, and hence a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span>
desirous of attaining to it may cumulate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
possession of it to a greater extent, and so on. But an analogous
proceeding cannot be resorted to with regard to Brahman, which is
unlimited in every sense. All meditations on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> tend to dispel
Nescience, which stands in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the intuition of Brahman, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
equally have for their result the attaining to Brahman; and hence there
is option between them. In the case, on the other hand, of those
meditations which aim at other results than Brahman, there may either be
choice between the several meditations, or they may be cumulated--as one
may also do in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of sacrifices aiming at the attainment of the
heavenly world;--for as those results are not of an infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> one
may aim at realising them in a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> degree. This the next Sûtra
declares.




58. But meditations aiming at objects of <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> may, according to one's
liking, be cumulated or not; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the absence of the former
reason.

The last clause means--on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their results not being of an
infinite nature.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'option.'




59. They belong to the constituent members, as the bases.

A doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> meditations such as the one enjoined in the text,
'Let him meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgîtha,' which are
connected with constituent elements of the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> such as the Udgîtha,
contribute towards the accomplishment of the sacrifice, and hence must
be performed at the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> as part of it; or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they, like the
godohana vessel, benefit the agent apart from the sacrifice, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> may be undertaken according to desire.--But has it not been
already decided under III, 3, 42 that those meditations are generally
beneficial to man, and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> restricted to the sacrifices?--True;
it is just for the purpose of further confirming that conclusion that
objections are now raised against it on the ground of some inferential
marks (linga) and reasoning. For there it was maintained on the strength
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'therefore he does both' that those meditations have results
independent of the sacrifice. But there are several reasons favouring
the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that those meditations must be connected with the sacrifices as
subordinate members, just as the Udgîtha and the rest to which the
meditations refer.

Their <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is by no means analogous to that of the godohana vessel, for,
while in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the latter, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> expressly declares the
<span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a special result, 'For him who is desirous of cattle he is
to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in a godohana,' the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoining those meditations do
not <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> special results for them. For clauses such as 'he is to
meditate on the Udgîtha' intimate only that the Udgîtha is connected
with the meditation; while their connexion with certain results is known
from other clauses, such as 'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith,
with the Upanishad, that is more vigorous' (according to which the
result of such meditations is only to strengthen the result of the
sacrifices). And when a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> of this kind has, on the ground of
its connexion with the Udgîtha or the like--which themselves are
invariably connected with sacrifices--been cognised to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> an element
of a sacrifice, some other <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which may declare a fruit for that
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> can only be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as an arthavâda; just as the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which
declares that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> sacrificial ladle is made of parna wood does not
hear an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> sound. In the same way, therefore, as the Udgîtha and so on,
which are the bases of those meditations, are to be employed only as
constituent parts of the sacrifices, so the meditations also connected
with those constituent parts are themselves to be employed as
constituent parts of the sacrifices only.




60. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of injunction.

The above conclusion is further confirmed by the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of injunction, i.e.
thereby that clauses such as 'he is to meditate on the Udgîtha' enjoin
the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> as standing to the Udgîtha in the relation of a
subordinate member. Injunctions of this kind differ from injunctions
such as 'he is to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in the godohana vessel for him who desires
cattle'; for the latter <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> a special qualification on the part of him
who performs the action, while the former do not, and hence cannot claim
independence.




61. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of rectification.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'from the seat of the Hotri he sets right the wrong Udgîha'
shows that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is necessarily required for the purpose of
correcting whatever mistake may be made in the Udgîtha. This also proves
that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is an integral part of the sacrificial performance.




62. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the declaration of a quality being common (to all
the Vedas).

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'By means of that syllable the threefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> proceeds.
With _Om_ the Adhvaryu gives orders, with _Om_ the Hotri recites, with _Om_
the Udgâtri sings,' which declares the pranava--which is a 'quality' of
the meditation, in so far as it is its basis--to be common to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

with the sacrifice. For the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is connected with the Udgîtha,
and the Udgitha is an integral part of all sacrificial performances
whatever.

Of the primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the next Sûtra disposes.




63. Rather not, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not declare their going together.

It is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the meditations on the Udgîtha and the rest are
bound to the sacrifices in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the Udgîtha, and so on,
themselves are; for Scripture does not declare that they go <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span>
with, i.e. are subordinate constituents of the Udgîtha, and so on. The
clause 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha' does not indeed itself <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
another qualification on the part of the agent (i.e. does not <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that
the agent in entering on the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is prompted by a motive other
than the one prompting the sacrifice); but the subsequent clause,
'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that
becomes more vigorous,' intimates that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is the means to render
the sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> more efficacious, and from this it follows that the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is enjoined as a means towards effecting a result other than
the result of the sacrifice. And hence the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> cannot be viewed
as a subordinate member of the Udgîtha, which itself is a subordinate
member of the sacrifice. It rather has the Udgîtha for its basis only.
He only indeed who is qualified for the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is qualified for the
meditation, since the latter aims at greater efficaciousness of the
sacrifice; but this does not imply that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> necessarily goes
with the sacrifice. By the greater vigour of the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is meant its
non-obstruction by some other sacrificial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of greater strength, its

'he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> ladle is of parna wood hears no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> sound' is different.
There the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not declare that the quality of consisting of parna
wood is the direct means of bringing about the result of no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> sound
being heard; hence there is no valid <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why that quality should not
be subordinate to the ladle, which itself is subordinate to the
sacrifice; and as it is not legitimate to assume for the mere
subordinate constituents of a <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> special fruits (other than the
general fruit of the sacrifice), the declaration as to no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> sound
being <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> is to be viewed as a mere arthavâda (i.e. a mere additional
statement meant further to glorify the result of the sacrifice--of which
the ladle made of parna wood is a subordinate instrument).




64. And because (Scripture) shows it.

A scriptural text, moreover, shows that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is necessary for,
and restricted to, the sacrificial performance. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
priest who knows this saves the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and all the
officiating priests'--which declares that all priests are saved through
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Brahman--has <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> only on the understanding that
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is not restricted to the Udjâtri, and so on (i.e. not to
those priests who are engaged in carrying out the details of the
sacrifices which are the 'bases' of the meditations).--The conclusion,
therefore, is that those meditations are not restricted to the
sacrifices, subordinate members of which serve as their 'bases.'--This
terminates the adhikarana of 'like the bases.'




FOURTH PÂDA.

1. The benefit to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> results from thence, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of scriptural
statement; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Bâdarâyana thinks.

We have concluded the investigation into the oneness or diverseness of
meditations--the result of which is to indicate in which cases the
special points mentioned in several meditations have to be combined, and
in which not. A further point now to be investigated is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> that
advantage to the meditating devotee, which is held to accrue to him from
the meditation, results from the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> directly, or from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of
which the meditations are subordinate members.--The Reverend Bâdarâyana
holds the former view. The benefit to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> results from thence, i.e. from
the meditation, because Scripture declares this to be so. 'He who knows
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'I know that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> of sun-like lustre beyond the darkness. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who knows him truly
passes over death; there is no other path to go' (Svet. Up. III, 8); 'As
the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and their
form, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who possesses knowledge, freed from name and form, goes
to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> who is greater than the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8).--
Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Pûrvapakshin raises an objection.




2. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (the Self) standing in a complementary relation, they
are arthavâdas, as in other cases; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Jaimini opines.

What has been said as to Scripture intimating that a beneficial result
is realised through the meditations by themselves is untenable. For
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'he who knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches the Highest' do not teach
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aim of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is attained through knowledge; their purport
rather is to inculcate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> on the part of a Self which is
the agent in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> prescribed. Knowledge, therefore, stands in a
complementary relation to sacrificial works, in so far as it imparts to
the acting Self a certain mystic purification; and the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which
declare special results of knowledge, therefore, must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as mere
arthavâdas. 'As in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of other things; so Jaimini thinks,' i.e. as
Jaimini holds that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of substances, qualities, and so on, the
scriptural declaration of results is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of arthavâda.--But it
has been shown before that the Vedânta-texts represent as the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to
be attained, by those desirous of Release, on the basis of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
imparted by them, something different from the individual Self engaged
in action; cp. on this point Sû. I, 1, 15; I, 3, 5; I, 2, 3; I, 3, 18.
And Sû. II, 1, 22 and others have refuted the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is to be
considered as non-different from the personal soul, because in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
such as 'thou <span class="t2 t6 t8 t9 t10 t15 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">art</span> that' it is exhibited in co-ordination with the latter.
And other Sûtras have proved that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> must, on the basis of numerous
scriptural texts, be recognised as the inner Self of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> material
and immaterial. How then can it be said that the Vedânta-texts merely
mean to give instruction as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the active individual
soul, and that hence all <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is merely subservient to sacrificial
works?--On the strength of numerous inferential marks, the Pûrvapakshin
replies, which prove that in the Vedânta-texts all <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is really
viewed as subordinate to knowledge, and of the declarations of co-
ordination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (which must be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to
imply that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are essentially of the same nature), we cannot help
forming the conclusion that the real purport of the Vedânta-texts is to
tell us of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in so far as different
from its body.--But, again it is objected, the agent is connected no
less with ordinary worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> than with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> enjoined by the Veda,
and hence is not invariably connected with sacrifices (i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the
latter type); it cannot, therefore, be maintained that meditations on
the part of the agent necessarily connect themselves with sacrifices in
so far as they effect a purification of the sacrificer's mind!--There is
a difference, the Pûrvapakshin rejoins. Worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> can proceed also
if the agent is non-different from the body; while an agent is qualified
for sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only in so far as he is different from the body, and of
an <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> non-changing nature. Meditations, therefore, properly connect
themselves with sacrifices, in so far as they teach that the agent
really is of that latter nature. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> adhere to the conclusion that
meditations are constituents of sacrificial actions, and hence are of no
advantage by themselves.--But what then are those inferential marks
which, as you say, fully prove that the Vedânta-texts aim at setting
forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the individual soul?--To this the next Sûtra replies.




3. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (such) conduct being seen.

It is seen, <span class="t5 t10 hoverable">viz</span> in Scripture, that those who knew <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> busied
themselves chiefly with sacrifices.--Asvapati Kaikeya had a deep

instruction regarding the Self, he told them 'I am about, to perform a
sacrifice, Sirs' (Ch. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Smriti that
Janaka and other princes deeply versed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
applied themselves to sacrificial works, 'By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only Janaka and
others attained to perfection'; 'He also, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> founded in knowledge,
offered many sacrifices.' And this fact--that those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

has no independent value, but serves to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
active Self, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> is subordinate to work.--An even more direct proof
is <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the next Sûtra.




4. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of direct scriptural statement.

Scripture itself directly declares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to be subordinate to works,
'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that
is more vigorous'. Nor can it be said that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers, on the
ground of leading subject-matter (prakarana), to the Udgîtha only; for
direct scriptural statement (suti) is stronger than subject-matter, and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 'whatever he does with knowledge' clearly refer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
in general.




5. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the taking hold together.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'then both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> hold of him' (Bri. Up. IV, 4,
2) shows that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> go together, and this going <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> is
possible only if, in the manner stated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is subordinate to work.




6. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of injunction for such a one.

That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is subordinate to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> follows therefrom also that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
are enjoined on him only who possesses knowledge. For <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'He
who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers,' &c. (Ch. Up. VIII,
15), enjoin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> on him only who has mastered the sacred <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> so as
fully to understand their meaning--for this is the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term
'learning' (adhyayana). Hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> also is enjoined
with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only: it has no independent result of its own.




7. On <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of definite rule.

Another argument for our conclusion is that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Doing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> here
let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to live a hundred years,' &c. (Is. Up. II), expressly
enjoins lifelong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> on him who knows the Self. The general conclusion,
therefore, is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (meditation) is merely auxiliary to works.
Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the next Sûtra finally disposes.




8. But on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the teaching of the different one, Badarâyana's
(view is valid); as this is seen.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> by itself benefits man; since Scripture teaches that the
<span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which, as it is of an
absolutely faultless and perfect nature, is other than the active
individual soul.

Badarâyana, therefore, holds that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> has an independent fruit of
its own. Let the inferential marks (referred to by the Pûrvapakshin) be;
the direct teaching of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> certainly refers to a being different
from the Self that acts; for we clearly see that their <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> creative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> with all its perfections and exalted qualities,
which cannot possibly be attributed to the individual Self <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of Release or of bondage: 'Free from evil, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from old age,'
&c. &c. In all those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> there is not the slightest trace of any
reference to the wretched individual soul, as insignificant and weak as
a tiny glow-worm, implicated in Nescience and all the other evils of
finite existence. And the fruit of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span>
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> expressly declare, in many places, to be immortality--which
consists in attaining to Him. The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by itself
benefitting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> founded.--The Sûtras proceed to
dispose of the so-called inferential marks.




9. But the declarations are equal.

The argument that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must be held subordinate to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> because we
learn from Scripture that those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> perform sacrificial
works, will not hold good; since, on the other hand, we also see that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> abandoned all work; cp. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'The Rishis
descended from Kavasha said: For what purpose should we study the Veda?
for what purpose should we sacrifice?' As it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears that those who
know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> give up works, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> cannot be a mere auxiliary to
works.--But how can it be accounted for that those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> both
do and do not perform works?--Works may be performed in so far as
sacrifices and the like, if performed by one not having any special wish,
stand in subordinate relation to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman; hence there
is no objection to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoining works. And as, on the other hand,
sacrifices and such-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> when aiming at results of their own are
opposed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which has Release for its only
result, there is all the less objection to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which suggest the non-
performance of works. If, on the other hand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> were subordinate
to works, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> could on no <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> be dispensed with.--Against the
assertion that Scripture directly declares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to be subordinate

10. (It is) non-comprehensive.

The scriptural declaration does not refer to all meditations, but only
to the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Udgîtha. In the clause 'what he does with
knowledge,' the 'what' is in itself indefinite, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> must be

clause, 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha.' The sentence cannot be
construed to mean 'whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,' but

14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification.

The _or_ has assertive force. The introductory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Upanishad,

15. Some also, by proceeding according to their liking.

In some sâkhâs, moreover, we read that he who possesses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

Bâdarâyana is of opinion that, in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the condition of

since in the section beginning 'there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> branches of sacred duty'
all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are equally referred to, with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to
glorifying him who is firmly grounded in Brahman. The reference there
made to the condition of the householder necessarily presupposes that
condition to be already established and obligatory, and the same
reasoning then holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> with regard to the other conditions mentioned.
Nor must it be said that the special duties mentioned at the beginning
of the section--sacrifice, study, charity, austerity, Brahmakarya--all
of them belong to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of the householder (in which <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

'Sacrifice, &c. are the first, austerity the second, Brahmakarya the

The term 'Brahmasamstha' finally, in the concluding clause, refers to
all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions of life, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> belonging to all those

the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> discussed, although primarily concerned with other topics,
must at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> be viewed as proving the validity of the several
conditions of life. From this it follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoining the
performance of the Agnihotra up to the end of life, and similar texts,
are not universally binding, but concern those only who do not retire

(which does not require the performance of sacrifices and the like), it
is not subordinate to works, but is in itself beneficial to man.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'benefit to man.'




21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their
reference; not so, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the newness.

The following point is next enquired into. Are <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'That
Udgîtha is the best of all essences, the highest, holding the supreme
place, the eighth' (Ch. Up. I, 1, 3) meant to glorify the Udgîtha as a
constituent element of the sacrifice, or to enjoin a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
Udgîtha as the best of all essences, and so on? The Pûrvapakshin holds
the former view, on the ground that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares the Udgîtha to be
the best of all essences in so far as being a constituent element of the
sacrifice. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'the ladle is
this earth, the âhavanîya is the heavenly world,' which are merely meant
to glorify the ladle and the rest as constituent members of the
sacrifice.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the latter part of the Sûtra sets aside 'on
<span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of newness.' Texts, as the one referring to the Udgîtha, cannot
be mere glorifications; for the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the Udgîtha being the best of
essences is not established by any other means of proof, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
under discussion cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be understood as a mere anuvâda, meant
for glorification. Nor is there, in proximity, any injunction of the
Udgîtha on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of connexion with which the clause declaring the
Udgîtha to be the best of all essences could naturally be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> as an
anuvâda (glorifying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> previously enjoined in the injunctive
text); while there is such an injunction in connexion with the (anuvâda)
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'The ladle is this earth,' and so on. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> cannot but arrive at
the conclusion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is meant to enjoin a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the
Udgîtha as being the best of all essences, and so on--the fruit of such
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> being an increase of vigour and efficacy on the part of the
sacrifice.




22. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> denoting becoming.

That the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> under discussion have an injunctive purport also follows
from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that they contain verbal forms denoting becoming or
origination--'he is to meditate' and the like; for all such forms have
injunctive force. All these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are meant to enjoin special
forms of meditation.--Here terminates the adhikarana of mere
glorification.'




23. Should it be said that (the stories told in the Upanishads) are for
the purpose of the Pâriplava; not so, since (certain stories) are
specified.

We meet in the Vedânta-texts with certain stories such as 'Pratardana
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Divodâsa came to the beloved abode of Indra,' &c., and
similar ones. The question here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the stories are merely
meant to be recited at the Asvamedha <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> or to convey <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
a special kind.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains that as the text' they tell
the stories' declares the special connexion of those stories with the so-
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> pâriplava performance, they cannot be assumed to be mainly
concerned with knowledge.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra negatives, on the ground
that not all stories of that kind are specially connected with the
pâriplava. The <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> rather single out special stories only as suitable
for that performance; on the general injunction quoted above there
follows an injunction defining _which_ stories are to be told, 'King
Manu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Vivasvat,' &c. The stories told in the Vedânta-texts do
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> parts of the pâriplava performance, but are connected
with injunctions of meditations.




24. This follows also from the textual connexion (of those stories with
injunctions).

That those stories subserve injunctions of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is proved thereby
also that they are exhibited in textual connexion with injunctions such
as 'the Self is to be seen,' and so on. Their position <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is
analogous to that of other stories told in the texts, which somehow
subserve injunctions of works, and are not merely meant for purposes of
recitation.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the pâriplava.'




25. For this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> there is no need of the lighting of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
and so on.

The Sûtras return, from their digression into the discussion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
special points, to the question as to those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
involves chastity. The above Sûtra declares that as persons of that
class are referred to by Scripture as specially concerned with
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> ('He who is founded on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches immortality;' 'those
who in the forest,' &c.), their <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> does not presuppose a

Agnihotra, the Darsapûrnamâsa, and all those other sacrifices which
require the preliminary establishnlent of the sacred fires, but a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> only which are enjoined for their special
condition of life.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the kindling of
the fire.'




26. And there is need of all (works), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the scriptural
statement of sacrifices and the rest; as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the horse.

If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (meditation), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any reference to sacrifices and the
like, is able to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> about immortality, it must be capable of
accomplishing this in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of householders also; and the mention
made of sacrifices and the rest in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'Brâhmanas seek to know
him by the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts' (Bri. Up. IV, 4,
22), does not prove sacrifices and so on to be auxiliary to knowledge,
since the stress there lies (not on the sacrifices and so on, but) on
the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of knowledge.--Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of householders, for whom the Agnihotra and so on are obligatory,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> presupposes all those works, since scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as
the one quoted directly <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> that sacrifices and the like are auxiliary
to knowledge. 'They seek to know by means of sacrifices' can be said
only if sacrifices are understood to be a means through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about; just as one can say 'he desires to slay with a sword,'
because the sword is admitted to be an instrument wherewith one can kill.
What we have to understand by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in this connexion has been
repeatedly explained, viz. a mental energy different in character from
the mere cognition of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of texts, and more specifically denoted
by such terms as dhyâna or upâsana, i.e. meditation; which is of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of remembrance (i.e. representative thought), but in intuitive
clearness is not inferior to the clearest presentative <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span>
(pratyaksha); which by constant daily practice becomes ever more perfect,
and being duly continued up to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> secures final Release. Such
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is originated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> through the grace of the Supreme
Person, who is pleased and conciliated by the different kinds of acts of
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and worship duly performed by the Devotee <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after day. This
is what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'they seek to know through the sacrifice' really means.
The conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of householders <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
has for its pre-requisite all sacrifices and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of permanent
and occasional obligation. 'As a horse.' As the horse, which is a means
of locomotion for man, requires attendants, grooming, &c., so knowledge,
although itself the means of Release, demands the co-operation of the
different works. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> himself says, 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of sacrifice,
giving, and austerities is not to be relinquished, but is indeed to be
performed; for sacrifices, gifts, and austerities are purifying to the
thoughtful.' 'He from whom all <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> proceed and by whom all this is

(Bha. Gî. XVIII, 5; 46).--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the need
of all.'




27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness, subjection of the
senses, &c., since those are enjoined as auxiliaries to that, and must
necessarily be accomplished.

The question is <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the householder also must practise calmness and
so on, or not. The Pûrvapakshin says he must not, since the performance
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> implies the activity of the outer and inner organs of action,
and since calmness and so on are of an exactly opposite nature.--This
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. The householder also, although engaged in
outward activity, must, in so far as he possesses knowledge, practise
calmness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the rest also; for these qualities or states are by
Scripture enjoined as auxiliaries to knowledge, 'Therefore he who knows
this, having become calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected,
should see the Self in Self (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 23). As calmness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
and the rest are seen, in so far as implying composure and concentration
of mind, to promote the origination of knowledge, they also must
necessarily be aimed at and practised. Nor can it be said that between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> on the one <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> and calmness and so on on the other, there is an
absolute antagonism; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> have different spheres of application.
Activity of the organs of action is the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of

have no definite purpose. Nor also can it be objected that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span>

of the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and its surroundings; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> enjoined by

through his grace, to cause the destruction of all mental impressions
obstructive of calmness and concentration of mind. Hence calmness of

Here terminates the adhikarana of 'calmness' and so on.




28. And there is permission of all <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of danger of life;
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of this being seen.

In the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on prâna, according to the Vâjasaneyins and the
Chândogas, there is a statement as to all <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> being allowed to him who
knows the prâna. 'By him there is nothing eaten that is not food' (Bri.
Up. VI, 1, 14; and so on). A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this permission
of all <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is valid for him who possesses the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of prâna, in

<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of all kinds is permitted even for those who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> itself--
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of which of course is <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than that of prâna--only when
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is in danger. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> alluded to is the one telling how
Ushasta Kâkrâyana, who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> versed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, once,
when in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> distress, ate unlawful food. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that
what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says as to all <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> being lawful for him who knows prâna,
can refer only to occasions when <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of any kind must be eaten in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to preserve life.




29. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of non-sublation.

The conclusion above arrived at is confirmed by the consideration that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> only those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> are not stultified which enjoin, for those who
know Brahman, purity in matters of <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> with a <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> to the origination
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. Cp.' when the <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> is pure the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> becomes
pure' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2).




30. This is said in Smriti also.

That for those as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> who know Brahman, as for others, the eating of
<span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> of any kind is lawful only in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of extreme need, Smriti also
declares, 'He who being in danger of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> eats <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> from anywhere is
stained by <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> no more than the lotus leaf by water.'




31. And hence also a scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> as to non-proceeding according
to liking.

The above conclusion is further confirmed by a scriptural <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span>
prohibiting licence of conduct on the part of any one. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> meant is
a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in the Samhitâ of the Kathas, 'Therefore a Brahmawa does not
drink spirituous liquor, thinking "may I not be stained by sin."'--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'the allowance of all food.'




32. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the âsramas also, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their being enjoined.

It has been said that sacrifices and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are auxiliary to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. The doubt now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are to be
performed by him also who merely wishes to fulfil the duties of his
âsrama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> aiming at final Release, or not. They are not, the
Pûrvapakshin holds, for that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> auxiliary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> should stand
in subordinate relation to a certain <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> imply the
contradiction of permanent and non-permanent obligation.--Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
the Sûtra disposes, 'The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of the âsramas also.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> belonging
to each âsrama have to be performed by those also who do not aim at more
than to live according to the âsrama; for they are specifically enjoined
by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> lasts he is to offer the Agnihotra';
this implies a permanent obligation dependent on life. And that the same
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are also to be performed as being auxiliary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> appears
from the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> enjoining them in that aspect, 'Him they seek to know by
the study of the Veda' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 22); this the next Sûtra
declares.




33. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of co-operativeness.

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are to be performed also on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their being co-
operative towards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in so far, namely, as they give rise to the
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of knowledge; and their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> being enjoined for a double purpose
does not imply contradiction any more than the double injunctions of the
Agnihotra, which one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> connects with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the sacrificer and
another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> with his <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to reach the heavenly world.--Nor does this
imply a difference of works--this the next Sûtra declares.




34. In any <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> they are the same, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of twofold inferential
signs.

There is no radical difference of works; but in any case, i.e. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
they be viewed as duties incumbent on the âsrama or as auxiliary to
knowledge, sacrifices and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are one and the same. For
Scripture, in enjoining them in both these aspects, makes <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the
same terms, so that we recognise the same acts, and there is no means of
proof to establish difference of works.




35. And Scripture also declares (knowledge) not to be overpowered.

<span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> such as 'By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of sacred duty he drives away evil' declare that
sacrifices and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> have the effect of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> 'not being
overpowered,' i.e. of the origination of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> not being obstructed
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> works. Sacrifices and similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> being performed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after

arises in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with ever increasing brightness. This proves that the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are the same in either case.--Here terminates the adhikarana of
'the being enjoined' (of sacrifices, and so on).




36. Also in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those outside, as this is seen.

It has been declared that the members of the four âsramas have a claim
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, and that the duties connected with each
âsrarna promote knowledge. A doubt now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> also who,
on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of poverty and so on, stand outside the âsramas are qualified
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, or rtot.--They are not, the Pûrvapakshin
holds, since such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is to be attained in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> dependent on the
special duties of each âsrama; while those who do not belong to an
âsrama are not concerned with âsrama duties.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra
rejects. Those also who do not stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> any âsrama are qualified for
knowledge, 'because that is seen,' i.e. because the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> declare that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> such as Raikva, Bhîshma, Samvarta and others who did not belong to
âsrama were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> grounded in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. It can by no
means be maintained that it is âsrama duties only that promote knowledge;
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and so on' (Bri. Up. IV,
4, 22) distinctly declares that charity also and other practices, which
are not confined to the âsramas, are helpful towards knowledge. In the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those bound to chastity--who, as the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
show, may possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman--knowledge is promoted by
practices other than the Agnihotra and the like, so--it is concluded--in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those also who do not belong to any abrama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> may be
promoted by certain practices not exclusively connected with any âsrama,
such as prayer, fasting, charity, propitiation of the divinity, and so
on.




37. Smriti also states this.

Smriti also declares that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> not belonging to an âsrama grow in

may become perfect. May he perform other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> or not, one who befriends
all creatures is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Brâhmana' (Manu Smri. II, 17).




38. And there is the promotion (of knowledge) through special acts (of
duty).

The above conclusion is founded not only on Reasoning and Smriti; but
Scripture even directly states that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is benefited by practices
not exclusively prescribed for the âsramas, 'By penance, abstinence,
faith, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> he is to seek the Self (Pr. Up. I, 10).




39. But better than that is the other also on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of an inferential
mark.

Better than to be outside the âsramas is the condition of standing
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> an âsrama. The latter <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> may be due to misfortune; but he who
can should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> an âsrama, which <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is the more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> and
beneficial one. This follows from inference only, i.e. Smriti; for
Smriti says, 'A Brâhmana is to remain outside the âsramas not even for
one day.' For one who has passed beyond the stage of Brahmakarya, or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> wife has died, the impossibility to procure a wife constitutes the
misfortune (which prevents him from belonging to an âsrama).--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'widowers.'




40. But of him who has become that there is no becoming not that,
according to Jaimini also, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of (Scripture) restraining from
the absence of the forms of that.

The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those also who have fallen from the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a Naishthika, Vaikhânasa or Pârivrâjaka are qualified for the

than in that of widowers and the like, the growth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> may be
assisted by charity and other practices not confined to âsramas.--This
primâ facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. 'He who has become that,' i.e. he
who has entered on the condition of a Naishthika or the like 'cannot
become not that,' i.e. may not live in a non-âsrama condition; since
scriptural <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> restrain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who once have entered the Naishthika, &c.,
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> 'from the absence of the forms of that,' i.e. from the
discontinuance of the special duties of their âsrama. Compare <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such
as 'He is to go into the forest, and is not to return from thence';
'Having renounced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he is not to return.' And hence persons who
have lapsed from their âsrama are not qualified for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
Brahman. This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of his the Sûtrakâra strengthens by a reference to
the opinion of Jaimini.--But cannot a Naishthika who, through some sin,
has lapsed from his duties and position, make up for his transgression
by some expiatory act and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> again become fit for <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on
Brahman?--To this point the next Sûtra refers.




41. Nor the (expiatory performance) described in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> treating of
qualification; that being impossible on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Smriti referring
to such lapse.

Those expiatory performances which are described in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> treating
of qualification (Pû. Mî. Sû. VI) are not possible in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of him
who has lapsed from the condition of a Naishthika; since such expiations
do not apply to him, as is shown by a Smriti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> referring to such
lapse, viz. 'He who having once entered on the duties of a Naishthika
lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not see any
expiatory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> by which he might become clean.' The expiatory ceremony
referred to in the Pûrva Mimâmsâ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> applies to the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of other
Brahmakârins only.




42. A minor one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> some; (and hence they hold) the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> (of
expiation), as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of eating. This has been explained.

Some teachers are of opinion that even on the part of Naishthikas and
the rest the lapse from chastity constitutes only a minor offence which
can be atoned for by expiatory observances; in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the eating of forbidden <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> the same prâyaskitta may be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by
the ordinary Brahmakârin and by Naishthikas and the rest. This has been
stated by the Smriti writer, 'For the others also (i.e. the Naishthikas
and so on) the same (rules and practices as those for the Upakurvâna)
hold good, in so far as not opposed to their âsrama.'




43. But in either <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> (such men) stand outside; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of Smriti
and custom.

<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Whether</span> the point under discussion constitutes a minor or a major
offence, in any <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> those who have lapsed stand outside the category of
those qualified for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman. For Smriti, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>
quoted above, 'I see no expiatory performance by which he, a slayer of

powerless to restore purity. And custom confirms the same conclusion;
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> shun those Naishthikas who have lapsed, even after they
have performed prâyaskittas, and do not impart to them the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
Brahman, The conclusion, therefore, is that such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are not qualified
for knowing Brahman.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'him who has
become that.'




44. By the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> (of the sacrifice), since Scripture declares a fruit--

A doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the meditations on such constituent elements of
the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> as the Udgîtha, and so on, are to be performed by the
sacrificer (for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> benefit the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> is offered), or by the
officiating priests. Âtreya advocates the former view; on the ground of
Scripture showing that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such meditations as the one on the
small ether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the heart, fruit and <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> belong to the same
person, and that in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such meditations as the one on the
Udgîtha the fruit belongs to the sacrificer (whence we conclude that the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> also is his). Nor can it be said that the sacrificer is not
competent for such meditation, for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that like the godohana
vessel it is connected with an element of the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> (which latter
the priests only can perform). For the godohana vessel serves to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span>
water, and this of course none else can do but the Adhvaryu; while a
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Udgîtha as being the essence of all essences can very
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be performed by the Sacrificer--true <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it be that the Udgîtha
itself can be performed by the Udgâtri priest only.--Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span>
the next Sûtra declares itself.




45. (They are) the priest's work, Audulomi thinks; since for that he is
engaged.

The teacher Audulomi is of opinion that the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the Udgîtha
and the like is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the priest, since it is he who is engaged
for the purpose of performing that which gives rise to the fruit, i.e.
of the entire <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> with all its subordinate parts. Injunctions
referring to the performance of the sacrifices such as 'he chooses the
priests; he gives to the priests their fee' indicate that the entire
sacrificial performance is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the priests, and that hence all
activities comprised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it--mental as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as bodily--belong to the
priests. Capability or non-capability does not constitute the criterion
in this case. For although the meditations in question aim directly at
the benefit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (not at the greater perfection of the sacrifice), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

qualified for the sacrifice, and since the <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> with all its
subordinate elements has to be performed by the priests, and since the

benefited by such knowledge, we conclude that those meditations also are
the exclusive duty of the priests. In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the meditations on the
small ether, &c., on the other hand, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says nothing as to their
having to be performed by priests, and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> assume in accordance
with the general principle that 'the fruit belongs to the performer,'
that the agent there is the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to whom Scripture assigns the fruit.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> (of the sacrifice).'




46. There is injunction of other auxiliary means for him who is such, as
in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of injunction and so on; (the term _mauna_ denoting)

'Therefore let a Brâhmana after he has done with learning wish to stand
by a childlike state; and after having done with the childlike <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> and
learning (he is) a Muni' (Bri. Up. III, 5). A doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this

The Purvapakshin holds the latter <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> on the ground that as 'Muni-hood'
and 'learning' both connote knowledge, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'Muni' merely refers

as 'learning'--this the Sûtra intimates by the clause 'alternatively a

power, we must all the same understand it in an injunctive sense, viz.
'then let him be or become a Muni'; for Muni-hood is not something
previously established. Such munihood is also something different from
mere _reflection_ (manana); it is the reiterated representation before

belonging exclusively to the condition of the wandering beggar, and then
the subsequent clause 'therefore let a Brâhmana having done with

The injunction, on him who has passed beyond all desire, of mauna
preceded by pârivrâjya (wandering about as a mendicant), is meant to
illustrate the duties of all âsramas. For the duties of the other
âsramas are taught by Scripture no less than those of the Muni (and the
householder). Similarly it was shown above that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'There are

50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as
this is seen.

Knowledge, as enjoined by Scripture, is twofold, having for its fruit
either exaltation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the sphere of the Samsâra, or final Release.
With regard to the former the question arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it springs up only
immediately subsequent to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> which are the means to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> it

'Four kinds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> doing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> worship me,' &c.(Bha. Gî. VII, 16);
and when those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> have been accomplished there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why the
result, i.e. knowledge, should be delayed.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes
of. 'What is comprised in this world,' i.e. meditation, the result of
which is worldly exaltation, springs up immediately after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> to
which it is due, in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of there being no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of greater
strength obstructing the rise of knowledge; but if there is an
obstruction of the latter kind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> springs up later on only. 'For
this is seen,' i.e. Scripture acknowledges the effects of such
obstruction; for a statement such as 'what he does with knowledge, with
faith, with the Upanishad that is more vigorous,' means that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>

'what belongs to this world.'




51. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> there is non-determination with regard to what has
Release for its result; that condition being ascertained, that condition
being ascertained.

So likewise in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the origination, through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

is not definitely fixed; for here also there is ascertained the same
condition, viz. the termination of the obstruction presented by other
works. A further doubt might in this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> be raised on the ground that
such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> as give rise to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> leading to final Release are

But this doubt is disposed of by the reflection that even in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> there may exist previous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deeds of

of 'what has Release for its result.'




FOURTH ADHYÂYA

FIRST PÂDA.

1. Repetition, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> teaching (what has to be done more
than once).

The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> adhyâya was concerned with the consideration of meditation,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with its means. The Sûtras now enter on a consideration of the
results of meditation, after a further preliminary clearing up of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of meditation. The question here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the act of

death,' 'He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman,' is, in the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of
Scripture, to be performed once only, or to be repeated more than once.--
Once suffices, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; for as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> enjoins
nothing more than knowing there is no authority for a repetition of the
act. Nor can it be said that the act of knowing, analogous to the act of
beating the rice-grains until they are freed from the husks, is a
visible means towards effecting the intuition of Brahman, and hence must,
like the beating, be repeated until the effect is accomplished; for
knowing is not a visible means towards anything. Such acts as the
Jyotishtoma <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> inculcated in the Vedânta-texts
are alike of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of conciliation of the Supreme Person; through
whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> conciliated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> obtains all that is beneficial to him, viz.
religious duty, wealth, pleasure, and final Release. This has been shown
under III, 2, 38. The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of Scripture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is accomplished by
performing the act of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> once only, as the Jyotishtoma is
performed once.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of

teaching,' i.e. because the teaching of Scripture is conveyed by means
of the term 'knowing' (vedana), which is synonymous with meditating
(dhyâna, upâsana). That these terms are so synonymous appears from the
<span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the verbs vid, upâs, dhyâi are in one and the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span>
with reference to one and the same <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of knowledge. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> begins, e.

who knows (veda) this shines, warms,' &c. (Ch. Up. III, 18). In the same

by means of upâs,'teach me the deity on which you meditate' (Ch. Up. IV,

dhyâi means to think of something not in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of mere representation

same meaning; for we see it <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of thinking with
uninterrupted concentration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> on one object.

conclude that as the verb 'vid' is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> interchangeably with dhyâi and
upâs, the mental activity referred to in <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'he knows
Brahman' and the like is an often-repeated continuous representation.

next Sûtra disposes of.




5. The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of Brahman, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of superiority.

The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> may appropriately be superimposed on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the
like; but not the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of mind, and so on, on Brahman. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
something superior to mind, and so on; while the latter are inferior to
Brahman. To <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> a superior person, a prince e.g., as a servant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
lowering; while, on the other hand, to <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> a servant as a prince is
exalting.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'symbols.'




6. And the ideas of Âditya and the rest on the member; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
this being rational.

'He who shines up there let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on him as the Udgîtha' (Ch.
Up. I, 3, 1).--With regard to this and similar meditations connected
with subordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the
doubt <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the idea of Âditya and so on has to be superimposed on the
subordinate part of the sacrifice, such as the Udgîtha, or vice versâ (i.
e. <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Âditya should be meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> under the aspect of the
Udgîtha, or vice versâ).--The Pûrvapakshin holds the former view. For
the general principle is that the lower being should be viewed under the
aspect of the higher, and the Udgîtha and so on, which are parts of the
sacrifices through which certain results are effected, are superior to
the divinities who do not accomplish any result.--Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra
disposes. The ideas of Âditya and so on are to be superimposed on the
'members,' i.e. the Udgîtha and so on, which are constituent members of
the sacrifices; because of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> only superiority can be established.
For it is only through the propitiation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> that sacrifices are
capable of bringing about their results. The Udgîtha and the rest
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> are to be viewed under the aspect of Âditya and so on.--Here
terminates the adhikarana of 'the ideas of Âditya and so on.'




7. Sitting; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of possibility.

It has been shown that that special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of cognitional activity which
the Vedânta-texts <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth as the means of accomplishing final Release
and which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> (dhyâna; upâsana) has to be frequently
repeated, and is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of continued representation. A question
now arises as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which it has to be carried on.--There being
no special restrictive rule, the Pûrvapakshin holds that the Devotee may
carry it on either sitting or lying down or standing or walking.--This
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. <span class="t25 hoverable">Meditation</span> is to be carried on by the Devotee
in a sitting posture, since in that posture only the needful
concentration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> can be reached. Standing and walking demand effort,
and lying down is conducive to sleep. The proper posture is sitting on
some support, so that no effort may be required for holding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> up.




8. And on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of meditation.

Since, as intimated by the text,'the Self is to be meditated upon,' the
mental activity in question is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of meditation, it requires
as its necessary condition concentration of mind. For by <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is
understood <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> directed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> one <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> and not disturbed by the
ideas of other things.




9. And with reference to immobility.

And it is with reference to their immobility that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and other
inanimate things--the air, the sky, the waters, the mountains--may be
spoken of as thinking, 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> thinks (dhyâyati) as it were,' and so
on. Movelessness hence is characteristic of the intensely meditating
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> also, and such movelessness is to be realised in the sitting
posture only.




10. And Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> say the same.

Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> also declare that he only who sits can meditate, 'Having
placed his steady seat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a pure spot, there seated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> that seat,
concentrating his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> he should practise Yoga' (Bha. Gî. VI, 11-12).




11. Where concentration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> (is possible), there; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of
there being no difference.

As the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> do not say anything as to special places and times, the
only requisite of such places and times is that they should favour
concentration of mind. This agrees with the declaration 'Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> apply
himself to <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in a level and clean place, &c., favourable to the
mind' (Svet. Up. II, 10).--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the
sitting one.'




12. Up to death; for there also it is seen.

The question now arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> described which is the
means of final Release is to be accomplished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> one day, or to be
continued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after day, until death.--The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that it is accomplished
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> one day, as this will satisfy the scriptural injunction, is
disposed of by the Sûtra. <span class="t25 hoverable">Meditation</span> is to be continued until death. For
Scripture declares that <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> has to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> 'there,' i.e. in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> period from the first effort after <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> up to death,
'Acting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> lasts he reaches the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Brahman.'--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'up to death.'




13. On the attainment of this, there result the non-clinging and the
destruction of later and earlier sins; this being declared.

Having, so far, elucidated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of meditation, the Sûtras now
begin to consider the result of meditation. Scripture declares that on
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> being attained a man's later and earlier sins
do not cling to him but <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> away. 'As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> does not cling to a lotus
leaf, so no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deed clings to him who knows this' (Ch. Up. IV, 14, 3);
'Having known that he is not sullied by any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deed' (Bri. Up. IV, 4,
23); 'As the fibres of the Ishîkâ reed when thrown into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> are
burnt, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> all his sins are burnt' (Ch. Up. V, 24, 3); 'All his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span>
perish when He has been beheld who is <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> and low' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8).--
The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this non-clinging and destruction of all
sins is possible as the result of mere meditation, or not.--It is not
possible, the Pûrvapakshin maintains; for Scripture declares, 'no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
the fruits of which have not been completely enjoyed perishes even in
millions of aeons.' What the texts, quoted above, say as to the non-
clinging and destruction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> occurs in sections complementary to
passages inculcating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as the means of final Release, and may

it be said that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is enjoined as an expiation of sins, so that
the destruction of sins could be conceived as resulting from such
expiation; for knowledge--as we see from <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as 'He who knows
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> reaches the Highest,' 'He knows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and he becomes Brahman'--
is enjoined as a means to reach Brahman. The <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> as to the non-

<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">SECOND</span> PÂDA.

1. Speech with mind, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of this being seen and of scriptural
statement.

The Sûtras now begin an enquiry into the mode of the going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of
him who knows. At first the soul's departure from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is considered.
On this point we have the text, 'When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> departs from hence his
speech is combined (sampadyate) with his mind, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with his breath,
his breath with fire, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> deity' (Ch. Up. VI, 6, 1).
The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the speech's being combined with the mind,
referred to in the text, means that the function of speech only is
merged in mind, or the organ of speech itself.--The Pûrvapakshin holds
the former view; for, he says, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is not the causal substance of
speech, the latter cannot be merged in it; while the scriptural
statement is not altogether irrational in so far as the functions of
speech and other organs are controlled by the mind, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> may be
conceived as being withdrawn into it.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside.
Speech itself becomes combined with mind; since that is seen. For the
activity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is observed to go on even when the organ of speech has
ceased to act.--But is this not sufficiently accounted for by the
assumption of the mere function of speech being merged in mind?--To this
the Sûtra replies 'and on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the scriptural word.' The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says
distinctly that speech itself, not merely the function of speech,
becomes one with the mind. And when the function of speech comes to an
end, there is no other means of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to assure us that the function
only has come to an end and that the organ itself continues to have an
independent existence. The objection that speech cannot become one with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> because the latter is not the causal substance of speech, we meet
by pointing out that the purport of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is not that speech is
merged in mind, but only that it is combined or connected with it.




2. And for the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> all follow after.

Because speech's becoming one with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> means only conjunction with the
latter, not merging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it; there is also no objection to what
Scripture says as to all other organs that follow speech being united
with mind.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'speech.'




3. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in breath, owing to the subsequent clause.

That mind, i.e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> united with all the organs unites itself with
breath; not merely the function of mind. This appears from the clause
following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> quoted above, 'mind (unites itself) with breath.'
Here, however, a further doubt suggests itself. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'Mind is made
of earth' declares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to be the causal substance of mind, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'that (viz. water) sent forth earth' declares <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to be the
causal substance of earth; while the further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'breath is made of
water' shows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to be the causal substance of breath. Considering
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'mind becomes united with breath' the term
_breath_ is naturally understood to denote the causal substance of
breath, i.e. water, the appropriate <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> to be given to the statement
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is united with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is completely refunded into
its own causal substance--so that the 'being united' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> throughout be
understood 'as being completely merged.'--The reply to this, however,
is, that the clauses 'Mind is made of food, breath is made of water,'
only mean that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and breath are nourished and sustained by <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and
water, not that <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> are the causal substances of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and
breath. The latter indeed is impossible; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> consists of ahamkâra,
and as breath is a modification of ether and other elements, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
_breath_ may suggest water.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'mind.'




4. That (is united) with the ruler, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the going to it, and
so on.

As from the statements that speech becomes united with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
with breath it follows that speech and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> are united with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and
breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent clause 'breath with
fire' that breath becomes united with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> only.--Against this primâ
facie <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra declares 'that breath becomes united with the ruler
of the organs, i.e. the individual soul, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the going to it,
and so on.' That breath goes to the individual soul, the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

departure of prâna <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the soul, 'after him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> departing the

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'breath with

with fire. Analogously we may say in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that the Yamuna is
flowing towards the sea, while in reality it is the Yamuna joined with
the Gangâ which flows on.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'the ruler.'




5. With the elements, this being stated by Scripture.

There arises the further question <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> breath joined with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
unites itself with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> only or with all the elements combined.--With
fire, so much only being declared by Scripture!--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra
sets aside. Breath and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> unite themselves with all the elements; for
Scripture declares the soul, when moving out, to consist of all the
elements--'Consisting of earth, consisting of water, consisting of fire.
'--But this latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> explains itself also on the assumption of breath
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> unitrng themselves in succession with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and the rest, one at
a time!--This the next Sûtra negatives.




6. Not with one; for both declare this.

Not with one; because each element by itself is incapable of producing

alike.

Up. VI, 3) teaches that the elements were rendered tripartite in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span>
to be capable of evolving names and forms; and of similar import is the
following Smriti text, 'Possessing various powers these (elements),
being separate from one another, were unable to produce creatures

the Mahat down to individual beings, produce the Brahma egg.' From this
it follows that in the clause 'breath is united with fire' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> _fire_

adhikarana of 'the elements.'




7. And it is common up to the beginning of the way; and the immortality
(is that which is obtained), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having burned.

Is this departure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> common to him who knows and him who does
not know?--It belongs to him only who does not know, the Pûrvapakshin
holds. For Scripture declares that for him who knows there is no
departure, and that hence he becomes immortal then and there
(irrespective of any departure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to another place), 'when all

becomes immortal, then he obtains Brahman' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 7). This
<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra sets aside. For him also who knows there is the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

'there are a hundred and one veins of the heart; one of them penetrates
the crown of the head; moving upwards by that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> reaches immortality,
the others serve for departing in different directions' (Ch. Up. VIII, 6,
5). Scripture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> declaring that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows passes out

<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out; and as up to the soul's entering the vein no difference is
mentioned, we must assume that up to that moment the departure of him
who knows does not differ from that of him who does not know. A
difference however is stated with regard to the stage of the soul's
entering the vein, viz. Bri. Up. IV, 4, 2, 'By that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> the Self

the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> must be understood to belong to him who knows, while the other
modes of departing belong to other persons. The last clause of the Sûtra
'and the immortality, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having burned' replies to what the
Pûrvapakshin said as to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows being declared by
Scripture to attain to immortality then and there. The immortality
referred to in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'when all desires of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> are undone'
denotes that non-clinging and destruction of earlier and later sins
which comes to him who knows, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with the rise of knowledge,

8. Since, up to the union with that (i.e. Brahman) the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> describe
the Samsâra state.

The immortality referred to must necessarily be understood as not
implying dissolution of the soul's connexion with the body, since up to
the soul's attaining to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> describe the Samsâra state.
That attaining to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> takes place, as will be shown further on,
after the soul--moving on the path the first stage of which is light--
has reached a certain place. Up to that the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> denote the Samsâra
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of which the connexion with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is characteristic. 'For him
there is delay so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he is not delivered (from the body); then he
will be united' (Ch. Up. VI, 14, 2); 'Shaking off all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> as a horse
shakes his hairs, and as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Râhu;

9. And the subtle (body persists), on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of a means of knowledge,
it being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> observed (in Scripture).

The bondage of him who knows is not, at that stage, dissolved, for this
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also that the subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> continues to persist.--How is this
known?--Through a means of knowledge, viz. because it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> seen in
Scripture. For Scripture states that he who knows, when on the path of
the gods, enters into a colloquy with the moon and others, 'he is to
reply,' &c. (Kau. Up. I, 3 ff.). This implies the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of a body,
and thence it follows that, at that stage, the subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> persists. The
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> dissolved.




10. Hence not in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of destruction of bondage.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> appears that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'when all desires which once entered his

Brahman' (Bri. Up. IV, 4, 7), does not mean such immortality as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
imply complete destruction of the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of bondage.




11. And to that very (subtle body) (there belongs) the warmth, this only
being reasonable.

It is observed that when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is about to die there is some warmth <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span>
in some part or parts of the gross body. Now this warmth cannot really
belong to the gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why it should be limited to some
part); but it may reasonably be attributed to the subtle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which may
abide in some part of the gross <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (and into which the warmth of the

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> conclude that this
partial perception of warmth is due to the departing subtle body. This
confirms the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> laid down in Sûtra 7.--The next Sûtra disposes of a
further doubt raised as to the departure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows.




12. If it be said that on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the denial (it is not so); we deny
this. From the embodied soul; for (that one is) clear, according to some.

The contention that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows departs from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in

expressly negatives such departure. For Bri. Up. IV, 4, at first
describes the mode of departure on the part of him who does not possess

Sûtra rejects. 'Not so; from the embodied soul.' What those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> deny
is the moving away of the prânas from the embodied individual soul, not
from the body. 'Of him (tasya) the prânas do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> forth'--here the
'of him' refers to the subject under discussion, i.e. the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

The sixth <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> (tasya)
here denotes the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as that which is connected with the

not as that from which the passing out takes its start.--But why should
the 'tasya' not denote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as the point of starting ('the prânas
do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> forth from that (tasya), viz. the body')?--Because, we reply,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which is actually mentioned in its relation of connexion with
the prânas (as indicated by tasya) suggests itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> more
immediately than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which is not mentioned at all; if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
the question arises as to the starting-point of the passing forth of the

starting-point also (i.e. the clause 'the prânas of him do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
forth' implies at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> 'the prânas do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> forth from him,
i.e. from the soul'). Moreover, as the prânas are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known to be

that connexion, we conclude that the sixth <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> which expresses
connexion in general is here meant to denote the starting-point in
particular. And no dispute on this point is really possible; since
'according to some' it is 'clear' that what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> means to express is
the embodied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as the starting-point of the prânas. The _some_ are
the Mâdhyandinas, who in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Brihad-âranyaka read 'na
tasmât prâna utkrâmanti'--'the prânas do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> forth _from _him' (the

objection is raised, there is no motive for explicitly negativing the
passing away of the prânas from the soul; for there is no <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> to
assume that there should be such a passing away (and the general rule is
that a denial is made of that only for which there is a presumption).--
Not so, we reply. The Chândogya-text 'For him there is delay only as

Smriti also declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows departs by means of

14. With the Highest; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it says.

It has been shown that at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of departure from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

knows forms an exception has been disposed of. The further question now
arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> those subtle elements move on towards producing their
appropriate effects, in accordance with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

themselves), or unite themselves with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self.--The
Pûrvapakshin holds that, as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of union with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self,
they could not give rise to their peculiar effects, i.e. the experience
of pleasure and pain, they move towards some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where they can give
rise to their appropriate effects.--Of this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra disposes.
They unite themselves with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self; for Scripture declares
'warmth in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being' (Ch. Up. VI, 8, 6). And the doings of
those elements must be viewed in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to agree with Scripture.
As in the states of deep sleep and a pralaya, there is, owing to union
with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, a cessation of all experience of pain and
pleasure; so it is in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> under question also.--Here terminates the
adhikarana of 'union with the Highest.'




15. Non-division, according to statement.

Is this union with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self to be understood as ordinary
'merging,' i.e. a return on the part of the effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> into the
condition of the cause (as when the jar is reduced to the condition of a
lump of clay), or as absolute non-division from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self, such
as is meant in the clauses preceding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> last quoted, 'Speech is
merged in mind'? &c.--The former <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is to be adopted; for as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self is the causal substance of all, union with it means the
return on the part of individual <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> into the condition of that
causal substance.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra rejects. Union here means non-
division, i.e. connexion of such kind that those subtle elements are
altogether incapable of being <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and spoken of as separate from
Brahman. This the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> itself declares, since the clause 'warmth in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Being' is connected with and governed by the preceding clause
'Speech is merged in mind.' This preceding clause intimates a special
kind of connexion, viz. absolute non-separation, and there is nothing to
prove that the dependent clause means to express something different;
nor is there any <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the soul's departure those
elements should enter into the causal condition; nor is there anything
said about their again proceeding from the causal substance in a new
creation.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'non-separation.'




16. A lighting up of the point of the abode of that; having the door
illuminated by that (the soul), owing to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and

So far it has been shown that, up to the beginning of the journey, the
souls of them as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> who possess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> as of those who do not,
<span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the same way. Now a difference is stated in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those who have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge. We have on this point the
following text: 'There are a hundred and one arteries of the heart; one
of them penetrates the crown of the head; moving upwards by that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>

directions' (Ch. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> he who
knows departs by this hundred and first artery in the top of the head,
while those who do not know depart by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the other arteries; or
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> there is no definite rule on this point.--There is no definite
rule, the Pûrvapakshin holds. For as the arteries are many and
exceedingly minute, they are difficult to distinguish, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

different arteries being followed by different souls, but) merely refers
in an informal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to what is already settled (viz. by the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of the

Owing to this the abode of that, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> which is the abode of

17. Following the rays.

Scripture teaches that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who knows, after having passed

as there are none. For in summer the experience of heat at night-time
shows that there are present rays then also; while in winter, as
generally in bad weather, that heat is overpowered by cold and hence is
not perceived (although actually present). Scripture moreover states
that the arteries and rays are at all times mutually connected: 'As a

18. Should it be said, not in the night; we say, no; because the
connexion persists as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does. Scripture also declares
this.

It is now enquired into <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of him who, while having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
knowledge, dies at night reaches <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or not. Although, as solar rays
exist at night, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may move on at night also following those rays;
yet, since dying at night is spoken of in the Sûtras as highly
objectionable, we conclude that he who dies at night cannot accomplish
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> end of man, viz. attainment to Brahman. The Sûtras eulogize
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> occurring in daytime and <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> at night-time: 'Day-time,

excellent for those about to die; the contrary times are unfavourable.'
According to this, their different nature, dying in day-time may be
assumed to lead to a superior <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of existence, and dying at night to
an inferior state. He who dies at night cannot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> ascend to

knows, the connexion with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> exists as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> does.'

is to say--since those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> which have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> begun to produce their

19. For the same <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> also during the southern progress of the sun.

The reasoning stated above also proves that the owner of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
who may happen to die during the southern progress of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> reaches
Brahman. A further doubt, however, arises here. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'He who dies
during the sun's southern progress reaches the greatness of the Fathers
and union with the moon' (Mahânâr. Up. 25) declares that he who dies
during the southern progress reaches the moon; and the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'when
this ceases they return again the same way' (Bri. Up. VI, 2, 16) states
that he returns again to the earth. We further know that Bhîshma and
others, although fully possessing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Brahman, put off
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> until the beginning of the northern progress. All this seems
to prove that he who dies during the southern progress does not reach
Brahman.--This doubt we dispose of as follows. Those only who do not
possess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> return from the moon; while he who has such

complementary clause in the Mahânârâyana Up., 'from there he reaches the
greatness of Brahman,' shows that the abode in the moon forms for him,
who having died during the southern progress wishes to reach Brahman, a
mere stage of rest. And even if there were no such complementary passage,
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> follow from the previously stated absence of any <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> for
bondage that the going of the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the moon in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

1. On the path beginning with light, that being known.

The Sûtras now go on to determine the road which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span>

Now of that road
various accounts are given in Scripture. There is a detailed <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> in
the Chândogya. (IV, 15), 'now <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> perform obsequies for him

Upanishad, 'then he moves upwards by those very rays' (VIII, 6, 5).

The Kaushîtakins again give a different account: 'He having reached the
path of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Gods</span> comes to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Agni,' &c. (Kau. Up. I, 3).
Different again in the Brihad-âranyaka: 'Those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> know this and
those who in the forest meditate on <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and the True,' &c. (Bri. Up.
VI, 2, 15). The same Upanishad, in another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (V, 10), gives a
different account: 'When the <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> goes away from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he comes
to the wind,' &c.--A doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> all these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> mean to
give instruction as to one and the same road--the first stage of which
is light--having to be followed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> man; or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span>
they describe different roads on any of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> may proceed.--The
Pûrvapakshin holds the latter view; for he says the roads described
differ in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and are independent one of the other.--This <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the
Sûtra disposes of. All <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> mean one and the same road only, viz. the
one beginning with light, and the souls proceed on that road only. For
that road is known, i.e. is recognised in all the various descriptions,
although it is, in different texts, described with more or less fulness.
We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> have to proceed here as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the details (guna)
which are mentioned in different meditations referring to one and the
same object, i.e. we have to combine the details mentioned in different
places into one whole. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Châandogya-texts--the one in the
Upakosalavidyâ and the one in the Vidyâ of the five fires--describe
exactly the same road. And in the Vidyâ of the five fires as given in
the Brihad-âranyaka the same road, beginning with light, is also
described, although there are differences in minor points; we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
recognise the road described in the Chândogya. And in the other <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span>
also we everywhere recognise the divinities of certain stages of the
road, Agni, Âditya, and so on.--Here terminates the adhikarana of 'that
which begins with light.'

4. Conductors, this being indicated.

The decision here is that light, Vâyu, and the rest mentioned in the

lightning, 'There is a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> not human, he leads them to Brahman.' What
here is said as to that <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> not human, viz. that he leads the soul,
is to be extended to the other <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> also, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and the rest.--But if

6. (Him who meditates on) the effected Brahman, (thus opines) Bâdari;
because for him going is possible.

The following question now presents itself for consideration. Does the
troop of conducting divinities, <span class="t4 t6 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Agni</span> and the rest, lead on those who
meditate on the effected Brahman, i.e. Hiranyagarbha; or those only who
meditate on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman; or those who meditate on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and those who meditate on the individual Self as having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

on those only who meditate on the effected Brahman. For he only who
meditates on Hiranyagarbha can move; while a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> meditating on the

the conducting deities, beginning with Light, leads the souls of those
only who meditate on the effected Brahman, i e. Hiranyagarbha.

the alleged impossibility of the soul's going is no such valid reason;

clearly points to the effected Brahman, i.e. Hiranyagarbha, is equally
invalid. For the compound 'the Brahman-world' is to be explained as'the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which is Brahman'; just as according to the Pûrva Mîmâmsâ the
compound 'Nishâda-sthapati' denotes a sthapati who is a Nishâda (not a

be designated by a plural form, as in a mantra one girdle is spoken of

on the authority of Scripture, Smriti, Itihâsa, and Purâna, that the
wonderful worlds springing from the mere will of a perfect and
omnipresent being cannot be but infinite.

manifests itself in its own shape' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3).--Against the
contention that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> 'I enter the hall of Prajâpati, the house'
shows that he who proceeds on the path beginning with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> aims at the
effected Brahman, the next Sûtra argues.




13. And there is no aiming at the effected (Brahman).

The aim of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not at Hiranyagarbha, but at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
itself. For the complementary sentence 'I am the glorious among
Brâhmanas' shows that what the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> aims at is the condition of the
universal Self, which has for its antecedent the putting off of all
Nescience. For this appears from the preceding text, 'As a horse shakes
his hairs and as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Râhu; having
shaken off the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> may I obtain--the uncreated Brahman-world' declares
that the Brahman-world, which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> to be reached, is something
non-created, and explicitly states that reaching that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> implies
freedom from all bondage whatsoever.--It is for these reasons that
Jaimini holds that the deities speeding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> on its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> lead on him
only who has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of his meditation.




Now the Reverend Bâdarâyana declares his own view, which constitutes the
final conclusion in this matter.

14. Those not depending on symbols he leads, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Bâdarâyana thinks;
there being a defect in both cases; and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> is that.

Bâdarâyana is of opinion that the deities lead those not depending on
symbols, i.e. all meditating devotees other than those depending on
symbols. That is to say, the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that those are led who meditate on the
effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> cannot be upheld; nor is there an exclusive rule that
those only should be led on who meditate on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. The
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is that those are led who meditate on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman, and
also those who meditate on the Self (soul) as different from <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span>
(Prakriti) and having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Self. Souls of both these
kinds are led on to Brahman. Those on the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of

of Brahman, just as some valiant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may be viewed under the aspect of a
lion (which <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> expresses itself in the judgment 'Devadatta is a lion
'); or by themselves (without reference to Brahman)--all those are not
led on to Brahman. Why so?' Because there is a defect in both cases,' i.
e. in both the views rejected by Bâdarâyana. The <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> that those are led
who meditate on the effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is in conflict with <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> such as

meditation. This argument is founded on the text, 'According to what his

departed this life' (Ch. Up. III, 14), which implies the principle that
what a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> attains is according to its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> and
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> in this life; and moreover we have direct scriptural
statements to the effect that those who possess the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the

on that path reach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and do not return. Analogous reasoning proves
that <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> and having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> for

In the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of those,
on the other hand, who rely on the symbols (in which they meditatively
contemplate Brahman), beginning with name and terminating with prâna.
('He who meditates on name as Brahman,' Ch. Up. VII, 1 ff.), the
<span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is not proved by <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds previously mentioned
to lead to Brahman; it rather is contaminated by an element not of the

result of a <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> is the same in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as the <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> itself--

proceed by the path of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and does not reach Brahman.--That this
distinction is declared by Scripture itself, the next Sûtra shows.




15. And Scripture declares the difference.

The text, 'He who meditates on name as Brahman, for him there is
movement as he wishes as far as name extends,' &c. (Ch. Up. VII, 1 ff.),
declares that those who meditate on the series of symbols beginning with
name and ending with prâna attain to a result of limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and not
depending on any particular path. Those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> who meditate on the
Intelligent either as mixed with the Non-intelligent or by itself,

Brahman, are not led on by the conducting deities. On the other hand, it
remains a settled conclusion that the deities speed on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> those

manifestation; (as we infer) from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> 'own.'

The Sûras now proceed to consider the _kind_ of superior <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span>
(aisvarya) which the released souls enjoy.--The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> says, 'Thus does
that serene being, having risen from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and having approached the

Does this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> mean that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> having approached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>

On this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the term 'accomplishes itself is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> in its direct sense,
and the expression 'in its own shape' also is suitable in so far as the

by the specification implied in the term 'own,' in the phrase 'in its

the final release, i.e. the cessation of all bondage, which is gained by
the soul, previously connected with Karman, as soon as it approaches the

3. The Self, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of subject-matter.

The subject-matter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> section shows that by the Self
manifesting itself in its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> there is meant the Self as possessing
the attributes of freedom from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and so on. For the
teaching of Prajâpati begins as follows: 'the Self which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from
sin, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from old age, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> and grief, from hunger and thirst,

this Self which forms the subject-matter of the entire section is the
individual Self we have shown under I, 3, 19. The manifestation of the

the manifestation of that Self which has freedom from <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and so on for
its essential attributes-that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> being in the Samsâra <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> obscured

essential qualities assert themselves, the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is one of manifestation
of what already exists, not one of origination. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the reverend

essential qualities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which were obscured and contracted by

<span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of 'manifestation' there remains no difficulty.--Here terminates
the adhikarana of 'on approaching manifestation.'




4. In non-division; because that is seen.

Is the soul, when it has reached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and freed itself from

non-separate in so far as being a mere 'mode' (prakâra) of that Self?--
The former <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> is the right one. For Scriptural and Smriti <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> alike
declare that the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> stands to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self in the
relation of fellowship, equality, equality of attributes, and all this
implies <span class="t1 t7 t9 t12 t14 t19 t29 hoverable">consciousness</span> of separation. Compare 'He attains all desires

III, 1, 3); 'Taking their stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> they, attaining to

2).--Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra declares itself 'in non-division.' The
released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is conscious of itself as non-divided from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
Brahman. 'For this is seen,' i.e. for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> having reached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

for their inner Self the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Self while they constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of
that Self and hence are _modes_ (prakâra) of it. This is proved by all
those <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> which exhibit the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in co-ordination--'Thou

5. In (a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> like) that of Brahman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Jaimini thinks; on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span>
of suggestion and the rest.

Owing to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that different <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> give different accounts, the
question now arises of what character that essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self
is in which it manifests itself on reaching Brahman. Is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
constituted by freedom from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and the rest (i.e. the
attributes enumerated Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1); or by mere <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
(vijñâna); or by both, there being no opposition between <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span>
and those other attributes?--The teacher Jaimini holds that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
manifests itself in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> character, i.e. in a character
constituted by freedom from sin, and so on. These latter attributes are,
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the 'small lotus,' mentioned as belonging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> (Ch.
Up. VIII, 1, 5), and may hence be referred to as the 'Brahman' character.
And that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> character is the character of the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
also follows from 'suggestion and the rest.' For freedom from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
and the rest are, in the teaching of Prajâpati, referred to as
attributes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (VIII, 7, 1). The 'and the rest' of the Sûtra
refers to the activities of the released soul--laughing, playing,
rejoicing, and so on (mentioned in VIII, 12, 3)--which depend on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> to realise all its ideas and
wishes. It is for these reasons that Jaimini holds that mere
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> does not constitute the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the released soul.




6. In the sole <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of intelligence; as that is its Self. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
Audulomi thinks.

<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">Intelligence</span> (consciousness; kaitanya) alone is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
soul, and hence it is in that character only that the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
manifests itself; this is the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the teacher Audulomi. That
<span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> only constitutes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> being of the soul, we learn from
the express statement 'As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside,
but is altogether a mass of taste; so this Self has neither inside nor
outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (Bri. Up. IV, 5, 13).
When, therefore, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> attributes to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> freedom from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and
the rest, it does not mean to predicate of it further positive qualities,
but only to exclude all the qualities depending on avidyâ--change,
pleasure, pain, and so on--For these reasons Audulomi holds that the
released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> manifests itself as mere intelligence.--Next the teacher
Bâdarâyana determines the question by propounding his own view.




7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> also, on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the former qualities (as
proved) by suggestion, Bâdarayana holds absence of contradiction.

The teacher Bâdarâyana is of opinion that even thus, i.e. although the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to have mere <span class="t14 t24 hoverable">intelligence</span> for its essential
nature, all the same the previously stated attributes, viz. freedom from
all sin, and so on, are not to be excluded. For the authority of a
definite statement in the Upanishads proves them to exist ('That Self
which is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin,' &c.); and of authorities of equal strength one
cannot refute the other. Nor must you say that the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is one of
essential contradiction, and that hence we necessarily must conclude
that freedom from sin, and so on (do not belong to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the soul, but) are the mere figments of Nescience (from which the
released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is free). For as there is equal authority for both sides,
why should the contrary <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> not be held? (viz. that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is
essentially <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from sin, &c., and that the kaitanya is non-essential.)
For the principle is that where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> statements rest on equal authority,
that only which suffers from an intrinsic impossibility is to be
interpreted in a different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> (i.e. different from what it means on the
face of it), so as not to conflict with the other. But while admitting
this we deny that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which describes the Self as a mass of mere
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> implies that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Self comprises nothing whatever
but knowledge.--But what then is the purport of that text?--The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
is clear, we reply; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> teaches that the entire Self, different
from all that is non-sentient, is self-illumined, i.e. not even a small
part of it depends for its illumination on something else. The fact,
vouched for in this text, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in its entirety being a mere mass

texts, of its possessing qualities such as freedom from <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> and so on,
which inhere in it as the subject of those qualities; not any more than
the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of the lump of salt being taste through and through--which <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span>
is known through the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of taste--conflicts with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> of its
possessing such other qualities as colour, hardness, and so on, which
are known through the eye and the other sense-organs. The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the
entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is as follows--just as the lump of salt has throughout one
and the same taste, while other sapid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as mangoes and other
fruit have different tastes in their different parts, rind and so on; so
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is throughout of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or self-illuminedness.--
Here terminates the adhikarana of 'that which is like Brahman.'




8. By the mere will; Scripture stating that.

Concerning the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> Scripture states, 'He moves about there,
laughing, playing, rejoicing, be it with women, or chariots, or
relatives' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 3). The doubt here arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the
soul's meeting with relatives and the rest presupposes an effort on its
part or follows on its mere will--as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> spring from the mere will of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person.--An effort is required; for we observe in ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that even such persons as kings and the like who are capable of
realising all their wishes do not accomplish the effects desired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
some effort.--Against this <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> the Sûtra says 'by the mere will.' For,
in a previous passage, Scripture expressly says, 'He who desires the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the Fathers, by his mere will the Fathers rise to receive him,'
&c. (VIII, 2, 1). And there is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declaring the need of effort
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> oblige us to define and limit the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> last
quoted.




9. And for this very <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> another ruler.

Since the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> realises all its wishes, it does not stand under
another ruler. For to be under a ruler means to be subject to injunction
and prohibition, and to be such is opposed to being <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> in the
realisation of all one's wishes. Hence Scripture says, 'he is a Self-

10. The absence, Bâdari holds; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Scripture says.

A doubt arises <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the Released has a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and sense-organs, or not;
or <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> he has them or not just as he pleases. The teacher Bâdari
holds that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and sense-organs are absent; since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares
this. The text--'as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he is embodied there is no freedom from
pleasure and pain; but when he is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> then neither
pleasure nor pain touches him' (Ch. Up. VIII, 12, 1)--declares that
pleasure and pain are necessarily connected with embodiedness; and the
text--'having risen from this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and reached the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> he
manifests himself in his own shape' (VIII, 12, 3)--declares that the
Released one is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a body.




11. The presence, Jaimini holds; because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares manifoldness.

The teacher Jaimini holds that the Released one has a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and senses;
because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> declares manifoldness--'He is onefold, he is threefold,
he is fivefold, he is sevenfold' (Ch. Up. VII, 26, 2). The Self which is
one and indivisible cannot be manifold, and the various forms of
manifoldness of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> speaks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> must depend on the body.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which speaks of the absence of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> refers to the absence of
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only which is due to Karman; for this latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> only is the
cause of pleasure and pain. Next the Reverend Bâdarâyana decides this
point by the declaration of his own view.




12. For this <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> Bâdarâyana (holds him to be) of both kinds; as in
the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the twelve days' sacrifice.

'For this reason,' i.e. for the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> refers to the wish
of the Released, the Reverend Bâdarâyana is of opinion that the Released
may, at his liking, be with or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a body. This satisfies both kinds
of texts. The <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> is analogous to that of the twelve days' <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
which, on the basis of twofold texts--'Those desirous of prosperity are
to celebrate the dvâdasâha,' and 'The priest is to offer the dvâdasâha
for him who desires offspring'--belongs, according to difference of wish,
either to the sattra or the ahîna class of sacrifices.--The next Sûtra
declares that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the sense-organs of the Released are not
necessarily <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the Released himself.




13. In the absence of a body, as in the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of dream; that being
possible.

As in the absence of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and other instruments of enjoyment <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>
by himself, the Released may undergo experiences of pleasure by means of
instruments <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Person, the Released, although
capable of realising all his wishes, may not himself be creative. As in
the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of dream the individual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has experiences depending on
chariots and other implements <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> ('He creates chariots,
horses,' &c., Bri. Up. IV, 3, 10); <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> also may have
experience of different worlds <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> engaged in playful
sport.




14. When there is a body, as in the waking state.

When, on the other hand, the released <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> possesses a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by
its own will, then it enjoys its various delights in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as a
waking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does.--In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">Person</span> creates out of
himself, for his own delight, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the Fathers and so on; so he
sometimes creates such worlds for the enjoyment of the released souls.
But sometimes, again, the souls using their own creative will-power
themselves create their own worlds, which however are included <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span>

them do not <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> beyond the intuition of Brahman).

But it has been taught that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is of atomic size; how then can it
connect itself with many bodies?--To this question the next Sûtra
replies.




15. The entering is as in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a lamp; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Scripture

Just as a lamp, although abiding in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> only, enters through the

also, although limited to one place, may through its light-like

to make many bodies its own. For Scripture declares, 'That living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

How then can it be said to know all things?--To this the next Sûtra
replies.

22. Non-return, according to Scripture; non-return, according to

absolute bliss and goodness; who is fundamentally antagonistic to all

when pleased by the faithful worship of his Devotees--which worship
consists in daily repeated <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> on Him, assisted by the
performance of all the practices prescribed for each caste and âsrama--
frees them from the influence of Nescience which consists of karman
accumulated in the infinite progress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and hence hard to overcome;

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span>

We are already on our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of computer users.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span>
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,

Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> is not listed and
you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in states where we are

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> may be sent to:

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!
