The Concept of Jivanmukti in Advaita And Other Topics

ShrIgurubhyo namaH
HariH Om
Recently I saw the following observation in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) of
the site: www.dvaita.org.

Why does Tattvavâda deny jîvan-mukti?
//Because a mukta, or liberated person, should not even be physically present in the
material universe, unlike the un-liberated. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who is living in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot be
said to be <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> of sorrow <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of material contact, and also cannot be said to experience
the joy of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> at all times. The very act of living in a gross material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
entails <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as eating, sleeping, pleasure and pain, etc., which cannot be accepted
in a mukta.
//The Advaitic concept of a jîvanmukta is also absurd because a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who has
surmounted the realm of perception and realized the Absolute (as Advaita holds of a
mukta) should not continue to exist <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and interact with the realm of perception that
he has realized as being not-Real—no one continues to perceive a snake after realizing
that the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of his perception is actually a rope. The suggestion that such bondage to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of perception continues for a while after the occurrence of Realization, because
of past attachments, is not tenable—such attachments themselves are artifacts of the
perceived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that has supposedly been sublated, and should not continue to besiege
the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Realized. If they do, then we have to either reject the Realization
that is said to have occurred, or else reject the notion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of perception, as
manifesting through the attachments on a supposedly Realized person, can be sublated.
In either instance, the notion of jîvanmukti is not meaningful. //
After reading the above, the following was <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of mananam. The purpose
is to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> out how an advaitin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> look at such an objection/opinion. In the process of
this exercise, some more topics were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up that are either directly or indirectly
connected with the main topic. As a result the document grew to its present size of 50
pages.It is possible that there are some repetitions of ideas/quotes.
Originally, there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of presenting this document to the organizers of the
Dwaita.org site. It was meant to be a study material for interested mumukshus. Owning
to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that objections against Advaita arise due to inadequate grasping of the system
as it is taught and practiced in the sampradaya, I <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> a decision to send the document to
the website so that the Advaitin’s perspective of various topics could be made known.
No criticism or counter-objections are intended in this attempt at dissemination of
knowledge. If this spirit, the one that could be seen in the recent Kannada <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> ‘Mata

2
traya sameekshaa’ by Dr. A.V. Nagasampige, is had in mind, this document <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
served its purpose. The emphasis is mainly on explaining the stand of the Advaitin while
viewing the objections. It is possible that quotes in Sanskrit (Devanagari) lipi does not
come out in transmission. The references given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> help in that case. Om Tat Sat.

The Explanation commences here:
In the Bhagavadgita, a ‘Tattavit’ is distinguished from the ignorant <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> as:
prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
ahaṃkāravimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate 3.27
tattvavit tu mahābāho guṇakarmavibhāgayoḥ
guṇā guṇeṣu vartanta iti matvā na sajjate 3.28
Again, in the fifth chapter, we have the lakshana of a tattvavit described:
naiva kiṃcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattvavit
paśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighrann aśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan 5.8
pralapan visṛjan gṛhṇann unmiṣan nimiṣann api
indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartanta iti dhārayan 5.9
The bodily acts of eating, sleeping, etc. are possible in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a Tattvavit while
living, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the ‘aham karta’ bhava which is what is destroyed in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the
tattvavit at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of realization, aparoksha jnanam, of the Atman/Brahman.
That such a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> is admitted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is evident from His words:
sarvakarmāṇi manasā saṃnyasyāste sukhaṃ vaśī
navadvāre pure dehī naiva kurvan na kārayan 5.13
yatendriyamanobuddhirmunir mokṣaparāyaṇaḥ
vigatecchābhayakrodho yaḥ sadā mukta eva saḥ 5.28
The mention of the ‘nine-gated city’ to mean that the Knower of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> still lives is
significant. And that such a knower, ‘does not do nor cause anything to be done’ is also
clear evidence for the released <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> while living which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> jivanmukti. All the
bodily functions can go on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hindering the vision of the Absolute that the liberated
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> has gained by dint of his sadhana. His is the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of ‘naishkarmyam’, the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of
Brahman. The other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> quoted above has Bhagavan’s own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> that such a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is
ever-liberated.

The lessons on samatvam, equanimity, in dvandvas like joy, sorrow, laabha, alaabha, etc.,
which are to be practiced by a sadhaka, when practiced adequately, remain in the tattvavit
even after gaining the aparoksha saakshatkara. So, when the body/mind complex is
subject to these dvandvas, owing to prarabdha karma, he remains unaffected as they
pertain to the deha/manas which are evolutes of prakriti, which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has taught as
anatma and the jnani has realized it to be so. If this were not to be so, the following
lakshanas of a ‘gunaatita’ will be questionable:
udāsīnavad āsīno guṇair yo na vicālyate
guṇā vartanta ity eva yovatiṣṭhati neṅgate 14.23
samaduḥkhasukhaḥ svasthaḥ samaloṣṭāśmakāñcanaḥ
tulyapriyāpriyo dhīras tulyanindātmasaṃstutiḥ 14.24
mānāpamānayos tulyas tulyo mitrāripakṣayoḥ
sarvārambhaparityāgī guṇātītaḥ sa ucyate 14.25
And also,
na prahṛṣyet priyaṃ prāpya nodvijet prāpya cāpriyam
sthirabuddhir asaṃmūḍho brahmavid brahmaṇi sthitaḥ 5.20
bāhyasparśeṣv asaktātmā vindaty ātmani yat sukham
sa brahmayogayuktātmā sukham akṣayam aśnute 5.21
ye hi saṃsparśajā bhogā duḥkhayonaya eva te
ādyantavantaḥ kaunteya na teṣu ramate budhaḥ 5.22
śaknotīhaiva yaḥ soḍhuṃ prāk śarīravimokṣaṇāt

yontaḥsukhontarārāmas tathāntarjyotir eva yaḥ
sa yogī brahmanirvāṇaṃ brahmabhūtodhigacchati 5.24
When is the ‘samachittatva’ practiced by the sadhaka put to test? Not when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is
not available. It is impossible to have dvandva anubhava in the absence of the body/mind
complex. The teaching of samachittatva becomes meaningful only in the possibility of
their (of dvandvas’) occurrence and the Jnani’s ability to remain equanimous. Being
affected by dvandvas is what samsara is and moksha is release from such identification
with dvandvas. This mochanam is what is demonstrated by the above verses. That is
why it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> jivanmukti.
The following verses of the VI <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> too throw much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the topic. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
‘brahmabhūtah’ is especially significant in that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says that such a yogi who is a
Tattvavit is ‘Brahman’ Itself. This is reminiscent of the Upanishadic statement: ‘brahma

4
veda brahmaiva bhavati‘. This is undoubtedly jivanmukti. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> ‘sarvathā
vartamānopi sa yogī mayi vartate 6.31’ bear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> significance to the ‘actions’ of a Jnani.
In <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> he is a grihastha, he will have to do the duties. In <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> he is a sannyasi, there will
be no worldly duties. <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">Whether</span> required to do duties or not, sarvathaa vartamaanopi, the
Jnani does not lose sight of the Absolute. Again the message of Jivanmukti is
unmistakable. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says that such a mukta ever abides in Me, Brahman. When such
a Jnani is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> Itself, where is the doubt that he is a mukta right now?
praśāntamanasaṃ hy enaṃ yoginaṃ sukham uttamam
upaiti śāntarajasaṃ brahmabhūtam akalmaṣam 6.27
sarvabhūtastham ātmānaṃ sarvabhūtāni cātmani

ātmaupamyena sarvatra samaṃ paśyati yorjuna
sukhaṃ vā yadi vā duḥkhaṃ sa yogī paramo mataḥ 6.32
It is agreed that becoming affected by dvandvas is what constitutes samsara. So, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
prescribes the sadhana of practicing equanimity in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of dvandvas. That means, as
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lives, dvandvas cannot be avoided or wished away. They keep coming
in turns. But the tattvavit who has become <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from ignorance, ajnana, has gained the
ability to stand equanimous, unaffected, in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of dvandvas. Since the gunatita,
sthitaprajna lakshanas are prescribed, it obviously means that such a gunatita, tattvavit, is
still alive. For, there is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in prescribing these lakshanas if there was no
possibility of a Jnani who has freed himself from samsara continuing to live in the body.
Since Jnana is the means to moksha and since moksha means release from samsara
caused by ajnana, jnanaprapti, and not death, means samsaarAt mochanam. That such a
mukta can be admitted to live till the fall of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is what is amply evidenced by the
verses on the gunatita/sthitaprajna. Dvandva-s, the other name for samsara, are unable to
affect this Jnani:
yadṛcchālābhasaṃtuṣṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ
samaḥ siddhāv asiddhau ca kṛtvāpi na nibadhyate 4.22
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Jivanmukti: Remaining unaffected by the dvandva-s. This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
of moksha from samsara.
Thus, there is nothing unusual in the mukta purusha eating, sleeping, facing pleasure and
pain, etc. while being still embodied in the nava-dvara pura deha.

differentiates a samsari from a mukta is the presence of the aham-karta/bhokta bhava and

6
its absence. To be akarta (eating, sleeping) and abhokta (sukha,dukha) one need not die.
Tattvavedanam destroys the kartritva/bhoktritva bhava. It does not destroy the prAna.
Nor does Tattvavedanam require prAna-tyaga to give its fruit of liberation. ‘Tam evam
vidvAn amrita iha bhavati’ says the Purusha Suktam. There is absolutely no difficulty
in explaining statements like:’ pretya asmAn lokAt amrutaa bhavanti’. ‘Loka’ is this
samsaric world. To ‘leave’ it is to render it powerless to affect the mukta purusha. To
disidentify oneself from the body/mind is what is moksha. This is enabled by aparoksha
jnanam. So, a jnani-mukta becomes amruta the moment the jnana dawns. One need not
die to become amruta.
//The Advaitic concept of a jîvanmukta is also absurd because a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who has
surmounted the realm of perception and realized the Absolute (as Advaita holds of a
mukta) should not continue to exist <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and interact with the realm of perception that

of past attachments, is not tenable—such attachments themselves are artifacts of the

the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Realized. If they do, then we have to either reject the Realization
that is said to have occurred, or else reject the notion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of perception, as
manifesting through the attachments on a supposedly Realized person, can be sublated.
In either instance, the notion of jîvanmukti is not meaningful. //
Reply:
The realm of perception is the realm of Maya. That this Maya is ‘GunamayI’ is said by
the Lord. To ‘cross over Maya’ is to realize, first hand, that it is unreal. The practice for
that is to follow the ways of the Gunatita who considers, nay experiences, that the
function of perception, etc. are a play of Maya (gunA guneshu vartante/ indriyANi
indriyArtheshu vartante). The fruit of the practice is the aparoksha anubhava of the
Absolute in which realm there is no Maya. If total freedom from prakriti (identification

There is an instance of Rama’s ‘sleeping’ recorded in the Ramayana:
/One day, when Rama and Sita were dwelling on the North-eastern base of the Chitrakuta
mountain, not far from the Ganges, a crow perched near Sita. She sought to drive the
bird away by hurling a clod of mud at it but it defiantly remained in Her vicinity.
Sometime later, as Rama slept on Her lap, the wicked bird sharply attacked Her breast.
Again and again it tore at her bosom and her blood wet Rama. She woke up Rama and

There are instances of Rama ‘eating’ in the Ramayana. For example, Rama had vowed
not to <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> cooked <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> and sustain on fruits and roots gathered at the forest during His
vanavasa. Rama did not accept hospitality in Sugreeva’s palace. Rama did accept these
in the hermitages of Sages Sharabhanga, Agasthya, etc. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> hearing of the passing

There is the instance of His eating the berries offered by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> devotee Shabari.
A question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> arise: Rama and Krishna are Bhagavan, Ishwara, themselves in those
bodies. How can they be placed on par with the other jivas (muktas)? The former are
nityamuktas while the latter were baddha jivas and have attained the status later.
The above question is answered thus:
Although it might appear that there is a distinction, on closer analysis of the Gita and
other scriptures, it can be seen that Bhagavan Himself does not want to maintain such a
distinction. For example, in the Fourth <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says:

way: The knower, jiva, too realizes, on the basis of the teaching of the scriptures and the
Lord, that the birth and actions of himself too, are mayic alone and not real.
For example, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says in this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> itself:

truth, He is akarta, non-doer. He is Eternal, Nirvikari (avyayam). And such a non-doer’s

How is it possible that the knower of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> about Bhagavan’s actions becomes freed
from actions? This is possible under only one condition: Such a knower-jiva realizes that
even he is akarta in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and even his actions are in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> not binding him.

sanAtana, sarvagataH, achala, etc., all of which are applicable to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as well.
The essence of the above verses is: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that the jiva is non-different from
Brahman. There is nothing that can differentiate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> from jiva excepting the
upadhis. When the upadhis are known to be false, mayic, the One Pure <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span>
that is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and that is what the jiva is, alone remains as the Advaitam. (Shantam,
Shivam Advaitam of the Mandukya 7th mantra) and that is what the jiva is savrUpataH.
Thus, the ‘eating, sleeping, facing pleasure and pain’ cannot affect the nitya-mukta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the jiva who has realized the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> and continues in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> for a while. These are
quite compatible with the mukta as they belong only to the asatya deha-mana-upadhis.
He has, by dint of the sakshatkara, freed himself from identifying with these upadhis.
There are a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Upanishadic passages that teach the non-difference of the Supreme
and the individual:
‘AtmA hyeShAm sa bhavati’(Br.Up.I.4.10) says that the Brahmavit who attains the
‘sarvabhAva’ (I am the All), is the AtmA, Self, of the devas.’ The context is <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the
deva-s can create obstacles in the Jnani getting the phalam of jnanam namely moksha.
The Upanishat negates this possibility by asserting that since the Jnani, verily Brahman,
the sarvAtmA, is (also) the Self of the Deva-s, there cannot be any obstacle from the
devas in the Jnani’s liberation.

10

‘atha yo’nyAm devatAm upAste’nyo’sau aham anyo’smi iti na sa veda’ (Br.Up.I.4.10)
says: ‘He who worships another god, thinking, ‘He is one and I am another’ does not
know.’
‘udaram antaram kurute, atha tasya bhayam bhavati’ (Taittiriya Up. 2,7.1) says: ‘He who
conceives in terms of the slightest difference between himself and the Supreme, for him
there is fear.’
Whenever such a non-difference between the Supreme and the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> is taught, it
must be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that the identity is not with respect to the upadhis of the Supreme
and the individual. The Lord, in the Gita has given enough instances to show His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Nor does He <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> the jivas in
contact with their karma phalam. All these happen by the play of maya, avidya.

not involve Himself in any of these functions related to the jiva-s. In the 14th ch. 19th
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> He says that ‘Whoever realizes that there is no doer other than the guna-s and
knows the Self that is beyond the guna-s attains to My nature. This means that the
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> Self that is untouched by the guna-s is non-different from the Supreme Self
that is also untouched by the prakriti. It is in this <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> that the identity is understood.
With prakriti as upadhi, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is sarvashakta and the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> is limited by nature.
Since this is the vyavaharic situation, the scriptures, alluding to this, teach the
paramarthic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that is bereft of the upadhis.

verse.]

[The <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> that is non-doer, different-from-prakriti, is none other than Brahman,
the ‘Cause’ of the entire universe. This is the Atman, that is spoken of in the earlier
verse. The Chandogya Upanishad (VII.26.1) says: ‘AtmataH prANaH….’ meaning, from
Atman has emerged the entire universe. The Taittriya Up. says: ‘AtmanaH aakAshaH
sambhUtaH,…’. This Upanishat teaches: Brahmavit Apnoti param. Satyam Jnanam
Anantam Brahma. Where is this Atman/Brahman to be found and realized? ‘yo veda
nihitam guhAyAm parame vyoman’, It is available in the cave of the intellect. It is this
Consciousness, Atman, that is taught as the one beyond the five sheaths, koshas. It is this
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> that every <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> experiences as himself, although not knowing with

of the intellect is the knower of Brahman, Brahma-vit. Atmavit = Brahmavit. This
proves beyond doubt that there are no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> consciousness-es, Atman and Brahman. This
is the One and Only <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> that is spoken of ‘…jnAnam, jneyam, jnAnagamyam, hRdi sarvasya vishthitam’ and ‘dhyAnena Atmani pashyanti kechit AtmAnam

In the Brihadaranyaka Up. there is the famous ‘Maitreyi Brahmanam’ where occurs the
teaching ‘Atmanastu kAmAya sarvam priyam bhavati’. Sage Yajnavalkya considers all
the possible objects that one desires and holds dear and finally concludes that all these
objects are dear only because they are subordinate to one’s own Self, Atman. This is
readily appreciable as it is so in our experience. Then the Sage goes on to say that this
Atman which is the dearest of all and is non-negotiable is the one to be known clearly,
i.e, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the admixture of the non-Atman, so as to result in attaining the summum
bonum of life. This Atma-jnanam is the mukti hetu. What is noteworthy here is that
there is no differentiation of Atman, the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> Self, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the
Parameshwara. In the Kathopanishat, the very question of Nachiketas is about the
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> Self. While giving a detailed reply to this question, Yamadharmaraja explains
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of Atman as non-different from Brahman. We are NOT <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> wodering <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span>
it is Atma jnanam or Brahma jnanam that is moksha kAranam. All these point to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
that there are no ‘two’ Atmans, jiva and Parama. It is One <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> only that is
spoken of in all the Upanishads as the Aupanishada Purusha. Atma sAkshAtkara is the
same as Brahma sAkshAtkara. The Kathopanishat mantra (II.i.1) ‘parAnchi khAni…..’
says: pratyagAtmaanam aikshat…amrutatvam icchan, meaning, pratyagAtma jnanam is
the liberating knowledge. This pratyagAtman is what is specified as the one transcending
the body-mind-ego complex as ‘tad vishnoH paramam padam’. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is settled beyond
doubt that the Atma of the jiva is none other than Brahman.
Who are we in truth?
To this question, generally we reply that we are the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> associated with a body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>

as it is <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> out of avidya/adhyasa, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> takes up the task of giving the teaching, in a

The ‘idam’, kshetram, the inert principle that is experienced as an object, vishaya, is to be
seen as different from the ‘aham’, the vishayi, the Consciousness, the kshetrajna. But, by
this much we are not given the entire picture. We have been taught what we are not.
What we are in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to be specified.

The kshetrajna that is experienced in all of us as ‘I’ the Consciousness, is He Himself,
says the Lord. In effect, the teaching is: the ‘aham’ determined in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is
‘Brahman’ as taught in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> verse. Thus, in truth, we are Brahman.
We can arrive at the incontrovertible scriptural evidence for the jiva-Brahma abheda by a
short analysis:
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says in the Gita:

kṣetrajñaṃ cāpi māṃ viddhi sarvakṣetreṣu bhārata
kṣetrakṣetrajñayor jñānaṃ yat taj jñānaṃ mataṃ mama 13.2
The point made in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is: the mind-body, kshetram, is the vedya, ‘known’,
vishaya. The kshetrajna is the vEttA, the knower, vishayI principle. The kshetrajna is
the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> available in the jiva chaitanyam and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> AtmA. This none can
deny as everyone experiences his body/mind as an object.

that says that this is the Atman that is realized by the aspirant:
dhyānenātmani paśyanti kecid ātmānam ātmanā
anye sāṃkhyena yogena karmayogena cāpare 13.24
The point that is being made now is: Atman is the knower of the body-mind anAtman
kshetram.
We have in the Kenopanishat the following mantra:

Brahman. By juxtaposing the Gita verses above with this Kenopanishat mantra we
conclude that Atman, the knower of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Brahman, the knower of
the mind. The result of this short analysis is: (jiva)Atman is (Para)Brahman. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

The Mandukya
Upanishad too says: ‘ayam Atmaa Brahma’ by pointing to ‘this’ proximately known
Atman-Consciousness as Brahman. In the seventh mantra, after negating the jagat that is
the kArya, the Upanishat says: shAntam shivam advaitam (the jagat-kAranam divested of
the kAranatva status) is Atma. The adjective ‘shAntam’ of the TurIya in this Upanishat
could be seen as the ‘tadyaccet shAnta Atmani’ of the Kathopanishat where the Atman is
the pratyagAtman alone, undoubtedly. This Atman is the innermost, guhA-hitam, beyond
the mind, intellect, ego. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the TurIya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is Shantam and the pratyagAtman

his self/Brahman attains pUrnatva and is liberated. This ‘residing in the cave of the
intellect’ is what is meant by the ‘pravesha’ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> into the bodies which is termed
kshetram/anAtmA/prakriti, etc. The 13th ch. teaches that the Purusha/Brahman resides in
the prakriti/body and experiences, out of ignorance, the guna-s <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of prakriti. The
separating, through viveka, from prakriti is what constitutes liberation.
The above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> also proves the scriptural teaching of jiva-Ishwara abheda.
The above analysis, incidentally, provides the answer to a possible objection, arising out
of not grasping the Advaitic/Upanishadic teaching correctly: How can there be pUrNatva
to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> which is said to be conditioned by MAyA (MAyAvacchinnasya
BrahmanaH katham pUrNatvam upapadyate)? The reply is: The conditioning in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of residing in the body/mind complex is not Absolute but is only incidental, Avidyaka.
When by taking recourse to sadhana based on the Guru-Shastra upadesha one realizes
that the sAkshi chaitanyam obtaining in the guhA = intellect is the akhanda Brahma
chaitanyam, the avidya conditioning is destroyed and the native pUrnatvam is realized as
‘I have ever been PUrNa’.
Is the realization in the manner ‘aham Brahma asmi’ an expression of arrogance?
There is an impression among the theistic schools, who are unable to arrive at the prime
purport of the Vedanta, that the Advaitin’s interpretation of Upanishadic teachings ‘Tat
tvam asi’, ‘Aham Brahma asmi’, etc. amount to an expression of arrogance on the part of
one who teaches so and the one who realizes so. That such a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> is founded on
ignorance is not difficult to understand. The Mandukya Upanishad teaches: ‘shAntam
shivam advaitam, sa Atma, sa vijneyaH’ [the TurIya is Peace Supreme, Auspiciousness
and Non-dual. It is the Self and has to be realized (for liberation)] The Kathopanishad
teaches: ‘tad vishnoH paramam padam’ when specifying the transcendental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the
Absolute Truth. The Chandogya Upanishad teaches: ‘tat satyam, sa Atma, tat tvam asi’
[That is the ever-existent Truth, It is the Self, That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> art]. The Brihadaranyaka
Up.teaches: ‘tat AtmAnam eva avet aham brahma asmi iti’ [It realized Itself as ‘I am
Brahman’]. This very Upanishad (IV.iv.13) teaches the mode of realization of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span>
thus:

The teaching here is: whoever realizes the Atma, self, as ‘this Atma, am I’ no longer
remains in embodied nature.
We find, in the above instance, such an ‘anvaya’ (positive) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of teaching by the Shruti
as to ‘how’ the realization aught to be. We also <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the ‘vyatireka’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of teaching by
the Shruti as to ‘how not’ the realization aught to be. For example: the Brihadaranyaka
Up. I.iv.10 teaches: ‘atha yo anyAm devatAm upAste “anyo asau anyo aham asmi” iti
na sa veda yathaa pashurevam sa devaanAm’. Whoever worships/contemplates any deity
with the attitude: ‘This deity is different and I am different’ does so in ignorance; he is
indicted as a slavish animal to the deity’. The purport of the ‘anvaya’ and ‘vyatireka’
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of teaching is that: Atman/Brahman is to be realized as oneself only and not
otherwise.
Apart from this, those who advance the ‘arrogance’ <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> fail to see that when the Shastra
teaches abheda saakshAtkAra, it is not doing it in the level of the body-mind
identification. It teaches first the method of dissociating the Consciousness, the Self,
from the superimposed not-self consisting of the body-mind (through the pancha-kosha
viveka, avasthAtraya viveka, etc). Doing this at the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> level is not enough. The
separating of the upadhis from the Cosmic Self, Brahman, is also required. This is done
by negating the creatorhood, managerhood, etc. of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> and seeing just the Pure
Consciousness. The Mandukya Upanishad does this admirably. After teaching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> self and Cosmic Self with the upadhis in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pAda-s, vishva-virAt,
taijasa-hiranyagarbha and prAjna-Ishwara, the Upanishad embarks on the exercise of
negating all the upadhis (of both the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> and the Supreme Self) in the seventh
mantra: ‘na antaH prajnam…., etc’. What remains as unnegatable finally is: ShAntm
Shivam Advaitam. This Truth, the Upanishad says: ‘sa AtmA, sa vijneyaH’ is the Self
that has to be realized.
In the Bhagavad Gita too we can discern this method. For example, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> of the
13th chapter: ‘kshetrajnam cha api mAm viddhi’ the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is not equating the body-mindupadhi-jiva with Himself. He separates the kshetrajna, the Consciousness, Knower, from
the kshtra, the inert principle, the known. It is only after separating the body-mind
complex from the chaitanyam does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teach the aikyam. On the part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
too, we can determine from the various other verses that He is the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> that is
‘akartA’, ‘avyaya’, ‘na cha matsthAni bhUtaani’ etc.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the abheda, aikyam, taught by the Shastra is only in the level of Pure
Consciousness, the nirupAdhika chaitanya. In the sopaadhika chaitanya no aikyam is
possible. The accusation of ‘arrogance’ might be valid only when someone claims he is
Brahman/Ishwara <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving up the body-identification.

the part of the teacher and the sadhaka is to impute the Upanishad itself of perpeterating
arrogance.

<span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Reason</span> too supports that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> liberation ensues from the realization of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> as ‘I am

from the cycle of births and deaths. It is only he who gains the conviction, through direct

death. To this end, it is not sufficient if one realizes that ‘Bhagavan/Atman/Brahman is
amRta svarUpa’ and conclude ‘I am different from Bhagavan/Brahman/Atman’. The
notion <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of ignorance: ‘I am a samsari, subject to birth and death’ can go only when it
is replaced by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> arising out of the appropriate Pramana: ‘I am not a samsari,
I am amRta, amaraNadharmA’. My realizing that some one other than me is amRta will
not confer on me the liberation from death/samsara. There are a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Upanishadic
passages that declare the realization of an aspirant:
It is reported in the Taittiriya Upanishad, sIkshAvallI (I.x.1): ‘aham vRkshasya rerivaa,
kIrthiH pRShTham gireriva..sumedhA amRtokshitaH’ [ ‘I am the invigorator of the tree

was the statement after the realization of the unity of the Self expressed by Sage
Trishanku] . ). In the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of Sage Trishanku’s declaration the Taittiriya Up. itself says:
‘iti Trishankor-veda-anu-vachanam’ meaning: This declaration of Trishanku is in
accordance with the Veda.
‘ahamannam ahamannam….’ is the declaration of the realization of the sarvAtma bhAva
by Bhrigu in the Taittiriya Upanishad (III.x.5-6).
We have in the Aitareya Upanishad the declaration of sage Vaamadeva which is
unmistakably his realization of SarvAtmabhAva and release from bondage that existed
previously.
The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I.iv.9) raises a question:

Replying this question, the Upanishad itself says in the very next mantra: (I.iv.10):

Understanding ‘ahankaara’ (a possible synonym for ‘arrogance’):
Much of the confusion arises because of not analyzing the ‘I’, ‘aham’ concept. The
scriptures and the ShaastrakAra-s have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> pains to do this exercise with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to

The certitude of the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> ‘I am a mere collection of hands, feet and other organs’ is the

(Note: While the first type is typical of the Advaitic sadhana, the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> type could be
viewed as typefying the Bhakti sadhana of the Dwaita/Vishishtadwaita schools.)

The Panchadashi of Swami Vidyaranya too enumerates the types of I-sense. Says the

[Question: In the Pure <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> that is unattached with anything else, how can there
exist the I-sense?

secondary. The primary one is the result of the mutual superimposition of the
Unchanging Self and the reflected <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> (body-mind complex). This admixture
is the one identified with by the ignorant people. (Being resorted to by most people, it is

20
The Jnani, Knower, however, separates the Unchanging Self from the reflected
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> and identifies with both of the I-senses, in a ‘toggling’ manner, while
engaging in worldly and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> parlances.

In worldly vyavahara such as ‘I an going to…’, the Knower separates the reflected
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> (from the Pure Consciousness) and uses the ‘I’ in this sense.
When engaging in contemplating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Pure <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> as ‘I am the unattached

by giving no room for any ‘arrogance’ in the process.
Are we many?

Having seen that the jiva-Ishwara bheda is founded on false knowledge, let us examine
the jiva-jiva bheda. We have the experience, ‘I am different from the others’. Each of us
swears that he is undoubtedly a conscious being. Is this not proof of our being different
individuals? To such a question, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> replies:
In the 13th <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> there is a verse:
avibhaktaṃ ca bhūteṣu vibhaktam iva ca sthitam 13.16
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says that Brahman, Consciousness, is not divisible; It cannot be fragmented and
distributed in each individual. But it appears to be divided in various individuals. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> uses the particle ‘iva’ to denote the seeming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of such a division. The Shruti
‘Nishkalam…’ denies parts or amsha-s in Brahman/Atman. Admitting amsha-s in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is against other shruti teachings like ‘vijnaana ghanaH’, ‘ekam eva advitIyam’,
‘ajam, avyayam’,etc. Smriti, the Gita, too is against this contention. The Sutra ‘avibhAgo
vachanAt’ IV.ii.16 also denies any vibhaaga, kalaa, amsha, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the absolute
state. The Prashna Up. VI.5 states: ’ bhidyete tAsAm nAmarUpe.sa esho a-kalo amruto

21
bhavati’. That which is made up of parts is essentially a created one and not ajam. When
the parts, amshas, disintegrate, the ‘whole’, amshI, faces destruction. Then, what is the
basis of our ‘holding’ that we are all different individuals? The reply is: We see the
different bodies and get deluded that we are different individuals. Deha-nAnaatva is
mistaken for chaitanya nAnAtva. Since each of us has, due to adhyasa, conceived a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
which is finite, paricchinna and apUrna, we conclude that each is a finite, different
individual. The kshetram does not subsist in the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of Moksha; it is separated from the
Purusha and discarded. So, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be wrong to hold that the Mukta will continue to
have a distinct entity of his own from the others, either while alive or after the fall of the
body. All distinguishing factors belong to the kshetram/prakriti alone and the
Purusha/Brahman is untouched by this.
Then what about the Lord’s other statements where there is a clear indication of many
jivas?

The above is corroborated through the Lord’s own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> in the 13th chapter:

‘kshetram’ cannot mean ‘the entire world/creation’ ; it can mean ‘the body’ alone. This
is because, apart from other reasons, the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the plural ‘sarva-kshetreshu’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have

The wording of this verse:

that gives the impression mentioned above. That this has to be so is clearly understood

In the 18th Chapter, for instance, while specifying what constitutes saattvic jnAnam He
says:
sarvabhUteShu yena ekam bhAvam avyayam IkShate
avibhaktam vibhakteShu taj jnAnam viddhi sAttvikam 18.20
The One undiminishing, ever-existing, undifferentiated essence that runs through all the

scriptures point out that this is none other than Brahman. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> points out what does

Holding that the varied <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are truly different from each other and are distinct entities
is tainted knowledge. Quite contrary to the unenquired notion held by thosee uninitiated
into Shastra that the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are really different, tattvato bhinnAH, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that

Where else do we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> this teaching in the Gita?
In the 5th Ch. verse,

apparent duality/variety. The Non-dual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> is Samam, of equal nature, in all apparently
different beings. While the Samam is the unchanging essence, the ‘containers’ of this
Samam are ephemeral. They are insubstantial, being products of prakriti. It is the
separating of the Purusha from Prakriti (as taught in the 13th ch.) that constitutes
liberating knowledge. Such a Jnani transcends samsara ‘here itself’ as the above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span>

Again, in this following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> too the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that the difference among <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is
only seeming and not real:

The One Indwelling <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> remains undivided really but is mistaken to be
differentiated. The variety in the bodies is mistaken to be the variety in the One
Consciousness, Brahman. The word/particle ‘iva’ above shows this.

transmigration to other lokas, rebirth, karma, etc. the difference among jivas is
acknowledged by the Shruti. But this is only in the relative plane. When it comes to

The Turiya is taught as ‘shAntam shivam advaitam’. The transcendtal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> does not
transmigrate and has no karma. What transmigrates is only the antaHkarana along with its
samskaras. This is only aupAdhika. The Atman <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> of these upAdhis is the Atman to be
realized for liberation.

That vision is conducive to liberation which consists of recognizing a Unitary Principle
that runs through the entire creation. A vision that admits absolute differences is
censured by the Gita as rajasic and tamasic.

What about the difference between chetana (sentient) and inert objects?
The general thinking is: We, the perceivers, are chetana, sentient beings, and the
perceived objects are inert, jaDa. In the 13th ch. beginning itself, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> makes this
distinction: the kshetram, body-mind, jaDa, is the vedya, perceived. The Kshetrajna, the
knower is chaitanya, Consciousness. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be helpful to know that the kshetram is
otherwise known as prakriti. The similarity between the constituents of the kshetram
spoken of in the 13th ch. and the constituents of prakriti in the 7th ch. is striking. From
the overall teaching of the scriptures, the Gita in particular, we understand that the
prakriti/kshetram is conducive to bondage and liberation consists of separating the
Purusha/Kshetrajna from it. Since liberating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> consists of excluding the prakriti
from Purusha, it follows that prakriti is not of the status of the absolutely real; it enjoys
only a relative reality. That which is not absolutely real and is only relatively real is
otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> mithya. Now, since we are concerned with the ‘difference between
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> and the kshetram, the jaDa,’ we have to recognize that any difference
(bheda)/relationship (sambandha) between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> entities is possible only when they enjoy
the same status of reality. We cannot compare a table in the waking with a table in the
dream. Since the kshetram, jaDa, is accorded the status of ‘mithya’, to say that it is
different from chetana is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> and substance. There are no ‘two’ entities
to compare and contrast; there is only one chetana and the other cannot be counted along
with the chetana as a second. So, the question of establishing a ‘bheda’ between chetana
and jaDa does not arise at all.
The Chandogya Upanishat Ch.VI teaches:
//vAchArambhanam vikAro nAmadheyam, mRttiketyeva satyam.//
Brahman, Sat, is the material cause that inheres in every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception. As
every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> is essentially ‘Sat’, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> is ‘Sat’, Brahman. As the
Upanishad teaches the effect is no more than a name, the ‘vastu’ that is seen as an effect
is none other than Sat, Brahman. The ultimate teaching is: Since all objects are
appearances in Brahman, their material cause, they are non-different, abheda, from their
substratum. As such, there is no question of bheda between the Chaityanyam, Brahman,
and the achetana, jada objects.
That the Upanishad teaches that ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the upadana karanam is the one that
makes all the effects, sarvam kAryam, known’ is undisputable. Supposing we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> that
the Upanihad is teaching that with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> as the nimittakAranam, an
efficient cause, all else becomes known. This proposal is defective because, everywhere
the karyam, effect, is known on the basis of its upadana karanam, the substance.
Supposing it is said: In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> there are many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that are popularly known after

26
their maker, the efficient cause. For example, paintings by Raja Ravi Varma, Picasso or
Da Vinci are famous only by the painter/artiste’s name and not by the material of canvas
or paint <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> therein. While this is not objected, when we see the example given by the
Chandogya Shruti we come to the firm conclusion that it is not the efficient cause that is
spoken of. The Shruti vakyam is: ekena mritpindena vijnAtena sarvam mrinmayam
vijnAtam syAt…, etc. When the material cause of one product of mud is known, all the
mud-products become known. In the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the painter/painting we cannot hold this rule
to be true. This is because, it is accepted by all that all (sarvam) the paintings of the past,
present and future universally are not the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> of Ravi Varma, Picasso or Da Vinci or
any single individual. Contrary to this, in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the material cause of an earthen pot
universally, at all times, it is mud alone. Further, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘mRNmayam’ has the suffix
‘mayat’ which gives the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of either vikaara, modification, or prAchurya,
predominance. Both ways, it is the material cause that fits as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of mayat.
What is clinching in the Upanishad is the expression: ‘mRttiketyeva satyam’ [as mud
alone (the mud-products) are real.] This shows beyond doubt that the Upanishad is
talking about the material cause and not the efficient cause, for, it does not say: ‘kulAla
ityeva satyam.’ [‘as potter alone the mud-products are real’]. When an effect is examined,
the maker is not discernible but the material is what is available as inhering in it. Also
that it is not the intention of the Shruti to teach that there is a maker of the universe and
that he is to be known. The drishtAnta <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the Shruti is not needed at all to teach this
well-known <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> invariably has a maker. This already well-known <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
does not constitute ‘vijnaanam’. That makes it clear that the Upanishad is talking about
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the material cause, Brahman, as the vijnanam required togain the

material cause and its effect) is not real.]
The Chandogya Upanishad teaching of ‘vAchArambhanam vikaaro nAmadheyam,
mRttiketyeva satyam’ is what is reflected in the above verse.

Maya is admitted. To appreciate this, the dream analogy could be considered:
In a dream, I <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> myself traveling in a bus in a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> Y; my real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of residence being
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> X. In the bus, I converse with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated beside me about the various landmarks
that I see as we move on. I witness several events outside the bus: a funeral procession,
a brawl, a minor accident, etc. The dream part is now over.
Now, analyzing the dream, have I undergone any modification by actually traveling to
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> Y, boarding a bus and riding through that city? Obviously no; I have been lying
on my bed in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">city</span> X. Did I make a sankalpa to witness all those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in the dream prior
to the commencement of the dream? No. It just happened by itself. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of sleep,
nidrAshakti, has conjured up the dream for me to witness. So, I am not the creator really
and I have not undergone any modification in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to create the dream scenes. Could
the nidrAshakti do the dream-creation all by itself? No, this is also not possible; it has to
happen only with my, a Conscious being’s, presence, although passive.
What we saw above is this: <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Creation</span> requires a shakti. This shakti cannot operate by
itself. It has to depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> Consciousness. This <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> is nirvikAri, nishkriya.
Despite the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> remaining passive, the shakti succeeds in creating a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
gamut of experiences. This consisted of creating a ‘me’ with a body-mind with which I
effortlessly identify myself. And the various relationships with a variety of persons,
events, objects, etc. that ‘I’ enter into and sustain. When I have woken up from the
dream I recall, quite justifiably: I saw myself as me, the others, time, space, etc. in the
dream. This is what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘vivarta’ of <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> as all the things/events that
appeared. This appearance could not have come up and existed and ended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> me,
the Conscious being lying on the bed. What is the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ‘role’ that I have played in
dream-creation? If at all there is a ‘role’ assignable to me, it is only a passive one; I have
just remained stay-put on the bed. My <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> was utilized by the shakti and the
dream-creation was projected. At best, my role has been that of a witness.
To apply the analogy to the jagat srishti: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the vivarta upAdaana kArana of the
jagat. No modification takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as a result of creation. Yet, the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span>
could not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as its basis. The Shakti that brings forth and sustains the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> has no existence independent of Brahman, the Chit. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> the Chit is the
adhishthAnam of the entire jagat and the shakti. The ‘role’ of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> in the jagat-srishti
is a passive one; It is just a sAkshi, witness. Saakshitvam can be understood as:
akartrutve sati bodhrtvam, ‘knowing sans acting’. This is what is spelt out by Bhagavan
in the Gita (IX.10): mayA adhyakshena prakritiH sUyate charaachram jagat, with Me as
a Witness, Prakriti brings forth the creation. Bhagavan makes His ‘role’ clear by denying
any kartritvam for Himself in creation: tasya kartAram api mAm viddhi akartAram
avyayam, na mey asti kartavyam, svabhAvastu pravartate, etc. His role is mere
adhyakshatvam, SAkshi. This conveys the Vedantic position of: 1. A Nishkriyam

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is a mere witness, 3.
Therefore, Consciousness, 4.The ‘doing’ part is that of Prakriti, 5. All these mean that

the one undergoing modification, is the pariNAmi upAdAna kaaranam, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is
just the vivarta upAdAna kAranam of creation, 6. The final Vedantic position is: The
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> is merely an appearance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> as the chara-acharam jagat through the
instrumentality/intervention/modification of Prakriti, Maaya. That is why we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
expressions like: Maayaa nirmitam jagat, Brahma kAryam jagat, etc. being variously
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in Vedantic works. While understanding these statements we have to keep in mind:
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is vivarta upAdaanam, MAyA is parinAmi upaadAnam and the jagat is an

Advaitam in the chaturtha pAda of this Upanishat. It is the realization of the Turiya

the ‘Bijam’ (seed), ‘pitA’ (Father), the Source of origin, sustenance and resolution of the
universe, etc. The Mandukya Upanishad (6) refers to Brahman/Ishwara as the ‘Yoni’
(womb) of the universe. These are references to the material-causehood of
Brahman/Ishwara. A mere efficient/intelligent cause like a painter or a potter or a
goldsmith is not seen in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to provide the essential ‘seed’ in the products that are
made. Certainly these makers are not the yoni, womb, of the products. The Brahmasutras
‘prakRtishcha …..’ (I.iv.23), ‘yonishcha hi gIyate’ (I.iv.27) teach that the Supreme is the
material cause of the universe. There are a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of Shruti passages that talk of the
material causehood of Brahman. For example, ‘kartAram Isham Purusham Brahma
yonim (Mundaka Up. 3.1.3), ‘yad bhUtayonim paripashyanti dhIrAH’ (Mundaka 1.1.6),
the Kaivalyopanishad ‘UmA-sahaayam Parameshwaram…..bhUtayonim…tamasaH
parastAt’ teach this same idea. The PANini Sutra (I.iv.30) ‘janikartuH prakRtiH’ teaches
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘prakRtiH’ means progenitor. There is nothing wrong in referring to the
PANini Sutra as VyAkaraNa is a valid VedAnga which aids in determining the purport of
the Veda. The lexicon ‘Amara kosha’ III.2480 says: ‘prakRtir-yoni-linge’. The
commentary thereon says: ‘yonau linge cha prakRtiH’.
Are the various insentient objects not different mutually?
Having seen that the chetana (Ishvara/jiva) - jaDa bheda is untenable in absolute terms,
we may now examine the position that the jaDa padarthas are mutually different. The
Gita says:
na tad asti pṛthivyāṃ vā divi deveṣu vā punaḥ
sattvaṃ prakṛtijair muktaṃ yad ebhiḥ syāt tribhir guṇaiḥ 18.40
The entire category <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘objects’, jaDa, kshetram, can be grouped under one name:
prakriti. The above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> says that there is no <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> in all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> worlds that is bereft
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gunas <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of prakriti/maya. The objects are different in their name, form,
utility, etc. But in essence, they are not different from each other. What is the essence
that is the unifying factor? It is the material cause of the objects/kshetram which is the
sattva-rajas-tamo-gunAtmikA mAyaa. In the manifest states of the waking and dream we
observe the variety in objects. In the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of sleep, all the objects resolve into their
cause, the undifferentiated state. Thus, it is not possible to establish any real bheda
between one jada <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> and another. All differences pertain to names/forms/utility, etc.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> another categorization of the entire gamut of the objective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is: shabda, sparsha,
rasa, etc. All the objects come under this five-fold category. This itself resolves into the
pancha-bhUtas that are the cause of the objects. The pancha-bhutas are again evolutes of
Maya. Thus, as the kArana prakriti, no kArya-vastu, object, is essentially different from
another.
The concept of abheda is possible in the realm of the jaDa prapancha as also in the

30
Chaitanyam. All bodies are a product of food, annam. On this basis there is no
difference between one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and another. The indwelling <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is also the same and no difference can be spoken of on that basis too. The dravya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

the pancha bhUtas which are again the evolutes of prakriti. Any difference is possible
only in the realm of nama-rUpa which is again taught by the Chandogya Shruti to be only
word-based and not substantial. The substance of everything in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> is ultimately
Brahman, Sat.
The essence of the consideration of the five’bhedas’(jIva-Ishvara bheda, jiva-jiva bheda,
jiva-jaDa bheda, Ishwara-jaDa bheda and jada-jada bheda) is contained in an
encapsulated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in the 7th mantra of the Mandukya Upanishat: ‘nAntaH prajnam….’
All duality is categorically negated as pertaining to the relatively real (mithya) realm, the
pAda-traya, and the Turiya is declared as the Absolute Truth: Advaitam Atma.
The Panchadashi, Chitra Deepa Prakaranam (Ch.VI) teaches the method of
comprehending the Non-dual Brahman/Atman by taking the example of a painting on a
cloth/canvas. We can show that the five bheda-s (considered above) are not real in the
absolute <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> by studying this example. Let us suppose we have a painting-on-canvas of
a scene of a market place. There are various people, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, different animals
like cows, dogs, sheep, etc., several birds like crows, pigeons and so on depicted in the
painting. There are many insentient objects like dress materials, <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> grains, sweet-meats,
soft drinks, etc. that are being sold there. There is a temple and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> go in and come
out of it.
What is fundamental to the above example is: the wide variety of sentient and insentient
entities is having one common base, the canvas. Although the outlines, the colour, the
presence of clothing on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and its absence on animals, cars, cycles, etc. differ, the
entire ‘difference’ stands on the one substratum, the canvas. The five bheda-s are
observable only on the surface but when the substratum canvas is considered, the bheda-s
no longer matter. The shopkeeper-customer (jiva-jiva) difference, the shopkeeperfoodgrain (jiva-jaDa) difference, the temple Deity-devotee (Ishwara-jiva) difference, the
food-grain-cycle (jaDa-jaDa) difference, temple Deity-temple bell (Ishwara-jaDa)
difference are all perceived only apparently but fade into insignificance the moment it is
realized that the entire gamut of variety stands on one common substratum, the canvas. It
is to be noted that the variety of objects, sentient and insentient, has no existence apart
from the canvas on which they are painted. The objects cannot be ‘separated’ from the
canvas.
The canvas is the One Non-dual Consciousness, the Sat, Chit, Ananta Brahman/Atman,
the drk. The variety, drishya, is only a superimposition on this substratum. The variety
has no existence apart from the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> on which it appears.
The consideration of a dream, as an analogy, also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the same results as
above. The Shruti says: na iha nAnaa asti kinchana (No difference whatsoever exists
here in Brahman).

31
The five bheda-s were <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up for consideration not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a purpose. All bheda,
duality, forms the subject matter of aparaa vidyaa, the sciences that pertain to the world.
The Veda too has this portion when it teaches the purusharthas of dharma, artha and
kAma. But when it comes to Moksha, the vidya takes the name of ‘parA vidyA’. This
field of the Shastra is essentially the one that transcends bheda, duality. The main
purport and purpose of the Vedanta, the Upanishads, is to teach abheda and only in this
the Upanishads become the indispensable pramana. While bheda, duality, is perceived
naturally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being instructed, abheda is not; it requires to be instructed with effort
and understood with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> effort. It is towards this end the Upanishads endeavour. Says
Sri Shankara Bhagavatpada in His commentary to the mantra 5.1.1 of the Brihararanyaka
Upanishad:
//na upadeshArham dvaitam, jAta-mAtra-prAni-buddhi-gamyatvAt.//
[Duality does not require to be instructed (by the Veda) since it (duality) is perceived by
every being even at birth.]

volumes? Reply: The Veda is actually refining the duality that is initially crude by
making it conducive to the grasping of the ultimate teaching of Advaitam. All kinds of
duality like: he is different and I am different, I am his/her son/daughter, I am dependent
on him/her for my sustenance/wellbeing, etc. is cognized by every being even untutored.
Even a just <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> baby or pup or calf looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the mother for being fed and security.
This dependence on an external source continues as the child grows up. It looks up to the
teacher for knowledge. The grown up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the employer, sva-svAmi-bhAva,
for monetary benefits and to lead a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of happiness. The Veda takes this forward and
teaches us that we have to look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> Ishwara for our wellbeing. It teaches us the
existence of other worlds and helps us in attaining these by adhering to the means
prescribed therein. It teaches us that the karmaphala dhAta is Ishwara and He is the One
that can grant us the Parama PurushArtha, Moksha. All this is the refinement the Veda
does in the realm of duality. It is only when it comes to the instruction pertaining to
Moksha, the Veda takes a quantum jump, as witnessed in the Mandukya 7th mantra, and
negates all duality, totally and holds out the Advaitic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> as the means for Moksha
which itself is ShAntam, Shivam, Advaitam.

The analysis conducted above gives rise to a situation where the status of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is in

This very teaching is <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out by the Veda/Upanishads in several ways:
‘yatra hi dvaitam iva bhavati…..’ ‘mRtyoH sa mRtyum gacchati ya iha nAna iva
pashyati’, ‘vAchArambhaNam vikAro nAmadheyam’, ‘sarvANi rUpANi vichitya
dhIraH nAmAni kRtvA abhivadan…’ By using the particle ‘iva’, the Upanishad says that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> existent but not really.
The above Gita verses also <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out the vivartopAdana-kAraNatvam of Brahman. This
is akin to the rope being a ‘material cause’ for the appearing snake. The rope has
certainly not provided any of its material to the snake appearance except its existence
which is the foundation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the perceiver imagines a snake. The rope only
appears to be a snake for this perceiver. Brahman, by not inhering in the world, does not
lend any real material for the world. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is only appearing as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to the one
who perceives the world. This is what is termed as the vivartopAdanatvam of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
in respect of the world. The Chandogya Shruti ‘vAchArambhaNam vikAro
nAmadheyam, mRttiketyeva satyam’ teaches that the various products of clay are mere
appearances of clay; their substance is only clay. In giving this analogy, the Upanishad
teaches that the world, a product of Brahman, is only an appearance of Brahman; its
substance is Brahman. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> it is insubstantial.

This is what is elaborately <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out by
the Bhashyakara in the Adhyasa Bhashya. The ‘adhyAsa Bhashya’ contains an analogy:
ekashchandraH sa-dvitIyavad, ‘the really only one moon appearing as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> in
number’. The <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the ‘two birds’ is similar to this and the Mundaka Shruti is alluding
to this common error on the part of the deluded jivas by initially ‘approving’ it and later
correcting the vision.
Now, looking at the above quoted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> once again, we get this insight: The dvitIyA
vibhakti, accusative case, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> 15.10 is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> significance. Supposing the police
is looking for a criminal named Mohan. They know that he is speeding away in a car,
identified by the police. They have an informant with them and are closely following the
criminal’s car. That car contains five others also. Now, the police want to know who
among the five is Mohan so that in <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> they have to shoot him, they should not be
making a mistake. So, they ask the informant to identify Mohan. The informant looks
into the car and identifies: ‘The one who is driving is Mohan.’
Now, in the present context we have a similar identification made by the Gita. It says:
The one who is seen to be involved in samsara as a kartA-bhoktA, endowed with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> guNas, who is subject to birth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and transmigration, is Brahman. The dvitIyA

34
vibhakti is significant in this <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of identifying the chaitanyam with jIvatvOpAdhi as
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> that is to be realized as nirupAdhika chaitanyam. This realization confers
liberation. This is stated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> 15.11. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> ‘enam’ ‘this one’, and ‘ātmany
avasthitam’ ‘one established in the intellect’ convey the MahAvAkyArtha that the
chaitanyam seen to be endowed with jivatvopAdhi in the earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is the chaitanyam
that is seated in the intellect. That it is Ishwara chaitanyam that is seated in everyone’s
intellect is taught by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in this very chapter: sarvasya chAham hRdi
sanniviShTo…I am seated in everyone’s intellect…..
Just as the Police apprehend Mohan for his crime and not for his driving or wearing
denims, the aspirant, by invoking the JnanachakshuH, apprehends the Pure
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> by discarding the jivatopadhi-dharmas which are only incidental and not
svarUpa dharma.
It is gaining this vision that is spoken of as ‘jnAna chakshUs’ by the Gita.

Perception of duality and the Jivanmukta
//The Advaitic concept of a jîvanmukta is also absurd because a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who has
surmounted the realm of perception and realized the Absolute (as Advaita holds of a
mukta) should not continue to exist <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> and interact with the realm of perception that
he has realized as being not-Real—no one continues to perceive a snake after realizing
that the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of his perception is actually a rope. The suggestion that such bondage to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of perception continues for a while after the occurrence of Realization, because
of past attachments, is not tenable—such attachments themselves are artifacts of the
perceived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that has supposedly been sublated, and should not continue to besiege
the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the Realized. If they do, then we have to either reject the Realization
that is said to have occurred, or else reject the notion that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of perception, as
manifesting through the attachments on a supposedly Realized person, can be sublated. In
either instance, the notion of jîvanmukti is not meaningful. //
Reply: The objection has stemmed out of an improper understanding of the
Vedanta/Advaita prakriya. The analogy of rope-snake is not very appropriate in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span>
of jivanmukti. This analogy suits the explanation of the adhyasa and its removal. But
what condition prevails post-adhyasa-removal is not clearly <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out by this example.
To explain this state, the other example, employed by the Acharya, of mirage-water is
what is apt. The Acharya has explained this in the Gita(?) bhashyam (ref.) We can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span>
the example and apply it in the modern context:
Supposing, I am driving on a highway on a summer day. The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> risen and in
the noon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there is formation of mirages on the highway ahead of me. Actually there
is no formation of mirage; it is only an appearance of the mirage to me, the perceiver,
from a particular spot and angle. When the spot/angle is changed, the appearance ceases.
Nevertheless, when I maintain the position and angle even while driving, there are
chances that I continue to see mirages as I proceed. At the first instance, if I am new to

35
that locality, I might mistake it for a water-spread, puddle, on the road and might even
exercise caution to avoid any skidding and regulate my speed. But the moment I realize
that it is after all a mirage, I am no longer cautious in that respect. I drive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> that
aspect engaging my mind, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I continue to see mirages almost upto 4 in the
afternoon on the highway.
Similar is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> with the Mukta who has known that the perception-based prapancha is
unreal. By ‘sublation’ what is meant is: the satyatva buddhi of the aropita vastu is
destroyed. It is not necessary that the aropita vastu itself should go out of (perceptual)
existence. If this is not admitted and appreciated there will be problem in explaining
various actions of the Mukta. For example, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says that the Tattvadarshi, when
approached in the appropriate manner, will impart the Atmavidya to the jijnasu. If the
Tattvadarshi were to himself become non-existent soon after the dawn of knowledge,
how is valid tattvopadesha possible, as mentioned by the Lord? To carry out the
tattvopadesha, the Mukta (‘Muktashcha anyAn vimochayEt’ is a part of a famous shloka:
durjanassajjano bhUyAt/sajjanH shAntimApnuyAt/shAnto muchyeta
bandhebhyaH/muktashcha anyAn vimochayet//) has to ‘perceive’ the jignasu and see him
as ‘another’, listen to his questions, doubts, etc. and give out the teaching suitably. All
this can happen only if the perception-based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is remaining intact, although for the
Tattvadarshi it is only asatya. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> echoes this <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> when He says:

because, as taught by the Lord:

quite possible in the manner taught by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the verses 5.8 and 9 above. This is one

firm realization that naiva kiṃcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattvavit (I never perform
these actions). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is talking of these actions for a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who is alive and not to a
one who has departed from the world. The usage of the ‘shatr’ pratyaya in the words:
paśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighrann aśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan 5.8
pralapan visṛjan gṛhṇann unmiṣan nimiṣann api 5.9 are noteworthy. This pratyaya
indicates a present continuous tense where even when the action is going on, the
realization that one is not the doer is present. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.v.15)
gives the larger picture of this <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of Jivanmukti which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> stated in the verses just

Supposing, someone does not want to admit jivanmukti. Let us consider the situation of
a Tattvadarshi imparting jnanam to a jijnaasu. The Gita says the Tattvadarshi sees
Atman/Brahman, Bhagavan everywhere and in everything. Now, the Jnani sees This in
the jijnasu too. Since the jijnasu is Brahman/Atman, where is the need to teach him? To
avoid this situation, one will have to say: Although the jijnasu is Brahman/Atman from
the Tattvadarshi’s standpoint, to the jijnasu this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> aparoksha.

As we saw above, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> as Sri Rama and Sri Krishna did experience pain and pleasure
in their lives. They did <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span> and sleep. If these are the parameters to judge <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> a
tattvavit is a mukta or not, then we have to question the realization of Sri Rama and
Krishna and put them under the ‘supposedly Realized persons’ category. For, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> said ‘does not inhere in Me = na cha matsthAni bhUtAni’ (in other words,

The shastra says: ‘na tasya prAnaaH utkrAmanti….’. Aparoksha jnanam and the
jivanmukti that results give a guarantee to the Jnani the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of this mantra. He knows by

that he will become mukta only after death, this mantra is invalid, aprAmANika.
Therefore, for the rule ‘JnAnaan MokshaH’ to be true, jivanmukti has to be admitted.

This line of the Bhagavatam teaches that the jiva, in truth, is Ishwara. There are several
Shruti vakyams that teach that it is Ishwara Himself that is appearing as the jiva. For
example, the Chandogya Upanishat VI.iii.2 says: ‘anena jIvena AtmanA anu-pravishya
…. ‘ [Let me enter in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of each <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> being ….]
ajAyamAno bahudhA vijAyate [He who is never born, takes birth as multifarious

Bhagavadgita verse: Mamaivaamsho jIvaloke jIvabhUtaH sanaatanaH….of the 15th ch.
also clearly says that the jiva is only an amsha of Ishwara.

Objection: It is improper to say that the jiva in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is Ishwara Himself. The Mundaka
mantra (III.i.1): dvA suparna…..clearly distinguishes the jiva and Ishwara as different
entities.
Reply: While this is what appears to be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of that mantra, one has to look at the
mantra in a larger context.
Supposing a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has seen a snake in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where actually only a rope is there. When
he reports to another <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> about his ‘sighting’ a snake and its ‘presence’ there, he is
actually under the belief that the snake ‘is’ there. Now, supposing the other <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who
is familiar with that spot knows for sure that it is only a rope <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> behind by some
workers, he tries to convince the deluded <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> about the truth.
Where is the snake?
There, in that spot.
No, it is not a snake. It is a rope.
No, it is indeed a snake; I could not have mistaken.
OK. Let us go to the spot where (you say) the snake is and verify.
So, they go to the spot; the deluded <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> holding that the snake ‘is’ there and the other
one only seemingly agreeing that it is there. He knows that there are no ‘two’ entities
there: a rope and a snake. He knows that the illusory snake cannot be counted as another
entity after the only entity, the rope. If he says categorically ‘the snake is not there, it is a
rope,’ as he did say, the deluded one is not going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> it; he is not mentally prepared to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the truth. He is in need of further instruction. Until the further instruction is given,
by showing the truth, the instructor has to appear to be in agreement; for that message is
conveyed to the deluded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> by the very agreeing to go to the spot.
What we have in the Mundaka mantra cited above is similar to this example. The Shruti
knows that there are no ‘two’ entities in the body-tree. The illusory ‘jiva’-bird cannot be
counted along with the Sakshi-bird. The ‘paramam sAmyam’, the aikyam, that the Shruti
teaches in the subsequent mantras of the Mundaka Upanishad is ample proof for the
Shruti not holding the bhokta-bird as absolutely real.[Reference to the Gita 15.10 and 11
verses discussed above could be made for clarification on this point.] The mithya cannot
be counted along with the satyam. The ‘sAmyam’ mentioned here could be understood in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of ‘nirdosham hi samam brahma’, ‘samam sarvatra pashyan samavasthitam
Ishwaram’, ‘samam sarveshu bhUteshu… ‘ of the Bhagavad Gita. ‘SAmyam’ can mean
identity only for the Shruti denies any ‘other’ entity that is equal to or like Brahman:
Na tat samashcha abhyadhikashcha drishyate

43
Na tasya pratimA asti

(Shvetashvataropanishat VI.8 and IV.19)

The Shruti cannot in one go demolish the jiva-identity. It accepts, as it were,
(abhyupetya) initially, that jiva is a separate entity entangled in samsara. So it specifies
that these are the ‘two’ birds in the body-tree. Once the jiva starts ‘gazing’ at the Sakshi,
under the teaching of the proper Guru, the Guide, the sadhana will progress and
culminate in his gradually giving up his ‘separate’ identity and appreciate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> of the
secondless Unity of the Sakshi. The subsequent mantras of the ‘dvaa-suparna’ teach
exactly this.
The earlier cited Bhagavatam <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> teaches that the mind-body complex is unreal. The
ultimate message we get from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Bhagavatam verses is: When the jiva is separated,
as taught in the Kshetra adhyaya, from the mind-body complex, what remains is One
(Supreme) Self alone; there is nothing to identify someone as ‘jiva’. This conclusion is
relevant in the context of jivanmukti while discussing the ‘unreality’ of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of
perception. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> ‘kalpitam avivekena’ of the earlier Bhagavatam <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is of
particular significance.
Why is the ‘dvA suparNa’ mantra not pAramArthika ?

The mantra occurs in the Mundakopanishat III.3.1.
In this mantra the jiva is shown as the karma-phala bhOkta, the experiencer of the fruits
of his karma. When we look at the teaching about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the jeeva, as taught
in the Bhagavadgita, for example, we know that the jiva is not born, does not die, etc.
For an entity that has no birth at all, there cannot be the mind, prana, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> apparatus (all
evolutes of prakriti, kshetram, from which one has to discriminate oneself and become
free). It is possible to have ignorance, desire, action, karma, fruit of karma, experiencing
of the fruit etc., only when this apparatus is available. But in this mantra we have the
jiva portrayed as not someone who is <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from birth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> but who is in samsara.
This itself shows that the jiva as a samsari spoken of here is not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the jiva.
But everyone in ignorance experiences to be a samsari. This unenquired-into experience
of everyone is being alluded to in this mantra and hence it is only a depiction of the
vyavaharika <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> and not the absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> of the jiva.
No system that promises moksha to the jiva has for its goal the retention of the above
samsaric bhokta <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of the jiva. All systems endeavour to portray the jiva as <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from
samsara. This is the pAramArthika state. This free-of-samsara <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of the jiva is what is
taught in the subsequent mantras. That is one <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> why the mantra ‘dvaa suparna’ is
not the one teaching the absolutely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the jiva but only the depiction of the
vyavaharic state.
When the separation from the kshetram is successfully accomplished, the realization that
one is no different from the ‘Other’ bird, Paramaatman, is had. For, when the kshetram

44
is separated, there will be nothing to finitize the Atman and consider It to be different
from the ParamAtman.
Moreover, the mantra speaks of the ‘body’ tree where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> birds, Paramaatma and
jeevaatma, are perched, as it were. In the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of moksha no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> will be there for the
mukta for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> birds to be located. There will be no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of specifying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> birds or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> entities the Para and jeeva Atmans. If it is held that there will still be a body, then
that will be no moksha at all for the freedom from prakriti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have been
accomplished. For this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> too, the ‘dvaa suparna’ imagery is not absolute but only a
temporary acceptance, abhyupetya, by the Shruti.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> another <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> as to why this can be only an imagery and not the paramaartha tattva:
The mantra says the jeeva bird is busy experiencing karma phala. This can happen only
in the realm of artha, kaama and dharma purusharthas. But in Moksha purushartha, the
very purpose of which is to <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> the jeeva from the earlier cycle of samsara of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
other lower purusharthas, there will be no bhoga-bhogya-bhokta triputee (triad). So the
jeeva is just one Pure <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> freed from all bhoga instruments and bhoga objects.
This is taught by the subsequent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mantras culminating in the ‘paramam sAmyam’.

To the seer, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have verily become the Self: what delusion, what sorrow, can
there be for him who beholds that oneness? //
The above Upanishads convey the message that release from
desires/delusion/sorrow is what is meant by liberation from samsara. The liberated
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> is experienced here, in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> itself, by those Jnanis who have secured the
aparoksha jnanam.
[The Bhagavadgita II <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> verse: prajahAti yadA kAmAn sarvAn pArtha
manogatAn…specifying the sthitaprajna lakshana is the reflection of the above Shruti
passages. This is the jivanmukta lakshana.]
Is experience a proof for reality?
In normal parlance, that is, vyavahara, it is held that what is experienced is a proof
for the reality of the experience. Since this rule does not hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in the field of
Absolute Reality, the transcendtal realm, the Scripture teaches the aspirant to
question this rule and grow out of this misconception.
For example, all of us believe that we are born, grow, perform actions, get old, suffer
disease, experience joy and sorrow and finally die. Those who are believers hold
that we transmigrate and are <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> again. While this is the common thinking, the
Bhagavadgita, for example, teaches us something that is quite contrary to this
thinking. In the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Second</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that we, the Consciousness, are
never <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> and we never die. We are never destroyed/destroyable by any force in
the creation. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> ch. He teaches that we are not the doers of any action; only
the prakriti, Maya, does everything. ‘The Atma is akartaa’ teach the 13th and 14th
chapters. While we think we are many, distinct, entities, the Gita teaches that the
right vision is the seeing of the One Conscious Principle in all the seemingly distinct
bodies. It censures the seeing of difference as rajasic and tamasic.
The 15th ch. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> ‘utkrAmantam…..’ also proves that contrary to our experience of
an embodied life, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> is that we are the asanga, asamsaari Atman.

Thus, quite contrary to our thinking that experience is a proof of reality, the
scriptures teach that this thinking is incorrect.

Objection:

Why does Tattvavâda deny jîvan-mukti?
//Because a mukta, or liberated person, should not even be physically present in the
material universe, unlike the un-liberated. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who is living in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> cannot be
said to be <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> of sorrow <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of material contact, and also cannot be said to experience
the joy of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> at all times. The very act of living in a gross material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
entails <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> such as eating, sleeping, pleasure and pain, etc., which cannot be accepted
in a mukta.
Here is a reply to the above:
The Upanishad teaches ‘The knower of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is Brahman’ ‘Brahma veda Brahmaiva’
(Mundaka). In the Srivishnusahasranama we have a name: ‘Brahmavit’, ‘AnandaH’, etc..
If it is contended that while in the gross <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> one (a Tattvadarshi) cannot experience the
svarupa-ananda at all times, we will have to conclude that Bhagavan, as Sri Rama and Sri
Krishna, was devoid of svarupa-ananda during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of these incarnations. If it is said
that a Brahmavit is different from Brahman, there will be contradiction to the Shruti
vakyam quoted above and also the absurd consequence of Vishnu, Brahman, being
different from Himself (Brahmavit).
In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the above, we have to admit that the Brahmavit, Jivanmukta, being nondifferent from Brahman, does experience His svarupa-ananda while in the body. The
Acharyapaada makes an observation in the Taittiriya Bhashyam on ‘raso vai saH…(II.7):
bAhyAnanda-sAdhana-rahitA api nirIhA nireShaNA .brAhmanAH bAhyarasalAbhAdiva sAnandaa dRShyante vidvAmsaH, nUnam brahmaiva rasaH teShAm.
//The Brahmavits are seen to be ever-satisfied with the Ananda of their nature, svarupa,
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they are deriving the joy from external objects. These Tattvadarshis are <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span>
from desire. It is certain that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> alone is the ‘rasa’ of these Jnanis. //

Atman. This is svarupa ananda anubhava. If this <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> were only a temporary one, the
jnani will not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a sthita-prajna. The prajnaa-sthairya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be meaningful only
when the tushti is available to him always.
In the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> chapter, we have:

In the above verses too, we have the proof of jivanmukti. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> says that this

the Tattvadarshi remaining in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and still enjoying the Svarupa ananda; there is no
need to die for this. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> further emphasizes that this <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of the jivanmukta is no
different from His (the Lord’s) own <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> (3.22) wherein the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is (also) <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from any

all. The Jnani who has realized his pUrnatva is spoken of by the Gita thus:

Again compare the above with the Lord’s declaration of His own PUrNatva and the
consequent transcendence from ‘compelled kartavyatva’ (3.22).

Tattvadarshi, even while living in the body. The bliss is the Greatest, verily the bliss of
Brahman. What more proof is needed to show that the svarupa Ananda is experienced by
the Tattvadarshi, jivanmukta, while in the gross body? The ‘sarvAtmatva drishti’ gained
by the Jnani enables him to have the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> of the Self at all times; it is never lost

jivanmukti.
CONCLUSION
The core teaching of the Bhagavadgita begins from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> 2.11:
śrībhagavān uvāca
aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṃ prajñāvādāṃś ca bhāṣase
gatāsūn agatāsūṃś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ 2.11
From this seminal teaching we understand:
1. To grieve for those alive and those who have departed is ignorance.
2. It is ignorance because whatever happens to those who live is happening to the
body-mind complex and not to the Atman. Likewise, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> occurs to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
only and not to the Atman.
3. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that the Atman is ‘na jAyate’ (never born), ‘na mriyate’ (never
dies).
4. Everyone knows that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is assigned only if it is born.
5. Since Atman is never born, It is different from the body; it cannot possess a body.
6. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that we are the Atman in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which is not our

is ignorance. It is only because we have ‘taken’ ourselves to be the body-mind
that we grieve for what happens to the body-mind. The Scriptures endeavor to
correct this mistake. To think that we are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is ignorance, ajnana, avidya.
To gain the <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> that we are the Atman and not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is jnana, vidya.

7. That which is corrected by vidya, jnana, is ajnana, avidya. The ‘we-are-the-body’
(and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> finite) <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is corrected by the jnana ‘I am the Atman’ (and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> am the Infinite Brahman) .Hence the body-idea is Avidyaka. It could be
objected: What is corrected by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> need not be unreal. It could very <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
be anitya. To grieve for something that is anitya is ignorance and this is what is
corrected by the scripture. To this the reply is: ‘anitya’ by definition is something
that was not there before and will not be there later but is there only in the present.
That which is absent before and after is deemed to be absent even in the
intervening present. Ultimately, ‘anitya’ is not different from ‘mithya’. The
following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> closely connected verses of the Gita Ch.II could be studied:
mātrāsparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇasukhaduḥkhadāḥ
āgamāpāyinonityās tāṃs titikṣasva bhārata 2.14
nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ
ubhayor api dṛṣṭo.antas tv anayos tattvadarśibhiḥ 2.16
While the former talks about ‘anityatva’, the latter teaches the mithyAtva of
phenomena. Both the verses occur in the context of forbearance, titikshA.
Forbearance is on stronger ground when one realizes that the phenomena encountered
are not real and they are only appearing to be present. Their ‘asat’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> when
realized brings about greater peace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and renders the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> more conducive for
‘tattva dharshanam’.
8. All those who accept that the Atman is different from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> have to admit that
the body-idea is <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of ignorance. Since Jnana corrects this ignorance and since
this happens when one is alive, it has to be logically concluded that the body-idea
is only a superimposition on the Atman. And the superimposition goes when
right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Atman arises. Since the scriptures do not say that the
dawn of right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is coeval with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the body, and since
samsaritva is terminated by right knowledge, the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of the Jnani is the liberated
state, moksha.
9. To remain in the body-idea is samsara. Samsara is karta-bhokta bhava. This is
what is amply borne out by the ‘dvaa-suparna’ mantra of the Mundaka Upanishad
and the ‘utkrAmantam shtitam vAapi….’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> of the Gita 15th ch. He who is a
samsari is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a jiva.
10. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> teaches that the Atman is akarta-abhokta. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the Atman is not a
jiva, samsari.The Jnani has discarded the body-idea. He has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> freed himself
from samsara and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> a mukta.
11. That such is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> is taught by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the verses: The jnani knows that he
is not the doer/enjoyer ‘naiva kinchit karomi…’even while the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> organs are
operating, ‘pashyan, shrunvan, etc.’ This is said by the Shruti vakyam: 'sachakshurachakshuriva, sa-karno'karna iva, sa-manA amanA iva, sa-prANo'prAna
iva'. [even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he is with eyes, ears, etc., he is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> them.’]
12. In the said Gita verses: naiva kinchit karomi…..the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is teaching that the
world/body that is sublated by samyagdarshanam will continue for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> till

the fall of the body. This is called: bAdhita-anuvritti. The bodily functions and
interaction of the senses with the objects will continue due to the past momentum
but the Jivanmukta himself will remain disassociated from them. This is what is
conveyed by the words: pashyan, shrunvan, etc. of the Gita.
13. Since the Jnani’s identification with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has ceased, he is actually ‘asharIri’.
This is said in the Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.12.1): ‘ashrIram vaa va santam na
priya-apriye sprushataH’ [That which is bereft of body-identification is untouched
by joy and sorrow.] Being afflicted by joy and sorrow is samsara (ref: dvaa
suparnaa). Freedom from joy-sorrow is what moksha is: paramam sAmyam.
14. The Brihadaranyaka mantra (IV.iv.13) ‘Atmaanam ched vijAnIyAt ‘ayam asmi’
iti pUruShaH, kim icchan kasya kAmAya sharIram anu sanjvaret’ is relevant in
this context. ‘If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> knows the Self as ‘I am this’, then desiring what and for

something and avoiding something is what is denoted by samsara. When
someone transcends this by right knowledge, the connection with the body-idea
ceases. The right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gained is that of one’s pUrNatva. This <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
‘tripti’. When a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> has no <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> out of ignorance, he is stated to be
sated completely. Swami Vidyaranya writes one <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of 298 verses in the
Panchadashi under the title ‘Tripti Deepa prakaranam’ expounding the deep
purport of this mantra. The Gita too teaches that the Jnani is ‘nitya tripta’ and
does not depend on anything in the world. This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Jivanmukti. That the
‘svarUpa Ananda’ is experienced by the Jnani (while living) is also borne out by
the Gita.
15. To put the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> in a nut-shell: (a) freedom from samsara (b) experience of
tripti and (c) experience of svarupa ananda which are the hallmarks of moksha
can be had while the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is alive. The Shruti, smriti, yukti and vidwadanubhava are all pramanas for this. If someone questions/denies Jivanmukti it is
evident that: (1) he has not understood the purport of the moksha shastra (2) has
not had genuine Aupanishada advaita Atma sAkshAtkara. Jivan mukti is an
undeniable <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> of experience to the one who has had the direct realization of the
Atman/Brahman. Says Bhagavatpada Shankara in the Bhashyam on Brahma
Sutra (IV.1.15):

This
very <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> is elaborated in the Upanishads and Smritis in the course of determining

Truth. Sri Shankaracharya has raised the objections, very similar to the ones
contained in the ‘TattvavAda’-criticism of the Vedantic <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of Jivanmukti, and
answered them in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya for the mantra: I.iv.10
where occurs the Mahavakya ‘aham BrahmAsmi’. This could be read on pages
114 onwards, especially page 116, in the English translation by
Sw.Madhavananda published by Advaita Ashrama.
The unmistakable Freedom from samsara, Moksha/Mukti, directly experienced by
the Aproksha Jnani, even while alive, as <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out in the Aitareya Upanishad,
immediately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> obtaining the Jnanam is the incontrovertible, undeniable
Upanishadic Proof for Jivanmukti. If someone who has no such personal
experience of being freed from samsara/ajnana is considered to be a Tattvajnani
(who may or may not attain moksha after death), the Tattvajnanam had is
questionable. For, the very infallible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of genuine Tattvajnanam is its
immediate fuit of clearly experienceable freedom.
‘While still in the womb of my mother I obtained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all the births
of these gods. Hundred numerous citadels, bodies, of iron, that is, as if made of
iron, held me. Then forcefully by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> I came out
like a hawk tearing through a net.’ Vamadeva said this in this manner while
remaining in the womb itself.// (II.1.5)
The above quote is also ample proof for the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the teaching of Moksha is
verifiable even while living by one who gets the Jnanam. If jivanmukti is not
accepted, one has no certainty in the occurrence of the fruit of Moksha taught by

52
the Upanishads. It is always a ‘he may attain moksha after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> if ….conditions
