INTRODUCTION.

I finished the Preface to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> volume of my translation of the Hymns to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> with the following words:

'The second volume, which I am now preparing for Press, will contain the remaining hymns addressed to the Maruts. The notes will necessarily have to be reduced to smaller dimensions, but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> always constitute the more important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in a translation or, more truly, in a deciphering of Vedic hymns.'

This was written more than twenty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, but <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Vedic scholarship has advanced with giant steps, I still hold exactly the same opinion which I held then with regard to the principles that ought to be followed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> translators of the Veda. I hold that they ought to be decipherers, and that they are bound to justify <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of their translation in exactly the same manner in which the decipherers of hieroglyphic or cuneiform inscriptions justify <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> step they take.

It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that Professor von Roth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of our most eminent Vedic scholars, holds the very opposite opinion.

Prof. von Roth brings forward no passage where mimikshire is used in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which he uses it here, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> again, his rendering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be poetical, but it is not scholarlike.

To translate arkanti sushmam by 'das Pfeifen klingt,' is, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> the least, very free. Sushma comes, no doubt, from svas, to breathe, and the transition of <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> from breath to strength is intelligible enough. In the Psalms we read (xviii. 15), 'At the blast of the breath of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> nostrils the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> were discovered.' Again (Job iv. 9), 'By the blast of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed; 'Isaiah xi. 4, 'And with the breath of his lips <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> he slay the wicked.'

But when, as in VI, 19, 8, sushma has the adjectives dhanasprit, sudaksha, we can hardly translate it by anything but strength. When, therefore,

[p. xiv]

von Roth translates sushma by whistling, and arkanti by sounding, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> demur.

Why not translate, they sing their strength, i. e. the Maruts, by their breathing or howling. proclaim themselves their strength? We find a similar idea in I, 87, 3, 'the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> have themselves glorified their greatness.' <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">Neither</span> Grassmann nor Ludwig venture to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> sushma in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of whistle, or arkanti in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of sounding. Bergaigne seems to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> vrishanah as a genitive, referring to Indra, 'ils chantent la force a Indra,' which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been the original meaning, but seems hardly appropriate when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> is placed in the mouth of Indra himself (Journ. Asiat. 1884, p. 199). Sushma <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> occurs as an adjective. The passages in which von Roth admits sushma as an adjective are not adequate. Does mitgeboren in German convey the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of sanilah, 'of the same nest?'

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 2.

The second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> contains few difficulties, and is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> rendered by von Roth:

'An wessen Spruchen freuen sich die Jungen?
   Wer lenkt die Marut her zu seinem Opfer?
 Gleich Falken streichend durch den Raum der Lufte--

'Wie kommt es, Indra, dass du sonst so munter,
   Heut' ganz alleine fahrst, sag an Gebieter!
 Du pflegtest auf der Fahrt mit uns zu plaudern
   Was <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> du wider uns, sprich, Rosselenker!'

Von Roth takes kutah in a causal sense, why? I believe that kutah <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> occurs in that <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in the Rig-veda. If it does, passages should be produced to prove it.

Ma'hinah can <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be translated by 'sonst so munter.' This imparts a modern idea which is not in the original.

[p. xv]

Subhanaih does not mean auf der Fahrt, and plaudern, adopted from Grassmann, instead of sam prikkhase, introduces again quite a modern idea. Ludwig calls such an idea 'abgeschmackt,' insipid, which is rather strong, but not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> wrong.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 4.

Von Roth:

'Ich liebe Spruche, Wunsche und die Tranke,
   Der Duft steigt auf, die Presse ist gerustet;
 Sie flehen, locken mich mit ihrem Anruf,
   Und meine Fuchse fuhren mich zum Mahle.'

It is curious how quickly all difficulties which beset the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> line seem to vanish in a metrical translation, but the scholar should face the difficulties, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the poet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> evade them.

To translate sushmah iyarti by 'der Duft steigt auf,' the flavour of the sacrifices rises up, is more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Grassmann ventures on. It is simply impossible. Benfey (Entstehung der mit r anlautenden Personalendungen, p. 34) translates: 'My thunderbolt, when hurled by me, moves mightily.'

Again, prabhritah me adrih does not mean die Presse ist gerustet. Where does Indra ever speak of the stones used for pressing the Soma as my stone, and where does prabhritah ever mean gerustet?

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 5.

Von Roth:

'So werden wir und mit uns unsre Freunde (Nachbarn),
   Die freien Manner, unsre Rustung nehmen,
 Und lustig unsre Schecken alsbald schirren.
   Du kommst uns eben ganz nach Wunsch, o Indra.'

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> lines are unnecessarily free, and the last decidedly wrong. How can svadha'm anu hi nah babhu'tha mean 'Du kommst uns eben ganz nach Wunsch?' Svadha does not mean wish, but nature, custom, wont (see I, 6, 4, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> 2; and Bergaigne, Journ.

Babhutha <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> 'thou <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> become,' not 'thou comest.'

Von Roth:

'Da war's auch nicht so ganz nach Wunsch, o Maruts,
   Als ihr allein mich gegen Ahi schicktet!
 Ich aber kraftig, tapfer, unerschrocken,
   Ich traf die Gegner alle mit Geschossen.'

The only doubtful line is the last. Von Roth's former translation of nam, to bend <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from, to escape from (cf. feugu and bhug), seems to me still the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> one. He now translates 'I directed my arrow on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> enemy,' when the genitive, as ruled by anamam, requires confirmation. As to sam adhatta I certainly think von Roth's last interpretation better than his first. In the Dictionary he explained samdha in our passage by to implicate. Grassmann translated it by to leave or to desert, Ludwig by to employ. I took it formerly in the usual <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of joining, so that yat mam ekam samadhatta should be the explanation of svadha, the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> custom that you should join me when I am alone. But the construction is against this, and I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> altered my translation, so that the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> is, Where was that <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> custom you speak of, when you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> me to be alone, i. e. when you left me alone, in the fight with Ahi? The udatta of anamam is not irregular, because it is preceded by hi.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 7.

Von Roth:

   Mit uns, o Held, wir mit vereinter Starke,
 Gewaltiges vermogen wir, du machtiger

By this translation, the contrast between 'thou <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> done <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> with us,' and 'Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> once more,' is lost. Krinavama expresses an exhortation, not a simple fact, and on this point Grassmann's metrical translation is decidedly preferable.

What I miss is the accent on the I. Perhaps this <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> stronger by translating:

As to karishya'h instead of karishya', the reading of the MSS., Roth is inclined to adopt my conjecture, as supported by the analogous passage in IV, 30, 23. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> which Ludwig quotes as analogous to karishyam, namely, pravatsyam, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> find, unless it is meant for Apast. Srauta S. VI, 27, 2, namo vo'stu pravatsyam iti Bahvrikah, where <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> pravatsyam is probably meant for pravatsam.

Grassmann has understood devata rightly, while Roth's translation leaves it doubtful.

Von Roth has adopted the translation of the second line, which I suggested in a note; Ludwig prefers the more abrupt construction which I preferred in the translation. It is difficult to decide.

Von Roth:

'Gefallen find ich, wie sie sind, an ihnen,
   In Raschheit und in Frische unvergleichlich.
 So oft ich euch, Marut, im Schmuck erblickte,
   Erfreut' ich mich und freue jetzt an euch mich.'

This is again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of those verses which it is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> easier to translate than to construe. Akkhanta me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mean, they pleased me, but then what is the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of khadayatha ka nunam, 'may you please me now,' instead of what we should expect, 'you do please me now.' In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to avoid this, I took the more frequent <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of khad, to appear, and translated, 'you have appeared formerly, appear to me now.'

To translate anedyah sravah a' ishah dadhanah, by 'in Raschheit und in Frische unvergleichlich,' is poetical, but how does it benefit the scholar? I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> a dha in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of bringing or giving, as it is often used cf. II, 38, 5. This is more compatible with ishah, food, vigour. I am not <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that anedyah can mean blameless. Roth s. v. derives anedya from a-nedya, and nedya from nid. But how we get from nid to nedya, he does not say. He suggests anedyah or anedyasravah as emendations. I suggested anedyam. But I suspect there is something else behind all this. Anediyah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been intended for 'having <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> coming nearer,' and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an-uttama, <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> express excellence. Or anedyah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been an adverb, not nearly.

[p. xix]

These are mere guesses, and they are rather contradicted by anedyah, used in the plural, with anavadyah. Still it is better to point out difficulties than to slur them over by translating 'in Raschheit und in Frische unvergleichlich.' It is possible that both Roth and Sayana <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that anedyah was connected with nediyah; but what scholars want to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> is the exact construction of a sentence.

Von Roth:

'Wo dankbar huldigend der Dichter lobsingt,

 Da kehret ein, ihr Marut, bei den Frommen,
   Euch gelten ja des Beters heil'ge Spruche.'

Prof. von Roth admits that this is a difficult verse. He translates it, but again he does not help us to construe it. Grassmann <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> gives us a metrical translation, but it differs widely from von Roth's:

'Wenn wie zur Spende euch der Dichter herlockt,
   Und der Gesang des Weisen uns herbeizog,' &c.;

and so does Geldner's version, unless we are to consider this as an improved rendering from von Roth's own pen:

'Wenn uns des Manya Kunst zur Feier herzieht,
   Wie Dichter ja zu Festen gerne rufen,' &c.

Here Geldner conjectures duvasya' for duvasya't, and takes duvase as an infinitive.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 15.

Von Roth:

'Geweiht ist euch der Preis, Marut, die Lieder,

 Mit Labung kommt herbei, mir selbst zur Starkung

[p. xx]

How tanve vaya'm is to mean 'mir selbst zur Starkung' has not been explained by von Roth. No doubt tanve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mean mir selbst, and vayam zur Starkung; but <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> satisfy a poet, scholars want to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> how to construe.

Professor Oldenberg has sent me the following notes on this difficult hymn.

[p. xxiii]

I have often been asked why I began my translation of the Rig-veda with the hymns addressed to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> or the Storm-gods, which are certainly not the most attractive of Vedic hymns. I had several reasons, though, as often happens, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> hardly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> which of them determined my choice.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> of all, they are the most difficult hymns, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they had a peculiar attraction in my eyes.

Secondly; as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> when translated they required a considerable effort before they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be fully understood, I hoped they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prove attractive to serious students only, and frighten <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the casual reader who has done so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> harm by meddling with Vedic antiquities.

Thirdly, there are few hymns which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the original character of the so-called deities to whom they are addressed in so clear a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> as the hymns addressed to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> or Storm-gods. There can be no doubt about the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the name, whatever difference of opinion there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be about its etymology. Marut and maruta in ordinary Sanskrit mean wind, and more particularly a strong wind, differing by its violent character from vayu or vata [*a]. Nor do the hymns themselves leave us in any doubt as to the natural phenomena with which the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> are identified. Storms which root up the trees of the forest, lightning, thunder, and showers of rain, are the background from which the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> in their personal and dramatic character rise before our eyes. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> are the very phenomena of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as convulsed by a thunderstorm; in the next, with the slightest change of expression, they are young men, driving on chariots, hurling the thunderbolt, and crushing the clouds in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to win the rain. Now they are the <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Rudra and Prisni, the friends and brothers of Indra, now they quarrel with Indra and claim their own rightful share of praise and sacrifice. Nay, after a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the storm-gods in India, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the storm-gods in other countries,

[p. xxiv]

obtain a kind of supremacy, and are invoked by themselves, as if there were no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> beside them. In most of the later native dictionaries, in the Medini, Visva, Hemakandra, Amara, and Anekarthadhvanimangari, Marut is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> as a synonym of deva, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> in general [*a], and so is Maru in Pali.

But while the hymns addressed to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> enable us to watch the successive stages in the development of so-called deities more clearly than any other hymns, there is no doubt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> drawback, namely, the uncertainty of the etymology of Marut. The etymology of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is and always <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be the best key to the original intention of a deity. Whatever Zeus became afterwards, he was originally conceived as Dyaus, the bright sky. Whatever changes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> over Ceres in later times, her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> and her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> conception was Sarad, harvest. With regard to Marut I have myself no doubt whatever that Mar-ut comes from the root M, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of grinding, crushing, pounding (Sk. mrinati, himsayam, part. murna, crushed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> mridita; amur and amuri, destroyer). There is no objection to this etymology, either on the ground of phonetic rules, or on <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of Marut [*b]. Professor Kuhn's idea that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> was derived from the root M, to die, and that the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> were originally conceived as the souls of the departed, and afterwards as ghosts, spirits, winds, and lastly as storms, derives no support from the Veda. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> etymology, proposed in Bohtlingk's Dictionary, which derives Marut from a root M, to shine, labours under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> disadvantages; first, that there is no such root in Sanskrit [*c]; secondly, that the lurid splendour of the lightning is but a subordinate feature in the character of the Maruts. No better etymology having been proposed, I still maintain that the derivation of Marut from M, to pound, to smash, is free from any objection, and that the original conception of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> was that of the crushing, smashing, striking, tearing, destroying storms.

This will clear me, I hope, of the very unfair suspicion that, by beginning my translation of the Rig-veda with hymns celebrating the wild forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> only, I had wished to represent the Vedic religion as nature-worship and <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> else.

The MS. of this volume was ready, and the printing of it was actually begun in 1885. A succession of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> calls on my time, which admitted of no refusal, have delayed the actual publication till now.

It is chiefly due to him that the results of the latest attempts at the interpretation of the Veda, which are scattered about in learned articles and monographs, have been utilised for this volume. His suggestions, I need hardly say, have proved most valuable; and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> he should not be held responsible for any mistakes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be discovered, whether in the translation or in the notes, my readers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> at all events <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> it for granted that, where my translation seems unsatisfactory, Professor Oldenberg <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> had <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> better to suggest.

Considering my advancing years, I <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> I should act in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> interest of Vedic scholarship, if for the future <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> I divided my <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> with him. While for this volume the chief responsibility rests with me, the second volume will contain the hymns to Agni, as translated and annotated by him, and revised by me. In places where we really differ, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> so. For the rest, we are willing to share both blame and praise. Our chief object is to help forward a critical study of the Veda, and we are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>

Professor Bollensen (Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 462),

[p. xli]

adopting to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> extent the second rendering of Professor Roth in preference to that of Professor Benfey, endeavoured to show that the 'something else which is neglected,' is not something indefinite, but the worship of all the other gods, except Indra.

Something of the same kind had been attempted by the original collectors of the ten books, for it can hardly be by accident that each of them begins with hymns addressed to Agni, and that these are followed by hymns addressed to Indra. The only exception to this rule is the eighth Mandala, for the ninth being devoted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> deity, to Soma, can hardly be accounted an exception.

As <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as I can judge, they seem to me, in their <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> form, the product of the same period of Vedic scholarship. The Pratisakhyas, it is true, start from the Pada text, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> it, as it were, for granted, and devote their rules to the explanation of those changes which that <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> undergoes in being changed into the Samhita text. But, on the other hand, the Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> in some cases clearly presupposes the Samhita text. It leaves out passages which are repeated more than once, while the Samhita <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> always repeats these passages; it abstains from dividing the termination of the locative plural su, whenever in the Samhita text, i. e. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the rules of Sandhi, it becomes shu; hence nadishu, agishu, but ap-su; and it gives short vowels instead of the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> ones of the Samhita, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in cases where the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> vowels are justified by the rules of the Vedic language. It is certain, in fact, that <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> the Pada nor the Samhita text, as we now possess them, represents the original <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Veda. Both show clear traces of scholastic influences. But if we try to restore the original <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the Vedic hymns, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> certainly arrive at some kind of Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> rather than at a Samhita text; nay, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in their <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> form, the original metre and rhythm of the ancient hymns of the Rishis are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more perceptible when the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are divided, than when we join them <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> throughout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the rules of Sandhi.

In the vast majority of cases the divided text, with a few such rules as we have to observe in reading Latin, nay, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in reading Pali verses, brings us certainly <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> nearer to the original utterance of the ancient Rishis than the amalgamated text.

The critical principles by which I have been guided in editing for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Rig-veda, require a few <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of explanation, as they have lately been challenged on grounds which, I think, rest on a complete misapprehension of my previous statements on this subject.

As <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as we are able to judge at present, we can hardly speak of various readings in the Vedic hymns, in the usual <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of that word. Various readings to be gathered from a collation of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> MSS., now accessible to us, there are none. After collating a considerable number of MSS., I have succeeded, I believe, in fixing on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> representative MSS., as described in the preface to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> volume of my edition of the Rig-veda. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> these MSS. are not free from blunders,--for what MS. is?--but these blunders have no claim to the title of various readings. They are lapsus calami, and no more; and, what is important, they have not <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> traditional [*a].

[p. xliv]

The text, as deduced from the best MSS. of the Samhita text, can be controlled by four independent checks. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is, of course, a collation of the best MSS. of the Samhita text.

The second check to be applied to the Samhita <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is a comparison with the Pada text, of which, again, I possessed at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> excellent MS., and several more modern copies.

The third check was a comparison of this <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> with Sayana's commentary, or rather with the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which is presupposed by that commentary. In the few cases where the Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> seemed to differ from the Samhita text, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> was added to that effect, in the various readings of my edition; and the same was done, at least in all important cases, where Sayana clearly followed a <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> at variance with our own.

The fourth check was a comparison of any doubtful passage with the numerous passages quoted in the Pratisakhya.

These were the principles by which I was guided in the critical restoration of the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Rig-veda, and I believe I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> as printed by me is more correct than any MS. now accessible, more trustworthy than the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> followed by Sayana, and in all important points identically the same with that <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which the authors of the

[p. xlv]

[paragraph continues] Pratisakhya followed in their critical researches in the fifth or sixth century before our era. I believe that starting from that date our <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Veda is better authenticated, and supported by a more perfect apparatus criticus, than the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of any Greek or Latin author, and I do not think that diplomatic criticism can ever go beyond what has been achieved in the constitution of the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Vedic hymns.

Grassmann:

No other MS., as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as I am aware, repeats this blunder. In IX, 86, 34, the writer of the same MS. puts ragasi instead of dhavasi, because his eye was caught by raga in the preceding line. X, 16, 5, the same MS. reads sam gakkhasva instead of gakkhatam, which is supported by S 1, S 2, P 1, while S 3 has a peculiar and more important reading, gakkhatat. X, 67, 6, the same MS. P 2 has vi kakartha instead of vi kakarta.

A number of various readings which have been gleaned from Pandit Taranatha's [p. xliv] Tuladanadipaddhati (see Trubner's American and Oriental Literary Record, July 31, 1868) belong to the same class.

To remove, for instance, the eleven hymns 49-59 in the eighth Mandala from their proper place, or count them by themselves as Valakhilya [*a] hymns, seems to me, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> no doubt perfectly harmless, little short of a critical sacrilege.

Eight [*c] of them are mentioned in the Brihaddevata, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any allusion to their apocryphal character:

After the hymn addressed to <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> (VIII, 60), there follow six hymns addressed to Indra, beginning with ubhayam.'

But the most important point of all is this, that these hymns, which exist both in the Pada and Samhita texts, are quoted by the Pratisakhya, not only for general purposes, but for special passages occurring in them, and nowhere else. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> in Sutra 154, hetayah is quoted as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the few <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> which do not require the elision of a following short a. In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to appreciate what is implied by this special quotation, it is necessary to have a clear insight into the mechanism of the Pratisakhya.

In our passage the author of the Pratisakhya endeavours to comprehend all the passages where an initial a in the Veda is not elided after a final e or o.

Hence the Samhita writes to 'vadan, so'yam, but not sikshanto'vratam, for here the a of avratam is heavy; nor mitramaho'vadyat, for here the a following the v is heavy.

After this, a more general rule is given, or, more correctly, a more comprehensive observation is made, viz. that under all circumstances initial a is elided, if the preceding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ends in aye, ayah, ave, or avah.

Nor should it be supposed that such minute discordances between the two, as the length or shortness of a vowel, were always rendered necessary by the requirements of the metre, and that for that reason the ancient students or the later copyists of the Veda abstained from altering the peculiar spelling of words, which seemed required by the exigencies of the metre in the Samhita text, but not in the Pada text. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in some cases it is not so in all.

We are told that Pragapati created the world, and in the process of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> the following interlude occurs:

The commentator remarks with regard to tapas: natra tapa upavasadirupam, kimtu srashtavyam vastu kidrisam iti paryalokanarupam.

^xlvi:b A similar omission was pointed out by Professor Roth. Verses 21-24 of the 53rd hymn of the third Mandala, which contain imprecations against Vasishtha, are left out by the writer of a Pada MS., and by a copyist of Sayana's commentary, probably because they both belonged to the family of Vasishtha. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> edition of the Rig-veda, vol. ii, p. lvi, Notes.

Vedic Hymns, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Part</span> I (SBE32), by Max Muller, [1891], at sacred-texts.com

I begin with some mistakes of my own, mistakes which I <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have avoided, if I had always consulted the Pratisakhya, where single <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> or <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> passages of the Veda are quoted. Some of these mistakes have been removed by Professor Aufrecht, others, however, appear in his transcript as they appear in my own edition.

I need hardly point out passages where palpable misprints in my edition have been repeated in Professor Aufrecht's text. I mean by palpable misprints, cases where a glance at the Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> or at the Samhita <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> or a reference to Sayana's commentary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> show at once what was intended. Thus, for instance, in VI, 15, 3. vridhe, as I had printed in the Samhita, was clearly a misprint for vridho, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen from the Pada, which gives vridhah, and from Sayana. Here, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> Professor Aufrecht repeats vridhe, I think it hardly necessary to show that the authority of the best MSS.

[p. lvi]

the object of the most learned and painstaking discussions, not to claim too large an indulgence for misprints. A misprint in the Samhita, if repeated in the Pada, or if admitted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the commentary of Sayana, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it need not be <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> down to the editor's deplorable ignorance, becomes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a serious matter, and I willingly <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> all the blame which is justly due for occasional accidents of this character. Such are, for instance, II, 12, 14, sasamanam instead of sasamanam; I, 124, 4, sudhyuvah, in the Pada, instead of sundhyuvah; and the substitution in several places of a short u instead of a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> u in such forms as susavama, when occurring in the Pada; cf. I, 166, 14; 167, 9.

It is clear from the Pratisakhya, Sutra 819 and 163, 5, that the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> uti' indra in IV, 29, I, should not be joined together, but that the hiatus should remain. Hence uti'ndra, as printed in my edition and repeated in Professor Aufrecht's, should be corrected, and the hiatus be preserved, as it is in the fourth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> of the same hymn, uti' ittha'. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right; in S 2 the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are joined.

It follows from Sutra 799 that to double the y in vaiyasva is a mistake, but a mistake which had to be pointed out and guarded against as early as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the Pratisakhya. In VIII, 26, 11, therefore, vaiyyasvasya, as printed in my edition and repeated in Professor Aufrecht's, should be changed to vaiyasvasya. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right, likewise P 1, P 2; but S 2 has the double mistake vayyasvasya, as described in the Pratisakhya; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> MS. of Wilson's has vaiyy. The same applies to VIII, 23, 24, and VIII, 24, 23. P 1 admits the mistaken spelling vayyasva.

Some corrections that ought to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in the Padapatha only, as printed in my edition, are pointed out in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> to Sutra 738 of the Pratisakhya. Thus, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Sutra 583, 6, sruya'h in the Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of II, 10, 2, should be changed to sruya'h. MSS. P 1, P 2 have the short u.

In V, 7, 8, I had printed sukih shma, leaving the a of

[p. lvii]

shma short in accordance with the Pratisakhya, Sutra 514, where a string of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> before which sma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be lengthened, and where under No. 11 we find yasmai. Professor Aufrecht has altered this, and gives the a as long, which is wrong. The MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.

Here Professor Aufrecht has retained the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> a, which is wrong. MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.

It follows from Sutra 499 that in I, 138, 4, we should not lengthen the vowel of su. Hence, instead of asya' u shu' na upa sataye, as printed in my edition and repeated by Professor Aufrecht, we should read asya' u shu na upa sataye. S 1, S 2, S 3 have short u [*a].

In VII, 31, 4, I had by mistake printed viddhi instead of viddhi'. The same reading is adopted by Professor Aufrecht (II, p. 24), but the authority of the Pratisakhya, Sutra 445, can hardly be overruled. S 1, S 2, S 3 have viddhi'.

While in cases <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> these, the Pratisakhya is an authority which, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as I can judge, ought to overrule the authority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> MS., <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> ancient, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> in other cases depend either on the testimony of the best MSS. or be guided, in fixing on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> reading, by Sayana and the rules of grammar.

In V, 9, 4, I had printed by mistake puru yo instead of puru' yo. I had, however, corrected this misprint in my edition of the Pratisakhya, 393, 532. Professor Aufrecht decides in favour of puru with a short u, but against the authority of the MSS., S 1, S 2, S 3, which have puru'.

I, 165, 5. A mere change of accent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> seem a small

Professor Aufrecht alters this into eta'n (p. 153), which, no doubt, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> form, if it were intended for the accusative plural of the pronoun, but not if it is meant, as it is here, for the accusative plural of eta, the speckled deer of the Maruts.

I, 165, 15. yasishta (Aufr. p. 154) instead of yasishta (M. M. vol. ii, p. 298) is not supported by any MS.

I, 169, 7, instead of patayanta (Aufr. p. 158), read patayanta (M. M. vol. ii, p. 322).

I, 174, 7. kuyavakam (Aufr. p. 162) should be kuyavakam (M. M. vol. ii, p. 340).

I, 177, 1. yukta', which I had adopted from MS. S 3 (prima manu), is not supported by other MSS., <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> P 2 reads yuttka'. Professor Aufrecht, who had retained yukta' in the text, has afterwards corrected it to yuktva', and in this he was right. In I, 177, 2, gahi for yahi is wrong.

I, 188, 4. astrinan (Aufr. p. 171) instead of astrinan (M. M. vol. ii, p. 395) can only be a misprint.

II, 29, 6. kartad (Aufr. p. 203) instead of karta'd (M. M. vol. ii, p. 560) is wrong.

II, 40, 4. kakra (Aufr. p. 214) instead of kakra (M. M. vol. ii, p. 614) is wrong.

III, 7, 7. guh (Aufr. p. 226) instead of guh (M. M. vol. ii, p. 666) is wrong; likewise III, 30, 10, gah (Aufr. p. 241) instead of ga'h (M. M. vol. ii, p. 792).

III, 17, 1. igyate (Aufr. p. 232) instead of agyate (M. M. vol. ii, p. 722) is impossible.

III, 47, 1. Professor Aufrecht (p. 256) puts the nominative indro instead of the vocative indra, which I had <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> (vol. ii, p. 902). I doubt whether any MSS. support that change (S 1, S 2, S 3 have indra), but it is clear that Sayana takes indra as a vocative, and likewise the Nirukta.

III, 50, 2. Professor Aufrecht (p. 258) gives asya, both in the Samhita and Pada, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the accent on the last syllable. But all the MSS. that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> (S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1,

M. vol. ii, p. 912), and this no doubt is right. The same mistake occurs again in III, 51, 10, (Aufr. p. 259); IV, 5, 11, (Aufr. p. 281); IV, 36, 2, (Aufr. p. 309); V, 12, 3, (Aufr. p. 337); while in VIII, 103, 9, (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 195) the MSS. consistently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> asya as unaccented, whereas Professor Aufrecht, in this very passage, places the accent on the last syllable. On the same page (p. 259) amandan, in the Pada, is a misprint for amandan.

III, 53, 18. asi (Aufr. p. 262) instead of asi (M. M. vol. ii, p. 934) is wrong, because hi requires that the accent should remain on asi. S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, P 2 have asi.

IV, 4, 7. sva a'yushe (Aufr. p. 279) instead of sva a'yushi (M. M. vol. iii, p. 37) is not supported by any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> MSS., nor required by the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the passage. S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, P 2 have a'yushi.

IV, 5, 7. arupitam, in the Pada, (Aufr. p. 280) instead of a'rupitam (M. M. vol. iii, p. 45) is right, as had been shown in the Pratisakhya, Sutra 179, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> by a misprint the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> a of the Samhita had been <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the short a of the Pada.

IV, 5, 9. read gauh (M. M. vol. iii, p. 46) instead of goh (Aufr. p. 281).

IV, 15, 2. ya'ti, with the accent on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> syllable, is supported by all MSS. against yati (Aufr. p. 287). The same applies to ya'ti in IV, 29, 2, and to varante in IV, 31, 9.

IV, 18, 11. ami, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any accent (Aufr. p. 293), instead of ami' (M. M. vol. iii, p. 105) is wrong, because ami' is <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> unaccented.

IV, 21, 9. no, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> an accent (Aufr. p. 296), instead of no (M. M. vol. iii, p. 120) is wrong.

IV, 26, 3. atithigvam (Aufr. p. 300) instead of atithigvam (M. M. vol. iii, p. 140) and VI, 47, 22, atithigvasya (Aufr. p. 437) instead of atithigvasya (M. M. vol. iii, p. 776) are wrong, <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> atithigva <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> occurs again except with the accent on the last syllable. The MSS. do not vary. Nor do they vary in the accentuation of kutsa: hence kutsam (Aufr. p. 300) should be kutsam (M. M. vol. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">iii</span> p. 139).

[p. xliv]

IV, 36, 6. Professor Aufrecht (p. 309) has altered the accent of a'vishuh into avishuh, but the MSS. are unanimous in favour of a'vishuh (M. M. vol. iii, p. 181).

Again in IV, 41, 9, the MSS. support the accentuation of agman (M. M. vol. iii, p. 200), while Professor Aufrecht (p. 313) has altered it to agman.

IV, 42, 9. adasat, being preceded by hi, ought to have the accent; (Aufrecht, p. 314, has adasat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the accent.) For the same reason, V, 29, 3, avindat (M. M. vol. iii, p. 342) ought not to have been altered to avindat (Aufr. p. 344).

IV, 50, 4. vyoman is a misprint for vyoman.

V, 15, 5. Professor Aufrecht (p. 338) writes dirgham instead of dogham (M. M. vol. iii, p. 314). This, no doubt, was done intentionally, and not by accident, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> from the change of accent. But dogham, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it occurs but once, is supported in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> by all the best MSS., and has been accepted by Professor Roth in his Dictionary.

V, 34, 4. prayato (Aufr. p. 351) instead of prayata (M. M. vol. iii, p. 371) is wrong.

V, 42, 9. visarmanam (Aufr. p. 358) instead of visarma'nam (M. M. vol. iii, p. 402) is wrong.

V, 44, 4. parvane (Aufr. p. 360) instead of pravane (M. M. vol. iii, p. 415) is wrong.

V, 83, 4. vanti (Aufr. p. 389) instead of va'nti (M. M. vol. iii, p. 554) is supported by no MSS.

V, 85, 6. asinkantih (Aufr. p. 391) instead of asinkantih (M. M. vol. iii, p. 560) is not supported either by MSS. or by grammar, as sink belongs to the Tud-class. On the same grounds ishayantah, VI, 16, 27 (M. M. vol. iii, p. 638), ought not to have been changed to ishayantah (Aufr. p. 408), nor VI, 24, 7, avakarsayanti (Ni. M. vol. iii, p. 687) into avakarsayanti (Aufr. p. 418).

VI,. 46, 10, read girvanas (M. M. vol. iii, p. 763) instead of girvanas (Aufr. p. 435).

VI, 60, 10. krinoti (Aufr. p. 450) instead of krinoti (M. M. vol. iii, p. 839) is wrong.

VII, 40, 4. aryama' a'pah (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 35), in the Pada instead of aryama' apah (M. M. vol. iv, p. 81) is wrong.

[p. lxv]

VII, 51, 1. adityana'm (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 40) instead of aditya'nam (M. M. vol. iv, p. 103) is wrong.

VII, 64, 2. ila'm (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 50) instead of ilam (M. M. vol. iv, p. 146) is wrong. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> gopah in the Pada should be changed in my edition to gopa.

VII, 66, 5. yo (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 51) instead of ye (M. M. vol. iv, p. 151) is <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> supported by S 3, but evidently untenable on <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of atipiprati.

VII, 72, 3. In abudhran Professor Aufrecht has properly altered the wrong spelling abudhnan; and, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the authority of the best MSS. is concerned (S 1, S 2, S 3), he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> in putting a final n, although Professor Bollensen prefers the dental n; (Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 599.) The fact is that Vedic MSS. use the Anusvara dot for final nasals before all class-letters, and leave it to us to interpret that dot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the letter which follows. Before I felt quite <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> on this point, I have in several cases retained the dot, as <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by the MSS., instead of changing it, as I ought to have done <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to my system of writing , into the corresponding nasal, provided it represents an original n. In I, 71, 1, S 2, S 3 have the dot in agushran, but S 1 has dental n. In IX, 87, 5, asrigran has the dot; i. e. S 1 has the dot, and nkh, dental n joined to kh; S 2 has nkh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the dot before the n; S 3 has the dot, and then kh. In IV, 24, 6, the spelling of the Samhita avivenam tam <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> leave it doubtful whether we ought to read avivenan tam or avivenam tam; S 1 and S 3 read avivenam tam, but S 2 has avivenan tam; P 2 has avi-venan tam, and P 1 had the same originally, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> a later <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> changed it to avi-venam tam. In IV, 25, 3, on the contrary, S 1 and S 3 write avivenam; S 2, avivenam; P i and P 2, avi-venam. What is intended is clear enough, viz. avi-venan in IV, 24, 6; avi-venam in IV, 25, 3. [In the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> edition avivenam has been left in both passages.]

VII, 73 1. asvina (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 56) instead of asvina (M. M. vol. iv, p. 176) is wrong. On the same page, dhishnye, VII, 72, 3, should have the accent on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> syllable.

VII, 77, 1. In this verse, which has been so often discussed

[p. lxvi]

[paragraph continues] (see Kuhn, Beitrage, vol. iii, p. 472; Bohtlingk and Roth, Dictionary, vol. ii, p. 968; Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 463), all the MSS. which I know, read kara'yai, and not either kara'thai nor gara'yai.

VIII, 2, 29. kirinam (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 84) instead of karinam (M. M. vol. iv, p. 308) does not rest on the authority of any MSS., nor is it supported by Sayana.

VIII, 9, 9. Professor Aufrecht has altered the very important <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> akukyuvimahi (M. M. vol. iv, p. 389) to akukyavimahi (vol. ii, p. 98). The question is whether this was done intentionally and on the authority of any MSS.

VIII, 32, 14. ayantaram (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 129) instead of ayanta'ram (M. M. vol. iv, p. 567) is wrong.

VIII, 47, 15. dushvapnyam (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 151) is not so correct as duhshvapnyam (M. M. vol. iv, p. 660), or, better, dushshvapnyam (Pratisakhya, Sutras 255 and 364), <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is perfectly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the MSS. write dushvapnyam.

[I ought to state that all these errata have been corrected by Professor Aufrecht in his second edition.]

In the ninth and tenth Mandalas I have not to defend myself, and I need not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a list of the passages where I think that Professor Aufrecht's <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> is not supported by the best MSS. My own edition of these Mandalas will soon be published, and I need hardly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that where it differs from Professor Aufrecht's text, I am prepared to show that I had the best authorities on my side.

Professor Aufrecht writes in the second edition of his Romanised <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Rig-veda (p. iv): 'Um den Herren, die diese Druckfehler in majorem gloriam suam mit so grosser Schonung hervorgehoben haben, einen Gegendienst zu erweisen, bemerke ich einige derselben.' Dieser Gegendienst, so gut er gemeint war, ist leider nicht sehr bedeutend ausgefallen, auch nicht immer in majorem gloriam Catonis.

In I, 161, 2, Professor Aufrecht objects to katuras krinotana. I felt doubtful about it, and in the commentary I printed katurah krinotana. In IV, 33, 5, the reading

[p. lxvii]

katus kara is sanctioned by the authority of the Pratisakhya, Sutra 281, 4.

In I, 181, 5, Aufrecht prefers mathra; Sayana, Bohtlingk and Roth, and I prefer mathna.

In II, II, 10, he has discovered that gurvit was meant for gurvat. Whitney still quotes gurvit.

In III, 9, 4, he has discovered that apsu should be 'psu; but this had been already corrected.

In VIII, 55, 5, for na read a. The MSS. vary in both cases.

In IX, 108, 7, in vanakraksha, the kra was printed as ri. Professor Aufrecht <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have seen it correctly printed in the index. Sayana read vanariksha.

In X, 28, 11, Professor Aufrecht thinks that the Pada should have godhah instead of godha. I think godha is right, in spite of Professor Aufrecht's appeal to the silence of the Pratisakhya. The fact is that godhah <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> occurs, while godha occurs in the preceding verse, and again VIII, 69, 9.

It has been supposed that in the index at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of my fourth volume, the seventeenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> of the 34th hymn in the seventh Mandala has been wrongly assigned to Ahi Budhnya, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> half only of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> should have been reserved for that deity.

As Sayana does not speak authoritatively on the subject, I followed the authority of Shadgurusishya. This commentator of the Anukramanika says: atra ka abgam ukthair ahim grinisha ity ardharko'bganamno [*a] devasya stutih; ma no'hir budhnya ity ardharko'hirbudhnyanamno devasya [*b]. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> commentator says: abgam ukthair ardharko'hih; uttaro ma no'hir ity ahir budhnyah. From this we learn that both commentators looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Dvipadas as ardharkas or half-verses, and ascribed the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 16 to Ahir abgah, the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 17 to Ahir budhnyah. It will be seen from an accurate examination of Sayana's commentary on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 17, that in the second interpretation of the second half of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 17, he labours to show that in this portion, too, Ahir budhnyah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be considered as the deity.

It is perfectly <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Anukramanika, abgam aheh, signify that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> beginning with abgam, belongs to Ahi. But there was no misprint in my index. It will be seen that Shadgurusishya goes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> beyond me, and calls that deity simply Abga, leaving out Ahi altogether, as understood. I was anxious to show the distinction between Abga Ahih and Ahir Budhnyah, as the deities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> successive verses, and I did not expect that any reader <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> possibly misinterpret my entry [*c].

With regard to hymns 91 and 92 of the seventh Mandala, it is true, that in the index I did not mention that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> verses in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> deities are mentioned (91, 2;

[p. lxix]

[paragraph continues] 4-7; 92, 2), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be considered as addressed not to Vayu alone, but to Vayu and Indra. It will be seen from Sayana's introduction to hymn 90, that he, too, wrongly limits the sentence of the Anukramanika, aindryas ka ya dvivaduktah, to the fifth and following verses of hymn 90, and that he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> alludes to this proviso again in his introductory remarks to hymn 91 and 92, though, of course, he explains the verses, in which a dual occurs, as addressed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> deities, viz. Indra and Vayu. The same omission, whether intentional or unintentional, occurs in Shadgurusishya's commentary. The other commentary, however, assigns the verses of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hymns rightly. The subject has evidently been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> that excited attention in very early days, for in the Aitareya-brahmana, V, 20, we actually find that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> vam which occurs in hymn 90, 1, and which <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be taken as a dual, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> Sayana explains it as a singular, is changed into te [*a].

In hymn VII, 104, rakshohanau <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> certainly be added as an epithet of Indra-Somau, and Shadgurusishya clearly takes it in that sense. The Anukramanika says: indrasoma pankadhikaindrasomam rakshoghnam sapabhisapaprayam.

In hymn VIII, 67, it has been supposed that the readings Samada and Samada instead of Sammada and Sammada were due to a misprint. This is not the case. That I was aware of the other spelling of this name, viz. Sammada and Sammada, I had shown in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (2nd ed.), p. 39, where I had translated the passage of the Sankhayana-sutras in which Matsya Sammada occurs, and had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> attention to the Asvalayana-sutras X, 7, and the Satapatha-brahmana XIII, 3, 1, 1,

[p. lxx]

where the same passage is found. I there spelt the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Sammada, because the majority of the MSS. were in favour of that spelling. In the edition of the Asvalayana-sutras, which has <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> been published by Rama Narayana Vidyaranya, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is spelt Samada. My own opinion is that Sammada is the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> spelling, but that does not prove that Sayana <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> so; and unless I deviated from the principles which I had adopted for a critical restoration of Sayana's text, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not but write Samada in our passage. B 1 and B 4 omit samada, but both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> samadakhyasya; Ca. gives likewise samadakhyasya, and A. semadakhyasya. This, I believe, was meant by the writer for sammadakhyasya, for in the passage from the Anukramani both A. and Ca. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> sammado. I then consulted the commentary of Shadgurusishya, and there again the same MS. gave twice sammada, once samada, which is explained by samadakhyamahaminaragaputrah. A better MS. of Shadgurusishya, MS. Wilson 379 gives the readings sammado, sammada, and sammadakhyasya. The other commentary gives distinctly samanda. [I have adopted sammada in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> edition.]

In IX, 68, Professor Aufrecht adopts what he considers the bold reading Vatsapri; I prefer to be timid and allow Sayana his own reading Vatsapri; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Sarvanukramani, ed.

[p. lxxi]

Verses 21-30 of the same hymn are ascribed by Professor Aufrecht to the Prisniyah. Here, again, several MSS. support that reading; and in Shadgurusishya's commentary, the correction of prisniyah into prisnayah is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by a later hand. But Sayana clearly took prisnayah for a nominative plural of prisni, and in this <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> he certainly was right. The Dictionary of Bohtlingk and Roth quotes the Mahabharata, VII, 8728, in support of the peculiar reading of prisniyah, but the published <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> gives prisnayah. Professor Benfey, in his list of poets (Ind. Stud. vol. iii, p. 223), gives prisniyoga as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> word, not prisniyoga, as stated in the Dictionary of Bohtlingk and Roth, but this is evidently meant for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> words, viz. prisnayo'gah. However, whether prisniyah or prisnayah be the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of these poets, an editor of Sayana is bound to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> that reading of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> which Sayana believed to be the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> one, i. e. prisnayah [*a].

Again, in the same hymn, Professor Aufrecht ascribes verses 31-40 to the Atris. We should then have to read tritiye'trayah. But Sayana read tritiye trayah, and ascribes verses 31-40 to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> companies <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> of the Rishis mentioned before. On this point the MSS. admit of no doubt, for we read: katurthasya ka dasarkasya akrishta masha ityadidvinamanas trayo gana drashtarah. I do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the other explanation is wrong; I only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that, whether <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> or wrong, Sayana certainly read trayah, not atrayah; and an editor of Sayana has no more <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to correct the text, supported by the best MSS., in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and second, than in the third of these passages, all taken from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same hymn.

But <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> I insist so strongly on a strict observance of the rules of diplomatic criticism with regard to the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Rig-veda, nay, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of Sayana, I insist equally strongly on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> of independent criticism, which ought to begin where diplomatic

All scholars who have touched on this verse, Professors Benfey, Bollensen, Roth, and others, have pointed out that

instead of ka ratham, the original poet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> karatham. The phrase sthatuh karatham, what stands and moves, occurs several times. It is evidently an ancient phrase, and hence we can <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for the preservation in it of the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> termination of the nom. sing. of neuters in ri, which here, as in the Greek mar-tyr or mar-tys, masc., appears as ur or us, while in the ordinary Sanskrit we find ri only. This nom. sing. neut. in us, explains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the common genitives and ablatives, pituh, matuh, &c., which stand for pitur-s, matur-s.

What stands and what moves is afraid of Agni.

I, 68, 1. sthatuh karatham aktu'n vi urnot.

I, 72, 6. pasu'n ka sthatri'n karatham ka pahi.

Here it has been proposed to read sthatuh instead of sthatri'n, and I confess that this emendation is very plausible. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how pasu, cattle, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> immobilia or fixtures, unless the poet wished to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a distinction between cattle that are kept fastened in stables, and cattle that are allowed to roam about freely in the homestead.

But although I have no doubt that in I, 70, 4, the original poet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> sthatuh karatham, I should be loath to suppress the evidence of the mistake and alter the Pada <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> from ka ratham to karatham. The very mistake is instructive, as showing us the kind of misapprehension to which the collectors of the Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> were liable, and enabling us to judge how <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> the limits of conjectural criticism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> safely be extended.

A still more extraordinary <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of misunderstanding on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the original compilers of the Vedic texts, and likewise of the authors of the Pratisakhyas, the Niruktas, and other Vedic treatises, has been pointed out by Professor Kuhn. In an article of his, 'Zur altesten Geschichte der Indogermanischen Volker' (Indische Studien, vol. i, p. 351), he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the following observation: 'The Lithuanian laukas, Lett. lauks, Pruss. laukas, all <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> field, agree exactly with the Sk. lokas, world, Lat. locus, Low Germ. (in East-Frisia and Oldenburg) louch, loch, village. All these <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are to be traced back to the Sk. uru, Gr. eyrus, broad, wide. The initial u is lost, as in Goth. rums, O. H. G. rumi, rumin (Low Germ. rume, an open uncultivated field in a forest), and the r changed into l. In support of this derivation it should be observed that in the Veda loka is frequently preceded by the particle u, which probably was only separated from it by the Diaskeuastae, and that the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is

It should be remembered that in the Gathas the u of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> beginning with urv degrees does not count metrically (Hubschmann, Ein Zoroastrisches Lied, p. 37), and that in Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> uru <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be treated as monosyllabic, in such passages as Mahav., p. 2, line 5.

But this was done by the poets themselves, or, at all events, it was not done by the authors of the Pratisakhya. They simply register such changes, but they do not enjoin them, and in this we, too, should follow their example. It is, therefore, a point of some importance in the critical restoration and proper pronunciation of Vedic texts, that in the rules which we have to follow in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to satisfy the demands of the metre, we should carefully distinguish between what is sanctioned by ancient authority, and what is the result of our own observations. This I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> now proceed to do.

First, then, the authors of the Pratisakhya distinctly admit

[p. lxxx]

that, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to uphold the rules they have themselves laid down, <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> syllables are to be pronounced as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> syllables. We read in Sutra 527: 'In a deficient pada the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> number is to be provided for by protraction of semivowels (which were originally vowels), and of contracted vowels (which were originally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> independent vowels).' It is only by this process that the short syllable which has been lengthened in the Samhita, viz. the sixth, or the eighth, or the tenth, can be shown to have occupied and to occupy that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where alone, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to a former rule, a short syllable is liable to be lengthened. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we read:

This, however, is against the system of the Pratisakhya.

It ought to have been given, for it is only by observing such a rule that in I, 61, 12, gor na parva vi rada tiraska, we get a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> of eleven syllables, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> secure for da in rada the eighth place, where alone the short a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be lengthened. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> we look in vain for a rule sanctioning the change of semivowels into vowels, except where the semivowels can rightly be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> kshaipra-varna (Sutra 974), i. e. semivowels that were originally vowels.

Having this authority in our favour, I do not think that we use too <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> liberty if we extend this modified pronunciation, recognised in so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> cases by the ancient scholars of India themselves, to other cases where it seems to us required as well, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to satisfy the metrical rules of the Veda.

Secondly, I believe it can be proved that, if not the authors of the Pratisakhya, those at least who constituted the Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> which was current in the ancient schools and which we now have before us, were fully aware that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> vowels and diphthongs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be used as short. The authors of the Pratisakhya remark that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> changes which can <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> before a short syllable only, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> likewise before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> no, although the vowel of this 'no' is by them supposed to be long. After having stated in Sutra 523 that the eighth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable

[p. lxxxiii]

follows, they remark that for this purpose nah or no is treated as a short syllable:

X, 59, 4. dyu-bhih hitah garima su nah astu, (Samh. su no astu.)

Again, in stating that the tenth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable follows, the same exception is understood to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in favour of nah or no, as a short syllable:

VII, 48, 4. nu devasah varivah kartana nah, (Samh. kartana no, bhuta no, &c.)

With regard to e being shortened before a short a where, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to rule, the a should be elided, we actually find that the Samhita gives a instead of e in RV.

I do not ascribe very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> weight to the authority which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> derive from these observations with regard to our own treatment of the diphthongs e and o as either <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or short in the Veda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in answer to those who are incredulous as to the fact that the vowels e and o <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> ever be short in Sanskrit, an appeal to the authority of those who constituted our text, and in constituting it clearly treated o as a short vowel, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> weight.

Pratisakhya 136 [*c]. Hence brahma rishih becomes brahma rishih or brahmarshih; kumari risyah becomes kumari risyah or kumary risyah. This rule enables us to explain a number of passages in which the Samhita <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> either changes the final <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> vowel into a semivowel, or leaves it unchanged, when the vowel is a pragrihya vowel. To the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> class belong such passages as I, 163, 12; IV, 38, 10, vagi' arva, Samh. vagyarva; VI, 7, 3, vagi' agne, Samh. vagyagne; VI, 20, 13, pakthi' arkaih, Samh. pakthyarkaih; IV, 22, 4, sushmi' a' goh, Samh. sushmya' goh. In these passages i is the termination of a nom. masc. of a stem ending in in.

In these passages the i is the termination of feminines. In X, 15, 4, uti' arva'k, Samh. utyarva'k, the final i of the instrumental uti ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, for, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> not followed by iti, it is to be treated as pragrihya; (Pratis. 163, 5.)

mentioned as an exception in Sutra 174, 9. The same applies to II, 3, 4, vedi iti asya'm, Samh. vedyasya'm. The pragrihya i ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, but the fact that it had been changed irregularly, was again duly registered in Sutra 174, 5. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pragrihya i therefore, which have really to be pronounced short, were irregularly changed in the Samhita into the semivowel; and as this semivowel, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all semivowels, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> vyavaya, the same object was attained as if it had been written by a short vowel. With regard to pragrihya u, no such indication is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by the Samhita text; but in such passages as I, 46, 13, sambhu iti sam-bhu a' gatam, Samh. sambhu a' gatam; V, 43, 4, bahu' iti adrim, Samh. bahu' adrim, the pragrihya u of the dual can be used as short, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the u of madhu atra, <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> as an example by the commentators of Panini.

To Professor Kuhn, I believe, belongs the merit of having extended this rule to final a. That the a of the dual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> short, was mentioned in the Pratisakhya, Sutra 309, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in none of the passages there mentioned is there any metrical necessity for this shortening (see <page lii>). This being the case, it is impossible to deny that where this a is followed by a vowel, and where Sandhi between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vowels is impossible, the final a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be treated as short.

I agree with Professor Kuhn when he scans:

There is no reason for shortening a in

Still less can we quote nari-bhyah as an instance of a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> i being shortened, for nari-bhyah is derived from narih, not from nari, and occurs with a short i <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> when the metre requires a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> syllable; I, 43, 6. nri-bhyah nari-bhyah gave. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda the forms narishu and nari-bhyah <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> occur, but always narishu, nari-bhyah; while from vasi we <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> find any forms with short i, but always va'sishu, va'si-bhih.

Nor is there any justification for change in I, 25, 16. gavah na gavyutih anu, the second pada of a Gayatri. Nor in V, 56, 3. rikshah na vah marutah simi-van amah. In most of the passages mentioned by Professor Kuhn on p. 122, this peculiarity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be observed, that the eighth syllable is short, or, at all events, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be short, when the ninth is long:

VI, 44, 21. vrishne te induh vrishabha  pipaya.

VII, 13, 1. bhare havih na barhishi  iprinanah.

II, 28, 7. enah krinvantam asura  bhrinanti.

Before, however, we can settle the question whether in

[p. lxxxix]

these and other places <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> vowels should be pronounced as either <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or short, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> settle the more general question, what authority we have for requiring a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or a short syllable in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> places of the Vedic metres.

^lxxxi:a It will be seen from my edition of the Pratisakhya, particularly from the extracts from Uvata, <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> after Sutra 974, that the idea of making <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> syllables out of goh, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> entered Uvata's mind. M. Regnier was right, Professor Kuhn (Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 187) was wrong.

If we carefully follow the thread which runs through these books, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> soon perceive that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> with the proviso that a short syllable follows, the Pratisakhya <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> teaches that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> final vowels <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be lengthened. The object of the Pratisakhya, as I pointed out on a former occasion, is to register all the facts which possess a phonetic interest. In doing this, all kinds of plans are adopted in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> as large a number of cases as possible under general categories. These categories are purely technical and external, and they <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> assume, with the authors of the Pratisakhya, the character of general rules. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us now, after these preliminary remarks, return to the Sutras 523 to 535, which we discussed before. The Pratisakhya simply <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> syllables which are short in the

As instances the commentator gives (Samhita text):

I, 32, 4. tadi'tna satrum na kila  vivitse.

I, 94, 1. agne sakhye ma' rishama vayam tava.

While in some cases they have ears to hear and to appreciate the natural flow of the poetical language of the Rishis, they seem at other times as deaf as the adder to the voice of the charmer.

A general rule, therefore, in our <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the word, that the eighth syllable in hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, the tenth syllable in hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, and the sixth syllable in octosyllabics should be lengthened, rests in no <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> on the authority of ancient grammarians. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> as a mere observation, they restrict it by the condition that the next syllable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be short, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to provoke the lengthening of the preceding syllable, thereby sanctioning, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> exceptions; and they then proceed to quote a number of cases where, in spite of all, the short syllable remains short [*a]. In some of these quotations they are no doubt wrong, but in most of them their statement <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be disputed.

As to the eighth syllable being short in hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, they quote such verses as,

VI, 66, 4. antar (iti) santah avadyani punanah.

As to the tenth syllable being short in a dodecabyllabic, they quote

II, 27, 14. adite mitra varuna uta mrila.

As to the tenth syllable being short in a hendecasyllabic, they quote

II, 20, 1. vayam te vayah indra viddhi su nah.

As to the sixth syllable being short in an octosyllabic, they quote

VIII, 23, 26. mahah visvan abhi satah.

A large number of similar exceptions are collected from

however, the final pada, too, in Anushtubha metre is allowed greater freedom, and the rule, as above given, is strictly maintained with regard to the Traishtubha and Gagata padas only.

This subject is so important, and affects so large a number of passages in the Veda, that it requires the most careful examination. The Vedic metres, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sight very perplexing, are very simple, if reduced to their primary elements. The authors of the Pratisakhyas have elaborated a most complicated system. Counting the syllables in the most mechanical manner, they have assigned nearly a hundred names to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> variety which they discovered in the hymns of the Rig-veda [*a]. But they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> observed that the constituent elements of all these metres were really but four, (Sutras 988, 989):

1. The Gayatra pada, of eight syllables, ending in    .

2. The Vairaga pada, of ten syllables, ending in    .

3. The Traishtubha pada, of eleven syllables, ending in    .

4. The Gagata pada, of twelve syllables, ending in    .

Then follows an important rule, Sutra 990: 'The penultimate syllable,' he says, in a Gayatra and Gagata pada is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> (laghu), in a Vairaga and Traishtubha pada heavy (guru).' This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> their vritta.

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> vritta, which is generally translated by metre, had evidently originally a more special meaning. It meant the final rhythm, or if we <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> it literally, the  turn of a line, for it is derived from vrit, to turn. Hence vritta is the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> as the Latin versus, verse; but I do not wish to decide whether the connection between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> is historical, or simply etymological. In Latin, versus is always supposed to have meant originally a furrow, then a line, then a verse. In Sanskrit the metaphor that led to the formation of vritta, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of final rhythm, has <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> to do with ploughing. If, as I have tried to prove (Chips from a German Workshop,

[p. xcvi]

vol. i, p. 84), the names assigned to metres and metrical language were derived from <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> originally referring to choregic movements, vritta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have meant the turn, i. e. the last step of any <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> movement; and this turn, as determining the general character of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> movement, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> naturally be regulated by more severe rules, while greater freedom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be allowed for the rest.

Having touched on this subject, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> fact in support of my view.

I believe they should be derived from a root stubh, which is preserved in Greek, not only in styfelos, hard, styfelizu, to strike hard, but in the root stemf, from which stemfylon, stamped or pressed olives or grapes, and astemfes, untrodden (grapes), then unshaken; and in stembu, to shake, to ram, stobeu, to scold, &c. In Sanskrit this root is mentioned in the Dhatupatha X, 34, shtubhu stambhe, and it exists in a parallel <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> as stambh, lit. to stamp down, then to fix, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> firm, with which Bopp has compared the German stampfen, to stamp; (Glossarium, s. v. stambh.)

I explain Anushtubh, which consists of four equal padas, each of eight syllables, as the 'After-step,' because each line was stamped regularly after the other, possibly by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> choruses, each side taking its turn. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> passage in the Veda where Anushtubh seems to have preserved this meaning:

X, 124, 9. anu-stubham anu karkuryamanam indram ni kikyuh kavayah manisha'.

Poets by their wisdom discovered Indra dancing to an Anushtubh.

In V, 52, 12, khandah-stubhah kubhanyavah utsam a'

[p. xcvii]

kirinah nrituh, in measured steps (i. e. stepping the metre) and wildly shouting the gleemen have danced toward the spring.

Other names of metres which point to a similar origin, i. e. to their original connection with dances, are Pada-pankti, 'Step-row;' Nyanku-sarini, 'Roe-step;' Abhisarini, 'Contre-danse,' &c.

If now we return to the statement of the Pratisakhya in reference to the vrittas, we should observe how careful its author is in his language. He does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the penultimate is <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or short, but he simply states, that, from a metrical point of view, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be considered as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> or heavy, which need not mean more than that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be pronounced with or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> stress. The fact that the author of the Pratisakhya uses these terms, laghu and guru, instead of hrasva, short, and dirgha, long, shows in fact that he was aware that the penultimate in these padas is not invariably <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or short, though, from a metrical point of view, it is always heavy or light.

It is perfectly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that if we keep to these four padas, (to which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> more pada, viz. the half Vairaga, consisting of five syllables, <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be added) we can reduce nearly all the hymns of the Rig-veda to their simple elements which the ancient poets combined together, in general in a very simple way, but occasionally with greater freedom. The most important strophes, formed out of these padas, are,

1. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Gayatra padas = the Gayatri, (24 syllables.)

I am not <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> whether Professor Bollensen, who has touched on this metre in an article just published (Zeitschrift der D. M.

He has clearly seen that the division of the lines, as <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the MSS. of the Samhita text, is wrong; but he seems inclined to admit the same rhythm throughout, and to treat the strophe as consisting of four lines of five syllables each, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of six syllables, which last line is to submit to the prevailing rhythm of the preceding lines. If we differ, however, as to the internal architecture of this strophe, we agree in condemning the interpretation proposed by the Pratisakhya; and I should, in connection with this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to call attention to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> important facts: first, that the Samhita text, in not changing, for instance, the final t of martat, betrays itself as clearly later than the elaboration of the ancient theory of metres, later than the invention of such a metre as the Padapankti; and secondly, that the accentuation, too, of the Samhita is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> proved to be posterior to the establishment of these fanciful metrical divisions, and hence <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> throughout claim so irrefragable an authority as certainly belongs to it in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> cases.

But although with regard to the Gayatra, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add, the Anushtubha padas, the evidence as to the variety of their vrittas is such that it can hardly be resisted, a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more determined stand has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in defence of the vritta of the Traishtubha and Gagata padas. Here Professor Kuhn and those who follow him maintain that the rule is absolute, that the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> in      , the latter in        , and that the eighth syllable, immediately preceding these syllables, ought, if possible, to be long. Nor can I deny that Professor Kuhn has <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forward powerful arguments in support of his theory, and that his emendations of the Vedic <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> recommend themselves by their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ingenuity and simplicity. If his theory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be carried out, I should readily admit that we should gain something. We should have throughout the Veda a perfectly uniform metre, and wherever we <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> any violation of it, we should be justified in resorting to conjectural criticism.

The only question is at what price this strict uniformity can be obtained. If, for instance, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to have the regular vrittas at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of Traishtubha and Gagata lines, we were obliged to repeal all rules of prosody, to allow almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> short vowel to be used as long, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> vowel to be used as short, whether <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> or by position, we should have gained very little, we

[p. cvii]

should have robbed Peter to pay Paul, we should have removed no difficulty, but only ignored the causes which created it. Now, if we examine the process by which Professor Kuhn establishes the regularity of the vrittas or final syllables of Traishtubha and Gagata padas, we find, in addition to the rules laid down before, and in which he is supported, as we saw, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent by the Pratisakhya and Panini, viz. the anceps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of e and o, and of a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> final vowel before a vowel, the following exceptions or metrical licences, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which that metrical uniformity at which he aims, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be obtained:

II, 39, 3. prati vastor usra (see Trisht.  section 5).

Here the o of vastoh is supposed to be short, although it is the Guna of u, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from the final e of sarve or aste, or the final o of sarvo for sarvas or mano for manas [*a]. It should be remarked that in Greek, too, the final diphthongs corresponding to the e of sarve and aste are treated as short, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the accent is concerned. Hence apoikoi, tuptetai, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> gnumai, nom. plur. In Latin, too, the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> terminations of the nom. sing. o and u, instead of the later us, are short. (Neue, Formenlehre,  section 23 seq.)

VI, 51, 15. gopa ama.

Here the o of gopa is treated as short, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to get         instead of        , which is perfectly legitimate at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of an Ushnih.

2. The <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> i and u are treated as short, not only before vowels, which is legitimate, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> before consonants.

If, in explanation of this shortening of vitam, vihi is quoted, which is identified with vihi, this can hardly be considered as an argument, for vihi occurs where no short syllable is required, IV, 48, 1; II, 26, 2; and where, therefore, the shortening of the vowel <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be attributed to metrical reasons.

We now proceed to consider a number of prosodial rules which Professor Kuhn proposes to repeal in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to have a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> syllable where the MSS. supply a short:

1. The vowel ri is to be pronounced as long, or rather as ar. Ex. I, 12, 9. tasmai pavaka mrilaya is to be read mardaya; V, 33, 10. samvaranasya risheh is to be read arsheh. But why not samvaranasy  ri*sheh (i. e. siarsheh)?

2. The a privativum <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be lengthened. Ex. agarah, amritah.

3. Short vowels before liquids <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be long. Ex. narah, taruta, tarati, marutam, harivah, arushi, dadhur iha, suvita (p. 471).

4. Short vowels before nasals <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be lengthened. Ex. ganan, sanitar, tanuh, upa nah.

7. The group ava is to be pronounced aua. Ex. avase becomes auase; savita becomes sauita; nava becomes naua.

8. The group aya is to be changed into aia or ea. Ex. nayasi becomes naiasi.

9. The group va is to be changed into ua, and this ua to be treated as a kind of diphthong and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> long. Ex. kanvatamah becomes kanua*tamah; varunah becomes ua*runah.

10. The short vowel in the reduplicated syllable of perfects is to be lengthened. Ex. tatanah, dadhire.

11. Short vowels before all aspirates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be lengthened. Ex. rathah becomes rathah; sakha becomes sakha.

15. The short vowel before p <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be lengthened. Ex. apam becomes apam; tapushim becomes tapushim ; grihapatim becomes grihapatim.

Selbstverstandlich kann kurz o und e im Veda erst recht nicht zugelassen werden.' Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 574.

^cviii:b Here a distinction should be made, I think, between an n before a consonant, and a final n following a short vowel, which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the rules of Sandhi, is doubled, if a vowel follows.

Preserving the same classification which I adopted before for the Gayatris, so as to include the important eighth syllable of the Trishtubh, which does not properly belong to the vritta, I maintain that class 4.        , class 5.        , and class 8.         <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be recognised as  endings in the hymns of the Veda, and that by recognising them we are relieved from nearly all, if not all, the more violent prosodial licences which Professor Kuhn felt himself obliged to admit in his theory of Vedic metres.

The verses which fall under  section 4 are so numerous that after those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Mandala, mentioned above, they need not be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> here in full. They are simply cases where the eighth syllable is not lengthened, and they <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be supposed to run counter to any rule of the Pratisakhya, for the simple reason that the Pratisakhya <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> gave such a rule as that the eighth syllable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be lengthened, if the ninth is short. Examples will be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in the final pada of Trishtubhs: II, 30, 6; III, 36, 4; 53, 15; 54, 12; IV, 1, 16; 2, 7; 9; 11; 4, 12; 6, 1; 2; 4; 7, 7; 11, 5; 17, 3; 23, 6; 24, 2; 27, 1; 28, 5; 55, 5; 57, 2; V, 1, 2; VI, 17, 10; 21, 8; 23, 7; 25, 5; 29, 6; 33, 1; 62, 1; 63, 7; VII, 21, 5; 28, 3; 42, 4; 56, 15; 60, 10; 84, 2; 92, 4; VIII, 1, 33; 96, 9; IX, 92, 5; X, 61, 12; 13; 74, 3; 117, 7.

'Cum patribus populoque, penatibusque et magnis dis,'

But before we draw any general conclusions from such instances, we should consider whether they do not admit of a grammatical instead of a metrical explanation. The nominative singular of the demonstrative pronoun was sa before it was sas; by the side of bhu'mih we have a secondary <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> bhu'mi; and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> conclude from svadhiti-van, I, 88, 2, that the Vedic poets knew of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> svadhiti, by the side of svadhitih.

Professor Bollensen's remark, that Vedic verses <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be treated to all the licences of Latin scanning [*d], is hardly a sufficient answer; and he himself, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> under a slightly <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> form, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> admit as much, if not more, than has been admitted on this point by Professors Kuhn and Roth.

The reason is clear. To us the conception of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> God, which pervades the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of this hymn, seems later than the conception of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> gods, as recognised in various aspects of nature, such as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the sky, the sun, the storms, or the fire. And in a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be right, and language <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> confirms our sentiment.

itself is an apax legomenon. Sam avartata is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> only in the last Mandala, X, 90, 14; 129, 4. Bhuta also, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of what is, occurs in the tenth Mandala only. It is used <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times (X, 55, 2; 58, 12; 90, 2) as opposed to bhavya, i. e. what is and what will be; and once more in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of all that is (X, 85, 17). Atmada'h, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of giving life, is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> apax legomenon. Prasish is restricted to Mandalas I (I, 145, 1), IX (IX, 66, 6; 86, 32), and our passage. Himavat, apax legomenon. The repetition of the relative pronoun in verses 2 and 4 is unusual. In the tenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> the compound yat-kamah is modern, and the insertion of eta'ni between tvat and anyah is at all events exceptional. The passage V, 31, 2 is not parallel, because in tvat indra vasyah anyat, the ablative tvat is governed by vasyah. In VI, 21, 10, na tva'van anyah amrita tvat asti, anyah is separated from tvat by a vocative only, as in VIII, 24, 11.

But when we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> hymn is modern, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> carefully consider what we mean.

The following passages will illustrate the principal <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of arusha, and justify the translation here adopted.

  

ARUSHa, AS AN ADJECTIVE.

Arusha is used as an adjective in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of red:

VII, 97, 6. tam sagma'sah arusha'sah asvah brihaspatim saha-va'hah vahanti,--nabhah ni rupam arusham vasanah.

III, 29, 6; IV, 58, 7; I, 114, 5; V, 59, 5; 12, 2; 12, 6; VI, 8, 1.

VI, 48, 6. syava'su arushah vrisha.

X, 1, 6; VI, 3, 6.

X, 20, 9. krishnah svetah arushah ya'mah asya bradhnah rigrah uta sonah.

His (Agni's) path is black, white, red, bright, reddish, and yellow.

Here it is extremely difficult to keep all the colours distinct.

Arusha is frequently applied to Soma, particularly in the 9th Mandala. There we read:

IX, 8, 6. arushah harih. IX, 71, 7. arushah divah kavih vrisha. IX, 74, 1. va'gi' arushah. IX, 82, 1. arushah vrisha harih. IX, 89, 3. harim arusham.

In IX, 72, 1, arusha seems used as a substantive in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of red-horse.

[p. 19]

Professor Spiegel, in his important review of my translation (Heidelberger Jahrbucher, 1870, p. 104), points out that aurusha in Zend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> white, so that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem as if the original <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of arusha had been bright, bright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> fire, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> red.

  

ARUSHa, AS AN APPELLATIVE.

Arusha is used as an appellative, and in the following senses:

1. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> red-horse of the Sun, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or more red-horses of Agni.

Here ushasah, the dawns, occur in the same line, so that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> arushih either as an adjective, referring to the dawns, or as a substantive, as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the dawn or of her cows.

Here, too, the vocative arushi is probably to be taken as an adjective, particularly if we consider the next following verse:

IV, 52, 2. asva-iva kitra' arushi mata' gavam rita-vari sakha abhut asvinoh usha'h.

The dawn, beautiful and red, like-a mare, the mother of the cows (days), the never-failing, she became the friend of the Asvins.

X, 5, 5. sapta svasrih arushih.

The seven red sisters.

THE FEMININE ARUSHi, AS A SUBSTANTIVE.

If used as a substantive, arushi seems to mean the dawn. It is likewise used as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the horses of Agni, Indra, and Soma; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for mare in general.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> dawn in X, 8, 3, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> points here so clearly to the dawn, and the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of dawn is mentioned so immediately after, that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> passage seems hardly sufficient to establish the use of arushi as a recognised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the dawn. Other passages, however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> likewise gain in perspicuity, if we took arushi by itself as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the dawn, just as we had to admit in several passages arusha by itself as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the morning. Cf. I, 71, 1.

Arushi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the horses of Agni, in I, 14, 12:

yukshva hi arushih rathe haritah deva rohitah.

Yoke, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> (Agni), the red-horses to the chariot, the bays, the ruddy.

I, 72, 10. pra ni'kih agne arushih aganan.

They knew the red-horses, Agni, coming down. VIII, 69, 5.

Soma, as we saw, was frequently spoken of as arushah harih.

In IX, 111, 2, tridha'tubhih arushibhih seems to refer to the same red-horses of Soma, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> this is not quite clear.

The passages where arushi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> simply a mare, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any reference to colour, are VIII, 68, 18, and VIII, 55, 3.

It is curious that Arusha, which in the Veda <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> red, should, as pointed out before, in its Zend <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> aurusha, mean white. That in the Veda it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> red, and not white, is shown, for instance, by X, 20, 9, where sveta, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for white, is mentioned by the side of arusha. Most likely arusha meant originally brilliant, and became fixed with <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> shades of brilliancy in Sanskrit and Persian. Arusha presupposes a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> ar-vas, and is derived from a root ar in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of running or rushing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> Chips from a German Workshop, vol. ii, pp. 135, 137.

Having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> explained the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> meanings of arusha and arushi in the Rig-veda, I feel it incumbent, at least for once, to explain the reasons why I differ from the classification of Vedic passages as <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the Dictionary published by Boehtlingk and Roth. Here, too, the passages in which arusha is used as an adjective are very properly separated from those in which it appears as a substantive. To begin with the first, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that 'arusha <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> ruddy, the colour of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> and his horses; he (Agni) himself appears as a red-horse.' In support of this, the following passages are quoted:

III, 1, 4. avardhayan su-bhagam sapta yahvi'h svetam gagnanam arusham mahi-tva', sisum na, gatam abhi aruh asvah. Here, however, it is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> was born brilliant-white [*a], and grew red, that the horses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to him as they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to a new-born foal. <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> himself is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a red-horse.

III, 7, 5. Here, again, vrishnah arushasya is no doubt meant for Agni. But vrishan by itself does not mean horse, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is added to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> names of horses to qualify them as male horses; cf.

In III, 31, 3, agnih gagne guhva regamanah maha'h putra'n arushasya pra-yakshe, I do not venture to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> who is meant by the mahah putra'n arushasya, whether Adityas or Maruts, but hardly the <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Agni, as <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> himself is mentioned as only born. But, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if it were so, the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of these <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> (putra) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> hardly be intended here for a horse.

ruddy, and the arusha'sah vrishanah, the red stallions, are distinctly mentioned. Here vrishan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be translated by stallion, instead of simply by male, because arusha is here a substantive, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of a horse.

V, 1, 5. ganishta hi genyah agre ahnam hitah hiteshu arushah vaneshu. Here arushah is simply an adjective, red, referring to Agni, who is understood throughout the hymn to be the object of praise. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be kind to those who are kind to him, and to be red in the woods, i. e. brilliant in the wood which he consumes; cf.

In V, 12, 2 and 6, VI, 48, 6, we have again simply arusha vrishan, which does not mean the red-horse, but the red male, the red hero, i. e. Agni.

In VI, 49, 2, divah sisum sahasah sunum agnim yagnasya ketum arusham yagadhyai, there is no trace of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> being conceived as a horse. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the child of the sky or of Dyu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of strength (who is produced by strong rubbing of wood), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> or the beacon of the sacrifice, and lastly Arusha, which, for reasons stated above, I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> to be used here as a name.

Next follow the passages in which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Professor Roth, arusha, as an adjective, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be applied to the horses, cows, and other teams of the gods, particularly of the dawn, the Asvins, and Brihaspati.

I, 118, 5. pari vam asvah vapushah patanga'h vayah vahantu arusha'h abhi'ke. Here we find the vayah arusha'h of the Asvins, which it is better to translate by red birds, as immediately before the winged horses are mentioned. In fact, whenever arusha is applied to the vehicle of the Asvins, it is to be understood of these red birds, IV, 43, 6.

In I, 92, 1 and 2 (not 20), arushi occurs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, referring twice to the cows of the dawn, once to the dawn herself.

In IV, 15, 6, tam arvantam na sanasim arusham na divah sisum marmrigyante dive-dive, arusha does not refer to the horse or any other animal of Agni. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> speaks of a horse by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of comparison only, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that the sacrificers clean or trim Agni, the fire, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> clean a horse.

But dha'man in the Rig-veda does not mean flames, and it seems better to translate, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> red companies, scil. the Maruts.

That arusha in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> passages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the red cloud, is true. But in X, 43, 9, arusha refers to the thunderbolt mentioned in the same verse; and in I, 114, 5, everything refers to Rudra, and not to a red cloud,, in the proper <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the word.

Further on, where the meanings attributable to arushi in the Veda are collected, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that arushi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> a red mare, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the teams of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> and Ushas.

(See Chips from a German Workshop, vol. iv, p. 508.)

In Sanskrit svadha' clearly shows the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of one's own nature, power, disposition. It does not mean <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in general, but always the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of some one, the peculiarity, the individuality of a person. This will appear from the following passages:

II, 3, 8. tisrah devi'k svadhaya barhih a' idam akkhidram pantu.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> goddesses protect by their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> the sacred pile unbroken.

IV, 13, 5. kaya yati svadhaya.

IV, 26, 4. akakraya svadhaya.

The same expression occurs again X, 27, 19.

[p. 34]

In some places the verb mad, to delight, joined with svadhaya, seems to mean to revel in his strength, to be proud of his might.

V, 32, 4. svadhaya madantam.

Vritra who delights in his strength.

VII, 47, 3. svadhaya madantih.

The waters who delight in their strength. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> X, 124, 8.

In other passages, however, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> see, the same phrase (and this is rather unusual) requires to be taken in a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> sense, so as to mean to rejoice in food.

I, 164, 38; III, 17, 5.

III, 35, 10. indra piba svadhaya kit sutasya agneh va pahi gihvaya yagatra.

Indra drink of the libation by thyself (by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> own power), or with the tongue of Agni, O worshipful.

To drink with the tongue of <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> is a bold but not unusual expression. V, 51, 2. agneh pibata gihvaya. X, 15, 3.

I, 165, 6. kva' sya' vah marutah svadha' asit yat ma'm ekam sam-adhatta ahi-hatye.

Where was that custom of yours, O Maruts, when you left me alone in the killing of Ahi?

VII, 8, 3. kaya nah agne vi vasah su-vriktim ka'm um (iti) svadha'm rinavah sasyamanah.

IV, 58, 4; IV, 45, 6.

I, 64, 4. sakam gagnire svadhaya.

They (the Maruts) were born together, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their nature; very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> anu svadha'm, I, 6, 4. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> can hardly render it here by 'they were born by their own strength,' or 'by spontaneous generation.'

In other passages, however, svadhaya, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> originally by its own power, or nature, comes to mean, by itself, sponte sua.

VII, 78, 4. a' asthat ratham svadhaya yugyamanam.

She, the dawn, mounted the chariot which was harnessed by itself, by its own power, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> requiring the assistance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> the horses to.

[p. 35]

X, 129, 2. a'nit avatam svadhaya tat ekam.

In the same <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> svadha'bhih is used in several passages: I, 113, 13. amrita karati svadha'bhih.

The immortal Dawn moves along by her own strength, i. e. by herself.

VIII, 10, 6. yat va svadha'bhih adhi-tishthathah ratham.

Or whether ye mount your chariot by your own strength, ye Asvins.

I, 164, 30. givah mritasya karati svadha'bhih amartyah martyena sa-yonih.

The living moves by the powers of the dead, the immortal is the brother of the mortal. III, 26, 8; V, 60, 4.

There are doubtful passages, such as I, 180, 6, in which the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of svadha'bhih, too, is doubtful. In VI, 2, 8, svadha' looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an adverb, instead of svadhaya, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then refer to parigma. The same applies to VIII, 32, 6.

But svadha' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> food, lit. one's own portion, the sacrificial offering due to each god, and lastly, food in general.

I, 108, 12. yat indragni (iti) ut-ita su'ryasya madhye divah svadhaya madayethe (iti).

Whether you, Indra and Agni, delight in your food at the rising of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> or at midday.

X, 15, 12. tvam agne ilitah gata-vedah avat havya'ni surabhi'ni kritvi', pra adah pitri-bhyah svadhaya te akshan addhi tvam deva pra-yata havi'mshi. 13. ye ka iha pitarah ye ka na iha ya'n ka vidma ya'n um (iti) ka na pra-vidma, tvam vettha yati te gata-vedah svadha'bhih yagnam sukritam gushasva. 14. ye agni-dagdha'h ye anagni-dagdhah madhye divah svadhaya madayante, tebhih sva-ra't asunitim eta'm yatha-vasam tanva'm kalpayasva.

Professor Roth proposes to render makha in these passages by 'attestation of joy, celebration, praise,' and he takes davane as a dative of davan, a nomen actionis, meaning, the giving.

However, there is a still more complicated division alluded to in IV, 53, 5:

Here we have the sky thrice, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> welkins, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lights, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> heavens, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> earths.

A careful consideration of all these passages will show, I think, that in our passage we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> divah va rokana't adhi in its usual sense, and that we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> separate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> words.

In the next verse, on the contrary, it seems equally clear that divah and pa'rthivat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be separated. At all events there is no passage in the Rig-veda where pa'rthiva is joined as an adjective with dyu. Pa'rthiva as an adjective is frequently joined with ragas, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> with dyu. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> I, 81,

ASHTAKA I, ADHYAYA 3, VARGA 12-14.

  

TO THE <span class="t20 hoverable">MARUTS</span> (THE STORM-GODS).

1. Sing forth, O Kanvas, to the sportive host of your Maruts, brilliant on their chariots, and unscathed [*1],--

2. They who were born together, self-luminous, with the spotted deer (the clouds) [*1], the spears, the daggers, the glittering ornaments [*2].

3. I hear their [*1] whips, almost close by, when they crack them in their hands; they gain splendour [*2] on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> [*3].

5. Celebrate the bull <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the cows (the storm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the clouds) [*1], for it is the sportive host of the Maruts; he grew as he tasted the rain [*2].

6. Who, O ye men, is the strongest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> you here, ye shakers of <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and earth, when you shake them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the hem of a garment [*1]?

10. And these sons, the singers [*1], stretched out the fences in their racings [*2]; the cows had to walk knee-deep.

[p. 64]

11. They <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> this <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and broad unceasing rain [*1] to fall on their ways.

The root ar, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of hurting, is distantly connected with the root mar: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p. 323.

In the Veda ar has the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of offending or injuring, particularly if preceded by upa.

X, 164, 3. yat a-sasa nih-sasa abhi-sasa upa-arima ga'gratah yat svapantah, agnih visvani apa duh-krita'ni agushtani are asmat dadhatu.

Roth translates upara by Verfehlung, missing. Ari, enemy, too, is best derived from this root, and not from ra, to give, with the negative particle, as if <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> originally, as Sayana supposes, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who does not give.

In I, 116, 16, anarvan seems to be used as an adverb; in I, 51, 12, as applied to sloka, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have the more general <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of irresistible, powerful.

I do not think, therefore, that arvat, horse, admits in the nom. and acc. sing. of any forms but arva and arvantam [*a]. Panini (VI, 4, 127) allows the forms arvan and arvanam, but in anarvan only, which, as we saw, has <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> in common with arvat, horse. Benfey: 'die rascheste (keinen Renner habend, uneinholbar),' the quickest (having no racer, hence not to be reached). M. Bergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 188) tries to defend anarvan in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of anasva, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> considering the grammatical objections. In VI, 66, 7 (not I, 6, 7) anasvah does not refer to yamah.

The spears and daggers of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> are meant for the thunderbolts, and the glittering ornaments for the lightning.

From other passages, however, it becomes clear that va'si is a weapon of the Maruts; and Sayana, too, explains it sometimes in that sense: cf.

As. 1884, p. 239), des fils ont, dans leur marche, allonge leurs chants comme des chemins, pour y marcher a genoux (sur les genoux) en mugissant (en chantant).' I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> content myself with shortly pointing out the misgivings which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Vedic scholar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> feel at once in proposing such a rendering. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> as to the conception itself. Can a poet say, 'The <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> have stretched out their songs in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to march on them on their knees?' 'The roads,' as M. Bergaigne shows himself, are only a simile, and no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> walks on a simile. Secondly, the idea that these <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> widened the roads on which they march, is common enough, but that they lengthened their songs, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> paths, is <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> by the Vedic Rishis, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> they in such a <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> have left out the particle na or iva.

I do not think, therefore, that M. Bergaigne's infallible method helps us <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> beyond where we were before. Conjectures are easy, but for that very reason, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> them forward. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> propose to read sunavah divah, a very common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the Maruts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> go a step further, identify

But all this leaves us in utter uncertainty, and where a scholar feels the ground so uncertain beneath his feet, he hesitates to speak with papal authority. M. Bergaigne's strong point is that abhignu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> on their knees, not up to their knees. Here again, I ask, does abhi in prepositional compounds ever mean on? If abhignu is used in the same <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which we use 'on our knees,' it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in Sanskrit mean only 'bowing up to the knees.' Now in I, 72, 5, abhignu seems to express a positive expression of reverence. With regard to the other passages where abhignu occurs, M. Bergaigne has not shown how they ought to be translated so as to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a clear sense. I do not pretend to solve the difficulties, but I think it is better to confess our difficulties than to hide them under the veil of a so-called systematic interpretation. Abhignu, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> mitagnu, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have expressed a position of the knees, expressive of strength, but on such points very little information is to be gained from Indian commentators.

The last sentence expresses the result of this race, viz. the falling of so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> rain that the cows had to walk up to their knees in water. This becomes still clearer from the next verse.

SaYANA: These, the producers of speech, have spread <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> in their courses, they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> the cows to walk up to their knees hi <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to drink the water.

Kadha-priyah is taken in the Padapatha as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> word, and Sayana explains it by delighted by or delighting in praise, a nominative plural. A similar compound, kadhapriya, occurs in I, 30, 20, and there too the vocative sing. fem., kadhapriye, is explained by Sayana as fond of praise. In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to obtain this meaning, kadha has to be identified with katha, story, which is simply impossible. There is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> compound, adha-priya, nom. dual, which occurs VIII, 8, 4, and which Sayana explains either as delighted here below, or as a corruption of kadha-priya.

In Boehtlingk and Roth's Dictionary, kadha-priya and kadha-pri are both taken as compounds of kadha, an interrogative adverb, and priya or pri, to <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> or delight, and they are explained as <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> kind or loving to whom? In the same manner adha-priya is explained as kind then and there.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be confessed, however, that a compound <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> kadha-pri, kind to whom?, is somewhat strange, and it seems preferable to separate the words, and to write kadha priya and adha priya.

It should be observed that the compounds kadha-pri and kadha-priya occur always in sentences where there is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> interrogative pronoun.

In the same manner we ought to translate I, 30, 20:

Who and where was there a mortal to be loved by thee, O beloved, immortal Dawn?

In VIII, 7, 31, where the same <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are repeated as in our passage, it is likewise better to write:

kat ha nunam kadha priyah yat indram agahatana, kah vah sakhi-tve ohate.

What then now? Where is there a friend, now that you have forsaken Indra? Who watches for your friendship?

Why in VIII, 8, 4, adha priya should have been joined into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is more difficult to say, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> here, too, the compound <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> easily be separated.

Kadha does not occur again, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be formed in analogy with adha. It occurs in Zend as kadha.

this explanation, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> ingenious, and, as I am told, particularly truthful in an eastern climate, is somewhat too artificial. If we changed the accent, avatam, unchecked, unconquered, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be better than avata'm, windless. But avata, unconquered, does not occur in the Rig-veda, except as applied to persons. It occurs most frequently in the phrase vanvan avatah, which Sayana explains <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> by himsan ahimsitah, hurting, but not hurt: (VI, 16, 20; 18, 1; IX, 89, 7.) In IX, 96, 8, we read prit-su vanvan avatah, in battles attacking, but not attacked, which renders the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of avata perfectly clear. In VI, 64, 5, where it is applied to Ushas, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be translated by unconquerable, intact.

There are several passages, however, where avata occurs with the accent on the last syllable, and where it is accordingly explained as a Bahuvrihi, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> either windless or motionless, from vata, wind, or from vata, going. (I, 62, 10). In some of these passages we can hardly doubt that the accent ought to be changed, and that we ought to read avata. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> in VI, 64, 4, avate is clearly a vocative applied to Ushas, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> avata, unconquerable, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> immediately following.

1. For the manly host, the joyful, the wise, for the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> thou, O Nodhas [*1], a pure offering [*2].

Prof. Roth, in the Melanges Asiatiques, vii, p. 612, calls the derivation, which he himself discovered, a 'Columbus-Egg.' He derives suvrikti from su + rikti, and translates it by excellent praise. He supports the insertion of v, by the analogy of su-v-ita, for su-ita. This derivation is certainly very ingenious, but there are some difficulties which have still to be accounted for. That the substantive rikti does not occur by itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be fatal, because other <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> in the Veda occur as uttarapadas only. But there is the compound namovrikti in X, 131, 2, which shows that vrikti existed as a substantive, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the Vagasaneyins (X, 32) read namaukti instead. Taitt. S. I, 8, 21; Taitt. Br. II, 6, 1, 3; and Ath. V. XX, 125, 2, have all namovrikti.

In VII, 93, 8, Indra, Vishnu, and the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> together. Nay, ma'ruta, belonging ta the Maruts, becomes actually an epithet of Vishnu, V, 46, 2. ma'ruta uta vishno (iti); and in I, 156, 4. ma'rutasya vedhasah has been pointed out by Roth as an appellation of Vishnu. The mention of Vishnu in our hymn is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> exceptional, but the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> purport of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> is nevertheless very doubtful, chiefly owing to the fact that several of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> occurring in it lend themselves to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> interpretations.

The translations of Wilson, Benfey, and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> have not rendered the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> which the poet intends to describe at all clear. Wilson says: 'May they for whom Vishnu defends (the sacrifice), that bestows all desires and confers delight, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> (quickly) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> birds, and sit down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the pleasant and sacred grass.' Benfey: 'Wenn Vishnu schutzt den rauschtriefenden tropfenden (Soma), sitzen wie Vogel sie auf der geliebten Streu.' Langlois: 'Quand Vichnou vient prendre sa <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> de nos enivrantes libations, eux, comme des oiseaux, arrivent aussi sur le cousa qui leur est cher.' Ludwig: 'Als Vishnu half dem zum rauschtrank eilenden stiere, setzten sie sich wie vogel aufs liebe barhis.'

Whence all these varieties? First, because a'vat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mean, he defended or protected, but likewise, it is supposed, he descried, became aware. Secondly, because vrishan is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most vague and hence most difficult <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> in the Veda, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mean Indra, Soma, or the cloud: (see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> on Vrishan, p. 138.) Thirdly, because the adjective belonging to vrishan, which generally helps us to determine which vrishan is meant, is here itself of doubtful import, and certainly applicable to Indra as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as to Soma and the Asvins, possibly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the cloud.

When applied to the gods, the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of madakyut is by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> certain. It <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> mean rushing about fiercely, reeling with delight, this delight being produced by the Soma, but it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> mean sending down delight, i. e. rain or Soma. The root kyu is particularly applicable to the sending down of rain; cf. Taitt. Samh. II, 4, 9, 2; 10, 3; III, 3, 4, 1; and Indra and his horses, to whom this epithet is chiefly applied, are frequently asked to send down rain. However, madakyut is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> applied to real horses (I, 126, 4) where givers of rain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an inappropriate epithet. I should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> translate madakyut, when applied to Indra, to his horses, to the Asvins, or to horses in general by furiously or wildly moving about, as if 'made or madena kyavate,' he moves in a state of delight, or in a state of intoxication, such as was not incompatible with the character of the ancient gods. Here again the difficulty of rendering Vedic <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> perform their <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> achievements.

Most frequently madakyut is applied to Soma, X, 30, 9; IX, 32, 1; 53, 4; 79, 2; 108, 11; where particularly the last passage deserves attention, in which Soma is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> madakyutam sahasra-dharam vrishabham.

In all these passages we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> translate mada-kyut by bringing delight, showering down delight.

vrisha yutha'-iva vamsagah.

As the strong bull scares the herds.

The same applies to vara'ha, which, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> by itself <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> boar, is determined again by vrishan:

X, 67, 7. vrisha-bhih vara'haih.

With strong boars.

In III, 2, 11, we read:

vrisha--na'nadat na simhah.

Here the males are no doubt the horses or stallions of Agni.

If used by itself, vrishan most frequently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> man, and chiefly in his sexual character. Thus:

In all the passages which we have hitherto examined vrishan clearly retained its etymological meaning, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> then it was not always possible to translate it by mal e.

The same <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> has been retained in other languages in which this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> can be traced. Thus, in Zend, arshan (the later gushan) is used to express the sex of animals in such expressions as aspahe arshno, gen. a male horse; varazahe arshno, gen. a male boar; geus arshno, gen. a male ox; but likewise in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or hero, as arsha husrava, the hero Husrava.

There can be no doubt, in fact, that already in the hymns of the Veda, vrishan had dwindled <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> to a mere epitheton ornans, and that in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to understand it correctly, we must, as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> as possible, forget its etymological

V. Varshishtha, strongest, best, oldest.

It is curious to watch the last stage of the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of vrishan in the comparative and superlative varshiyas and varshishtha. In the Veda, varshishtha still <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> excellent, but in later Sanskrit it is considered as the superlative of vriddha, old, so that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> vrishan, from <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> originally manly, vigorous, young, assuming in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of old. (M. M., Sanskrit Grammar,  section 252.)

I, 32, 7. vrishnah vadhrih prati-ma'nam bubhushan purutra' vritrah asayat vi-astah.

Vritra, the eunuch, trying to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Indra), was lying, broken to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> pieces.

The next passages show vrishan as applied to Agni:

III, 27, 15. vrishanam tva vayam vrishan vrishanah sam idhimahi.

O, strong one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us the strong ones kindle thee, the strong!

The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> company of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> vrisha ganah, the strong or manly host, i. e. the host of the Maruts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any further qualification.

VI. Vrishan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of various deities.

Here lies, indeed, the chief difficulty which is raised by the common use of vrishan in the Veda, that when it occurs by itself, it often remains doubtful who is meant by it, Indra, or Soma, or the Maruts, or some other deity. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> examine a few of these passages, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> some where vrishan refers to Indra:

IV, 30, 10. apa usha'h anasah sarat sam-pishtat aha bibhyushi, ni yat sim sisnathat vrisha.

Ushas <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from her broken chariot, fearing lest the hero should do her violence.

Here vrishan is clearly meant for Indra, who, as we learn from the preceding verse, was trying to conquer Ushas, as Apollo did Daphne; and it should be observed that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> itself, by which Indra is here designated, is particularly appropriate to the circumstances.

I, 103, 6. bhu'ri-karmane vrishabha'ya vrishne satya-sushmaya sunavama somam, yah a-dritya paripanthi'-iva su'rah ayagvanah vi-bhagan eti vedah.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us pour out the Soma for the strong bull, the performer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> exploits, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> strength is true, the hero who, watching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a footpad, comes to us dividing the wealth of the infidel.

Here it is clear again from the context that Indra only can be meant.

But in other passages this is more doubtful:

III, 61, 7. ritasya budhne ushasam ishanyan vrisha mahi' (iti) rodasi (iti) a' vivesa.

The hero in the depth of the heaven, yearning for the dawns, has entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sky and the earth.

[p. 146]

The hero who yearns for the dawns, is generally Indra; here, however, considering that <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> is mentioned in the preceding verse, it is more likely that this god, as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of the morning, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been meant by the poet. That Agni, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> vrishan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any other epithet to show that he is meant rather than any other god, is clear from such passages as,

VI, 3, 7. vrisha rukshah oshadhishu nunot.

He the wild hero shouted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the plants.

In VII, 60, 9, vrishanau, the dual, is meant for Mitra and Varuna; in the next verse, vrishanah, the plural, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> mean the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and their companions.

That Soma is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> simply vrishan, not only in the ninth Mandala, but elsewhere, too, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> from such passages as,

Indra drink of the male (the strong Soma), bruised by the males (the heavy stones), inspirited by whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> makest the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> fall down, inspirited by whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t5 t8 t11 t21 hoverable">hast</span> opened the stables.

Here Sayana, too, sees rightly that 'the male bruised by the males' is the Soma-plant, which, in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to yield the intoxicating juice, has to be bruised by stones, which stones are again likened to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> males. But unless the words, enclosed in brackets, had stood in the text, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> which clearly point to Soma, I doubt whether Sayana <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have so readily admitted the definite <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of vrishan as Soma.

VIII, 96, 14. ishyami vah vrishanah yudhyata agau.

I wish for you, heroes (Maruts), fight in the race!

In all the passages which we have hitherto examined, vrishan was always applied to living beings, whether animals, men, or gods. But as, in Greek, arsen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> at last simply strong, and is applied, for instance, to the

[p. 149]

crash of the sea, ktupos arsen pontoy, so in the Veda vrishan is applied to the roaring of the storms and similar objects.

V, 87, 5. svanah vrisha.

Should kitra here refer to treasures, and vrishan to cattle?

X, 89, 9. ni amitreshu vadham indra tumram vrishan vrishanam arusham sisihi.

Whet, O hero, the heavy strong red weapon against the enemies.

The <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> a in vrishanam is certainly startling, but it occurs once more, IX, 34, 3, where there can be no doubt that it is the accusative of vrishan. Professor Roth takes vrishan here in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of bull (s. v. tumra), but he does not translate the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> passage.

The fact is that whenever upastuta has the accent on the last syllable, it is intended as a proper name, while, if used as a participle, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of praised, it has the accent on the first.

[p. 153]

VIII, 5, 25. yatha kit kanvam a'vatam priya-medham upa-stutam.

Vrishan occurs once more as a proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in VI, 16, 14 and 15:

Here the context can leave no doubt that Dadhyak and Vrishan were both intended as proper names. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> as early as the composition of the Satapatha-brahmana, this was entirely misunderstood.

Br. VI, 3, 3, 4). On this Mahidhara, in his remarks on Vag. Samh. XI, 34, improves still further.

He then takes vrishan as mind, and translates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the heart.

TO THE <span class="t20 hoverable">MARUTS</span> (THE STORM-GODS).

1. Endowed with exceeding vigour and power, the singers, the <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> flinching, the immovable, the impetuous, the most beloved and most manly, have decked themselves with their glittering ornaments, a few only [*1], <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the heavens with the stars,

3. At their racings the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> shakes, as if broken [*1], when on the (heavenly) paths they harness (their deer) for victory [*2]. They the sportive, the roaring, with bright spears, the shakers (of the clouds) have themselves glorified their greatness.

4. That youthful company (of the Maruts), with their spotted horses [*1], moves by itself; hence [*2] it exercises lordship, invested with powers. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> true, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> searchest out sin [*3], <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> blemish. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the manly host will help this prayer.

5. We speak after the kind of our <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> father, our tongue goes <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> at the sight [*1] of the Soma: when the singers (the Maruts) had joined Indra in deed [*2], then only they took their <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> names;--

6. These Maruts, armed with beautiful rings, obtained splendours for their glory [*1], they obtained [*2] rays, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to celebrate them; nay, armed with daggers, speeding along, and fearless, they <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the beloved domain of the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> [*3].

a neuter medha, but such a neuter does nowhere exist in the Veda. We only find the masculine medha, sacrifice, which is out of the question here, on <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of its accent. Hence the passage III, 58, 2, urdhva'h bhavanti pitara-iva medhah, is of no assistance, unless we alter the accent. The feminine medha' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> will, thought, prayer: I, 18, 6; II, 34, 7; IV, 33, 10; V, 27, 4; 42, 13; VII, 104, 6; VIII, 6, 10; 52, 9; IX, 9, 9; 26, 3; 32, 6; 65, 16; 107, 25; X, 91, 8. The construction does not allow us to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> medha' as a Vedic instrumental instead of medhaya, nor does such a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> occur anywhere else in the Rig-veda. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> remains, I believe, but to have recourse to conjecture, and the addition of a single Visarga in the Pada <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remove all difficulty.

NOTES.

A critical examination of Professor von Roth's remarks on this hymn, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with some supplementary notes of my own, will be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in the Preface to this volume.

Very frequently the Asvins are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip. This whip seems originally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the whip of the Maruts, to have been intended for the cracking noise of the storm, preceding the rain.

asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip, i. e. to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> rain:

O Asvins, sprinkle us with your rain-giving whip.

O Asvins, sprinkle the sacrifice with it (your whip).

As an adjective, mimikshu is applied to Indra (III, 50, 3), and mimiksha to Soma (VI, 34, 4).

Iyarti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to rise and to raise. It is particularly applied to prayers raised by the poet in honour of the gods, and the similes used in connection with this, show clearly what the action implied by iyarti really is. For instance,

I, 116, 1. stoman iyarmi abhriya-iva va'tah.

I stir up hymns as the wind stirs the clouds.

X, 116, 9. su-vakasya'm iyarmi sindhau-iva pra irayam na'vam arkaih.

and that after calling <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> their followers, and adorning themselves for battle, they proceed to harness their chariots. Cf. I, 107, 2.

Etan, in all MSS. which I consulted, has here the accent on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> syllable, and Professor Aufrecht ought not to have altered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> into eta'n. If the accent had not been preserved by the tradition of the schools, the later interpreters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> certainly have taken etan for the demonstrative pronoun. As it is, in spite of accent and termination, Sayana in I, 166, 10, seems to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> etah for ete. In other passages, however, Sayana, too, has perceived the difference, and in I, 169, 6, he explains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> very fully as prishadvarna gantaro va asva va. In this passage the Etas are clearly the deer of the Maruts, the Prishatis:

I, 169, 6. adha yat esham prithu-budhna'sah etah.

In the next verse, however, eta seems applied to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> themselves:

I, 169, 7. prati ghora'nam etanam aya'sam marutam srinve a-yata'm upabdih.

The sound of the terrible, speckled, indefatigable <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> is heard, as they approach; unless we translate:

The noise of the terrible deer of the indefatigable <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> is heard, as they approach.

In I, 166, 10, amseshu etah, I adopt Professor Roth's conjecture, that etah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the skins of the fallow deer, so that we should have to translate: On their shoulders are the deer-skins.

In the other passages where eta occurs it is used as a simile only, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> throws no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> on the relation of the Etas to the Maruts. In both passages, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> (V, 54, 5; X, 77, 2), the simile refers to the Maruts, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> to their speed only, and not to their colour.

By asking, Where was that custom that I should be with you and you with me in battle? he implies that it was not always their custom, and that he can dispense with their succour now. He wants to be alone, as in his former battle with Ahi, and does not wish that they should join him (cf. I, 33, 4). Professor Roth takes sam-adhatta in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of implicating, but it can hardly be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> ever implicated Indra in his fight against Ahi.

Other difficulties, however, remain. Duvasya't is taken by Sayana as an ablative of duvasya, worthy of duvas, i. e. of worship, of sacrifice. Unfortunately this duvasya does not occur again, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be formed quite regularly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> namasya', worthy of worship, from namas, worship.

The root from which duvas is derived, is lost in Sanskrit, but it exists in other languages. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have been du or du in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of acting, or sedulously working.

NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the reputed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Mitravarunau, and brother of Vasishtha. The metre in verses 1-13 is Gagati, in 14, 15 Trishtubh. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.

Rabhasa, an adjective of rabhas, and this again from the root rabh, to rush <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a thing, a-rabh, to begin a thing. From this root rabh we have the Latin robur, in the general <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of strength, while in rabies the original <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of impetuous motion has been more clearly preserved. The Greek labros, too, as pointed out by Cowell, comes from this root. In the Vedic Sanskrit, derivatives from the root rabh convey the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> both of quickness and of strength. Quickness in ancient languages frequently implies strength, and strength implies quickness, as we see, for instance, from the German snel, which, from <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> originally strong, comes to mean in modern German quick, and quick only. The German bald again, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> soon, comes from the Gothic balths, the English bold. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we read:

VI, 30. krivirdati vikartanadanti). Professor Roth, in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> to this passage, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that krivi can <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> have the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of well, which is ascribed to it in the Nighantu III, 23, but seems rather to mean an animal, perhaps the wild boar, kapros, with metathesis of v and r. He translates our passage: 'Where

[p. 222]

your lightning with boar-teeth tears.' In his Dictionary, however, he only says, 'krivis, perhaps the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of an animal, and dant, tooth.' Sayana contents himself with explaining krivirdati by vikshepanasiladanti, having teeth that scatter about.

My own translation is founded on the supposition that krivis, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> portion of krivirdati, has <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> to do with krivi, but is a dialectic variety of kravis, raw flesh, the Greek kreas, Latin caro, cruor. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> what is raw, bloody, or gory. From it the adjective krura, horrible, cruentus (Curtius, Grundzuge, p. 142; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 235). A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the goddess Durga in later Sanskrit is kruradanti, and with a similar conception the lightning, I believe, is here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> krivirdati, with gory teeth.

It should be observed that in radati the simile of the teeth of the lightning is carried on. For radati <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be supposed to have had in the Veda, too, the original <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of radere and rodere, to scratch, to gnaw. Rada and radana in the later Sanskrit mean tooth. It is curious, however, that there is no other passage in the Rig-veda where rad clearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to bite. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to cut, in

I, 61, 12. goh na parva vi rada tiraska'.

Cut his joint through, as the joint of an ox.

But in most passages where rad occurs in the Veda, it has the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of giving. It is not the same which we have in the Zend rad, to give, and which Justi rightly identifies with the root radh. But rad, to divide, may, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the German theilen in zutheilen, have taken the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of giving. Greek daiu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to divide, but yields dais, portion, meal, just as Sanskrit day, to divide, yields dayas, share, i. e. inheritance.

This <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is evident in the following passages:

VII, 79, 4. ta'vat ushah ra'dhah asmabhyam rasva ya'vat stotri-bhyah aradah grinana'.

If then we consider that sudhita, as applied to weapons, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> held or <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> aimed, we can hardly doubt that barhana is here, as Sayana says, some kind of weapon.

In other passages Professor Roth is no doubt <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> when he assigns to barhana an adverbial meaning, but I do not think that this <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be appropriate in our verse.

Immediately after, however, it is said, that some authorities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> the dress should be dyed red (kashayam apy eke), the very expression which occurred in Apastamba, and that, in that case, the red for the Brahmana's dress should be taken from the bark of trees (varksha). Manu, who here, as elsewhere, simply paraphrases the ancient Sutras, says, II, 41:

After this we can hardly hesitate how to translate the next verse:

Aditi, however, for the very reason that she was originally intended for the Infinite, for something beyond the visible world, was liable to be identified with a number of finite deities which <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> all be represented as resting on Aditi, as participating in Aditi, as being Aditi. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we read:

Aditi in her Moral Character.

Besides the cosmical character of Aditi, which we have hitherto examined, this goddess has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> assumed a very prominent moral character.

Why this should be so, we can still understand if we watch the transition which led from a purely cosmical to a moral conception of Aditi. Sin in the Veda is frequently conceived as a bond or a chain from which the repentant sinner wishes to be freed:

VII, 86, 5. ava drugdha'ni pitrya sriga nah ava ya' vayam kakrima tanu'bhih, ava ragan pasu-tripam na tayum sriga vatsam na da'mnah vasishtham.

Aditi having once been conceived as granting this adititva, soon assumed a very definite moral character, and hence the following invocations:

In the Atharva-veda Aditi appears more unintelligible, more completely mythological, than in the Rig-veda. We read, for instance, Atharva-veda VII, 6, 1:

'Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the welkin, Aditi is mother, is father, is son; all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> are Aditi, and the five clans of men; Aditi is what was, Aditi is what will be.

In the Taittiriya-aranyaka and similar <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> the mythological confusion becomes greater still. <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">Much</span> valuable material for an analytical study of Aditi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in B. and R.'s Dictionary, and in several of Dr. Muir's excellent contributions to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Vedic theogony and mythology.

It can hardly be joined, as Professor Roth proposes, with sardhaya marutam, owing to the intervening sure brihate.

In several passages aditi, as an epithet, refers to Agni:

IV, 1, 20 (final). visvesham aditih yagniyanam visvesham atithih ma'nushanam.

He, Agni, the Aditi, or the freest, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all the gods; he the guest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all men.

This explanation seems surrendered by B. R. in the second edition of their Dictionary, and I doubt whether samsah can mean here anything but singer. That being so, the same <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> seems more appropriate in other verses also, which I formerly translated differently, e. g.

Although this hymn is not directly addressed to the Maruts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> as it refers to the before-mentioned rivalry between the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> and Indra, and as the author is supposed to be the same, namely Agastya, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> its translation here.

None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.

The Anukramanika ascribes verses 1, 3, 4 to Indra, 2 and 5 to Agastya; Ludwig assigns verses 1 and 3 to the Maruts, 2, 4, and 5 to Agastya; Grassmann gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 1 to Indra, 2 and 3 to the Maruts, and 4 and 5 to Agastya.

The hymn admits of several explanations. There was a sacrifice in which Indra and the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> were invoked together, and it is quite possible that our hymn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> owe its origin to this. But it is possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that the sacrifice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be the embodiment of the same ideas which were originally expressed in this and similar hymns, namely, that Indra, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> powerful by himself; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not dispense with the assistance of the storm-gods.

The idea that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Indra did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to be praised <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> is an <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> idea, and we find traces of it in the hymns themselves, e. g. II, 33, 4. ma' duhstuti, ma' sahuti.

It is quite possible, therefore, that our hymn contains the libretto of a little ceremonial drama in which <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> choruses of priests are introduced as preparing a sacrifice for the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> and for Indra, and as trying to appease the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Indra, who is supposed to feel slighted. Possibly Indra and the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> too <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been actually represented by some actors, so that here, as elsewhere, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> seeds of the drama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in sacrificial performances.

Verses 4 and 5 belong to Agastya, who, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> frightened into obedience to Indra, still implores him to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> his peace with the Maruts.

NOTES.

The Anukramani assigns verses 1 and 2 to the Maruts, the rest to Indra Marutvat. The poet is again Agastya. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> hymn corresponds to the situation as described in the preceding hymns, and leads on to a kind of compromise between the Maruts, who seem really the favourite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the poet, and Indra, an irresistible and supreme deity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> claims <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be disregarded.

Panini (VII, 4, 2, 3) gives a number of verbs which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> that aorist as      , and not as       e. g. asasasat, not asisasat; ababadhat, ayayakat, &c.

16. They, the wise [*1] Maruts, the lords, who, when there was inquiry for their kindred, told me of the cow, they told me of Prisni as their mother, and of the strong Rudra as their father.

17. The seven and seven heroes [*1] gave me each a hundred. On the Yamuna I clear off glorious wealth in cows, I clear wealth in horses.

Ludwig translates: 'Sich verteilend gehn die schimmernden auszeinander.' Grassmann, very boldly: 'Wie Hengste traufelnd, wenn vom Wege heimgekehrt, sie zu den bunten Stuten gehn.' Vi-vrit seems, however, to have a very special meaning, namely, rolling on the ground, and this the spotted deer are here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have done, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> horses at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of their journey.

NOTES.

The same poet, Syavasva Atreya. Metre, 1-9 Gagati; 10 Trishtubh. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Verse</span> 5 is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in TS. II, 4, 8, 2; MS. II, 4, 7. The refrain probably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that when the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> march in triumph, the chariots of their army, or the chariots of other gods, follow. The latter view is taken by Sayana, TS. II, 4, 8, 2.

TO THE <span class="t20 hoverable">MARUTS</span> (THE STORM-GODS).

1. O Agni, on to the strong host (of the Maruts), bedecked with golden chains and ornaments [*1].

Regnaud, Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1890. Prof. Roth, as M. Regnaud states, explains it by conseil, avis, reunion ou l'on delibere, assemblee, troupe, armee.

Ludwig derives it likewise from vid, but in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> .of Bekanntschaft, then Gesellschaft, and lastly as synonymous with yagna, sacrifice, assemblage. M. Regnaud differs from all his predecessors, and derives vidatha from vidh, to sacrifice.

NOTES.

This hymn is of a very composite nature. It is addressed to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> by Syavasva. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to the Anukramani, however, the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> are addressed in vv. 1-4, 11-16 only; vv. 5-8 are addressed to Sasiyasi Tarantamahishi, 9 to Purumilha Vaidadasvi, 10 to Taranta Vaidadasvi, 17-19 to Rathaviti Darbhya. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS. Metre, 1-4, 6-8, 10-19 Gayatri; 5 Anushtubh; 9 Satobrihati.

It has been pointed out that in the hymns addressed to the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> beginning with V, 52, and ending with V, 60, there is the usual decrease in the number of verses of each successive hymn, viz. 17, 16, 15, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8. Our hymn, however, which is the last in the collection of hymns addressed by Syavasva to the Maruts, breaks the rule, and it has been suggested with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> plausibility that it contains a number of verses thrown <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> at random. Possibly the four verses in the beginning formed an independent hymn, addressed to the Maruts, and again 5-10, and 11-16, followed by an appendix, 17-19. These verses refer to a legend which will have to be discussed at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 5.

NOTES.

This hymn is evidently a later addition at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the fifth Mandala. It is addressed to the Maruts, and is ascribed to Evayamarut Atreya. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS., except the first, which is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in SV. I, 462. Metre, Atigagati.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the poet is due to the refrain Evaya'marut which occurs in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> verse, and sometimes as an integral portion of the verse.

Evayah, as I explained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> to I, 168, 1, is an epithet of Vishnu, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as of the Maruts, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> quickly moving. Evayamarut, therefore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mean the 'quick Marut.' This is strange, no doubt, because in the Rig-veda the <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> always occur in the plural, except in some doubtful passages. Still Evayamarut, the quick Marut, <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Vishnu.

This hymn was translated by Benfey in his glossary to the Sama-veda, p. 39. Benfey takes evaya as identical with eyoi, and explains it as an adverbial instrumental, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> asuya, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of sturmisch.

This hymn has been translated by Geldner and Kaegi. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> is most difficult. G.-K. avoid all difficulties by translating, 'Beim Fest des sussen Trankes weiss <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> tuchtig euch zu begeistern, hehre Schaar der Marut.' Ludwig grapples with them by translating; 'An eures madhu kraft, o zu vererende, freut bei den opfern sich der Marut geschlecht.' I doubt, however, whether savas is ever ascribed to madhu, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is ascribed to Soma. Oldenberg suggests, 'The sweet ones' is your Marut-name, O worshipful, they who rejoice in their strength at the sacrifices.' Here the difficulty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be that Marutam nama is the recognised term for the name, i. e. the kin of the Maruts. Still, unless we venture on a conjecture, this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem to be the best rendering. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Could</span> we change madhvah vah na'ma ma'rutam into madhvad vah na'ma ma'rutam? Madhvad is a Vedic word, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it occurs once only, in I, 164, 22, and as trisyllabic. Its very rarity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> help to <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for the change.

It has been proved that the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> madati is always neutral, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> to rejoice, while mand (Par.) is transitive, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> rejoice.

From this he proceeds to argue that the original <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of dhaman, from which all <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> are derived, is law. But <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> is a very late and very abstract word, and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> forget that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> always progress from the concrete to the abstract, from the material to the spiritual, and but seldom, and at a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> later time, in an opposite direction. Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if we were to admit that dhaman does not occur in the Veda in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of settlement, i. e. abode, this is certainly its most general <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> afterwards, and no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> maintain that a settlement, i. e. a household, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> dhaman, because it involved a settlement, i. e. laws. The same applies to vrata. Bergaigne (III, 213) agrees with me that vrata should be derived from var, to surround, to guard, and not from var, to choose, but he thinks that it meant at once 'garde, protection,'

[p. 384]

and not 'lieu clos.' I still hold that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> nomos, vrata <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have meant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> a real hedge, or erkos, and then only an abstract enclosure, i. e. a law, nomos.

But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be impossible to begin, as Bergaigne (p. 216) does, with the abstract <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of protection, law, and then return and use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> in such phrases as V, 46, 7. apa'm vrate, 'within the pale of the waters.'

Dhaman, therefore, meant originally, I still believe, what was actually laid down or settled, hence an abode. When, as in the Veda, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> law, I do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that this was necessarily derived from the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of abode. I only maintain that it was a second, if not a secondary, meaning, and that, at all events, the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of abode <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be derived from that of law.

After dhaman meant what is settled, it has sometimes to be translated by law, by nature, sometimes by class, or clan, where it comes very near to naman, name, while sometimes it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> best be rendered by a general and abstract suffix, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by a plural. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> in our passage, daivyasya dha'mnah is not very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from devanam.

What is peculiar to our passage is the genitive governed by tuvishman. After all the learning which Bergaigne has expended on the analysis of dhaman, he does not help us to a translation of our sentence. If we translate 'of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> law, powerful,' we have words, but no sense.

IV, 37, 5. oshadhinam virudham viryavati:. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> Kuhn, Zeitschrift XIII, 120; Siecke, Genitivus, p. 14.

TO THE <span class="t20 hoverable">MARUTS</span> AND RUDRA.

1. Whom you protect again and again, O gods, and whom you lead, to him, O Agni, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, and Maruts, yield your protection.

2. He who sacrifices, O gods, overcomes his enemies by your protection on a happy day. He who gives to your delight, spreads <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> his dwelling, spreads out <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> food.

O Maruts, who <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> miss the Soma mead, hail to you here to enjoy yourselves.

7.

[p. 387]

9. O you Maruts, full of heat, here is the libation; be pleased to accept it, O you who destroy the enemies by your help [*1].

10. O you who accept the domestic sacrifices [*1], <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> hither, O Maruts, do not keep away, you who are bounteous by your help [*2].

We sacrifice to Tryambaka [*1], the sweet-scented, wealth-increasing (Rudra). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> I be detached from death, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a gourd from its stem, but not [*2] from the immortal [*3].

ASHTAKA V, ADHYAYA 8, VARGA 18-24.

  

TO THE <span class="t20 hoverable">MARUTS</span> (THE STORM-GODS).

1. When the sage has poured out the threefold [*1] draught to you, O Maruts, then you shine <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in the mountains (clouds).

2. Aye, when, O bright Maruts, growing in strength, you have seen your way, then the mountains (clouds) have gone down [*1].

3. The <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Prisni, the bulls, have risen <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with the winds, they have drawn <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> the swelling draught.

4. The <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> sow the mist, they shake the mountains (clouds), when they go their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with the winds,

5. When the mountain bent down before your march, the rivers before your rule, before your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (blast).

6. We invoke you by night for our protection, you by day, you while the sacrifice proceeds.

7. And they rise up on their courses, the beautiful, of reddish hue [*1], the bulls, above the ridge of the sky.

8. With <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> they send <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> a ray of light, that the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have a path to walk [*1]: they have spread <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> and wide with their lights.

9. Accept, O Maruts, this my speech, this hymn of praise, O Ribhukshans [*1], this my call.

10. The Prisnis [*1] (the clouds) yielded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lakes (from their udders) as mead for the wielder of the thunderbolt (Indra), the well, the water-skin, the watering-pot [*2].

11. O Maruts, whenever we call you from heaven, wishing for your favour, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> hither towards us.

12. For you are bounteous [*1], in our house, O Rudras, Ribhukshans: you are attentive, when you enjoy (the libations).

13. O Maruts, <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> to us from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> enrapturing wealth, which nourishes many, which satisfies all.

17. These <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Prisni rise up <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with rattlings, with chariots, with the winds, and with songs of praise.

18. That (help) with which you helped Turvasa, Yadu, and Kanva when he carried off riches, that we pray for, greatly for our wealth.

19. O bounteous Maruts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> these draughts, swelling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> butter, strengthen you, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with the prayers of Kanva.

20. Where do you rejoice now, O bounteous Maruts, when an altar has been prepared for you? What priest serves you?

21. For you for whom we have prepared an altar, do not, as it was with you formerly, in return for these praises, gladden the companies of our sacrifice.

22. These <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> have <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> piece

24. They protected the strength and <span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the fighting Trita, they protected Indra in his struggle with Vritra.

25. Holding lightnings in their hands, they hasten heavenward, golden helmets [*1] are on their head; the brilliant <span class="t20 hoverable">Maruts</span> have adorned themselves for beauty.

26. When with Usana [*2] you have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from afar to Ukshnorandhra (ox-hollow) [*1], he roared from fear, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Dyu (the sky).

However, in an article lately published by Roth on Wergeld in the Veda (Z. D. M. G.

It differs little from vaginivat, which is likewise applied to the Asvins, I, 120, 10, and comes to mean simply wealthy, liberal; cf. I, 122, 8; VII, 69, 1.

NOTES ON THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS INDEX.

The format of this transcription of the index varies slightly from the printed version so that this section can be parsed automatically if needed.

In the printed edition, the main entry appeared on a line by itself, followed by a colon, with successive forms on the next line indented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> level. Sub-entries appeared on separate lines, with more indentation. The entries have been, essentially, flattened in this transcription: in other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries and lines.

Only explicit page number references have been hyperlinked.

In the printed version, footnotes are indicated by superscripts. In this transcription, footnotes are prefixed by a colon following the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> number. For instance, X, 77, 2:1 originally appeared as X, 77, 21. In the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> where multiple superscripts appeared, a colon followed by the footnotes in square brackets: X, 77, 2:[1, 2] was originally X, 77, 21, 2. However, footnotes with lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.) are transcribed with a superscript, e. g. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Note</span> a, as in the original. This only applies to the Index of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Words</span> section: everywhere else in the transcription of this book, superscripts are used to indicate footnotes as in the original.--JBH

A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL LIST OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PUBLICATIONS ON THE RIG-VEDA.

I have often stated how <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> I was indebted to the labours of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> in all I have endeavoured to do for the Veda. I have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the same acknowledgment once more. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> of those with whom I once worked side by side have ceased from their labours, but the gaps which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> has caused have been filled by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> young and equally valiant soldiers. I am almost afraid to mention names, lest I should seem forgetful of some by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> labours I have benefitted. The elaborate publications of M. Bergaigne occupy a prominent place, and seem to me to have hardly received the credit which they deserve. Scholars are too apt to forget that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> differ from the results arrived at by our colleagues, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> admire their industry, their acumen, their genius. Professor Ludwig has continued his work, undismayed by the unjust and unseemly attacks of his rivals. Professor Oldenberg's contributions, Das altindische Akhyana, 1883; Rigveda-Samhita and Samavedarcika, 1884; Die Adhyayatheilung des Rigveda, 1887, and lastly, the Prolegomena to his Hymnen des Rigveda, 1888, have opened <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> and important fields of critical investigation. <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">Different</span> views have been ably represented by Pischel and Geldner in their Vedische Studien.

Professor Avery's Contributions to the History of Verb-Inflection in Sanskrit (1875), Professor Lanman's Statistical <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">Account</span> of Noun-inflection in the Veda (1877), are indispensable helps to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> student of the Veda. Professor Delbruck's Syntaktische Forschungen (1871-1879) and Das Altindische Verbum (1874) marked a decided advance in critical scholarship.

The nominal suffixes have been treated by Bruno Lindner in his Altindische Nominalbildung (1878); the suffixes of the Infinitive by Professor Ludwig (1871) and Professor Wilhelm (1870 and 1873). Geldner and Professor Kaegi have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a popular and useful <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the results of Vedic studies in Siebenzig Lieder des Rigveda (1875), and Der Rigveda (1881).

The following is a list of the more important publications on the Rig-veda which have proved useful to myself and will prove useful to others. This list does not pretend to be complete, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in its incomplete form, I hope that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be serviceable to students of the Rig-veda.
