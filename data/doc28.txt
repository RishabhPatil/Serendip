PREFACE
By PERITUS
The Jesuits are different. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> Catholic Priest knows this. The Jesuits have an
uncanny manner financially. Operating behind the scenes, they seem very inconspicuous,
but when the wills of rich Catholics, and very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> non-Catholics, are filed for probate.
strangely some Jesuit institution is there for a sizable amount.
They are so <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in their priestly deportment and social conduct too, that other
priests feel ill at ease and uncomfortable in their presence. A priestly "blast" <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> really
gets organized until after the Jesuits have gone home. The prevailing atmosphere, when
they are present, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of uneasy suspicion. Other priests feel as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the "Jebbies" will

ridiculous because most bishops are just as leery of the Jesuits as are the working clergy.
Lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> think that Jesuits are different. They speak of the Society of <span class="t5 t11 t21 t22 t28 hoverable">Jesus</span> as
the "educated clergy,"-the "teaching arm of the church". They have the "most
schools"-which is true. The quality of those schools is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> question. None of them, at
least in the U.S. has ever won an award for the volume of scientists or philosophers it
produced. Voltaire <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to a Jesuit school. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> later that he learned Latin and
nonsense.

The Jesuits write the most books-which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> true. In fact it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that any Jesuit

Judging by a perusal of them, the subject matter or the treatment seems of very little

Secret Instructions of the Society of <span class="t5 t11 t21 t22 t28 hoverable">Jesus</span>
The laity are told that the Jesuits are smarter than other priests because they go to
school longer. The laity do not realize that for some <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> those Jesuits are in their schools
not as students, but as teachers-callow, young, inexperienced boys carrying on the "great
tradition" of Jesuit education.
The laity, Catholic and non-Catholic, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> told that the Jesuits are <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more
selective in their choice of candidates than other orders or diocesan seminaries. They pick
only the smarter and more promising youngsters and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> insure a continuing crop of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
scholars, teachers, philosophers, orators and, not mentioned, ecclesiastical politicians.
The <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is, as clerical wags have <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> it, that the Jesuits have just as large a
percentage of lesser Esq.'s as any other church <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> but they are smart enough to hide
the numbskulls in their foreign missions to primitive countries. In fact, it has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> been said,
that this is the principal reason why the Jesuits have foreign missions.
However, in spite of these disparaging introductory qualifications, there can be no
gainsaying the fact that the Jesuits possess a hard core of extremely intelligent, intensely
loyal, politically shrewd, carefully calculating individuals. This has been so <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span>
of their founder, Ignatius of Loyola. A catalog of their names <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> include a large
percentage of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> minds of the Roman Catholic Church <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the sixteenth century.
Any honest student of church history <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> admit that behind the scenes, they have
been the governing genius of the Vatican- <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> though, more often than not, an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
genius.
The Jesuit <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> is an absolute monarchy. Their general, "the Black Pope" rules for
life. The pattern of their own <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> has molded their thinking about all other political
structures, including, but not confined to, the Vatican.
The Jesuits fought the democratic aspirations of the French when they helped
engineer the "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve". They were the force behind Pope Pius
IX and were his principal counselors. The Italian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> knew that the Jesuits were the
strongest opponents of the Unification of Italy and hated them accordingly. The Jesuits
promoted the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and of the Infallibility of the Pope.
They wart, the experts behind the experts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> Vatican Council in 1870 just as they
are of the Second Vatican Council.
It is obvious that an organization so vast (the largest in the Roman Church) covering
the globe, and engaged in so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> activities, some open and honorable, and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>
secret, delicate and "Jesuitical" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to have a <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> of rules and regulations for its

own internal control <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more detailed and stringent than the conventional "rules" or
"constitutions" of St. Benedict, St. Francis or the other run-of-the-mill orders and
congregations.

Knowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that the bulk of the Jesuits at the grass roots did not possess the
sagacity, shrewdness and ruthlessness of the "boys" in the "back room" in Rome it was
necessary that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> enterprises, such as "advising" rich widows, picking of rich men's
<span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> to be prospective Jesuits, or purging the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of a hapless Jesuit who began to
think for himself, should be speeded out in detail.
But above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> it was necessary that such regulations should be kept secret. They
were to be confided only to trusted superiors and if accidentally found. they were to be
denounced as base forgeries.
They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "MONIKA SECRETA SOCIETATIS JESU"-"The Secret Instructions
of the Society of Jesus."
The average "lower-case" Jesuit, not being in on the know, will sincerely tell indignant
devout inquirers that these regulations are fictitious. The smart "upper-case" Jesuit knows
that he had better deny their existence. He <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> not live to regret his indiscretion.
The existence of the "Secret Regulations of the Jesuits" has been proven beyond all
possibility of successful legal refutation.
Most unbiased historians of the Roman Catholic Church and of the Jesuits
acknowledge the existence of the "Monita".
The British historian, Andrew Steinmetz, in his monumental, precisely documented,
"History of the Jesuits", published in London in 1848, devotes several pages to an analysis
of the genuineness and history of the "Monita". He outlines the <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> with the same
succession of chapters and content as reproduced in this <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> volume. He concludes
that "secret regulations" did exist, considering 1) overt statements of Jesuit Generals, 2)
missing chapters in early editions of the official "Constitutions", and 3) the actual conduct
of the Jesuits, in so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> countries and for so long. As proof of the latter he cites the
catering to the rich, the rapid acquisition of tremendous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and wealth and the
infiltration of the royal powers by the Jesuits as court confessors, with their tolerance of
licentiousness in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to gain power. (Vol. III, p. 363, 364, 365, 366). Of the allegations
themselves he cites thousands of documented instances in the 1660 pages of his
volumes.
The following paragraphs are from the autobiography of a very precise and erudite exJesuit. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> places him and his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> beyond the customary effective reprisals of the
Order.

"The importance of the publication follows from the fact that, directly after its
appearance, the General of the Order, Mutius Vitelleschi, twice (in 1616 and 1617)
instructed the German Jesuit, Gretser, a prominent theologian of the Order, to refute it, and
that up to most recent times Jesuit after Jesuit has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> forward to repudiate it."
"It is natural that the Jesuits themselves should deny the genuineness in a flood of
refutations. But such denials only merit the belief or unbelief which the denial of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
defendant deserves. Only sound proof can turn the scale against the genuineness of the
Monita. And such proofs have not been produced up to now by the Jesuits. Nor has any
convincing invalidation of the facts advanced on behalf of its genuineness been produced.
"The advocates of their genuineness rely essentially on the fact that the manuscript
copies of the Monita, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the printed edition is based, were to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in Jesuit
colleges. The discovery of such copies in the colleges of Prague, Paris, Roermond
(Holland), Munich, and Paderborn is beyond question. The copy in the Jesuit <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in
Paderborn was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> 'in a cupboard in the Rector's room' (in scriniis rectoris). The
manuscript copy at Munich, belonging to the contents of the library of the Jesuit college of
this place, which was suppressed in 1773, was only <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in 1870 in a secret recess
behind the altar of the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Jesuit Church of St. Michael at Munich. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a decisive
token of genuineness if it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be proved positively that the Prague copy was already
there in 1611 -- i.e. before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> printed edition in 1612. J. Friedrich's statement makes
this seem probable, but not certain. What the Jesuit Duhr writes to the contrary is of no
value. It is certain, however, that the discovery in Prague was so disagreeable to the
Jesuits that the chief champion of the spuriousness of the MONITA, the Jesuit Forer,
considered it advisable to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> it over in silence in his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of repudiation, Anatomia

disputed- that the copy at Paderborn was only <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> edition had

his book, treats the Prague discovery as a fact. The <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> that those who keep silence

Secret Instructions of the Society of <span class="t5 t11 t21 t22 t28 hoverable">Jesus</span>
The <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the "Secret Instructions of the Society of Jesus" reproduced here was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span>
beneath the pallet on an adobe bed in a cottage in the Andes Mountains of Peru about a
century ago.
Students of the Incas recall that prior to the expedition of the National Geographic
Magazine under Hiram Bingham, in 1911, archaeologists from European countries probed
the ruins of this people, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the greatest civilizations in history.
In 1870 a French archeologist slipped unobtrusively into the office of the Secretary of
the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in San Francisco, California.
He had been sent into the remote recesses of the Andes, where Pizarro and his army
had conquered the Incas more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries before. He had rented a room in a tiny
village. This he used as a base of his operations. To this spot he returned periodically to
rest from the dangerously high altitudes and to write his reports for shipment back to
France.
While he was away, the family frequently rented the same room to overnight guests.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of these happened to be a Jesuit official. On his departure he forgot a little <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span>
which he had hidden under the mattress. The French archeologist accidentally <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> it.
It was the "Secret Instructions of the Society of Jesus"- the top classified manual of
procedure for the trusted leaders of the Jesuit Order.
It was in Latin and bore the seal, signature and attestation of the General and Secretary of
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> in Rome.
For the next few <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> the Frenchman labored furiously translating the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in
stenographic notes into French. He then replaced the <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> and left.
The Jesuit returned in a few <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> inquiring nervously about his little black packet. He
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> if anyone had occupied the room <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> his departure. On learning of
the archeologist he began a search so relentless that the Frenchman had to leave Peru.
He finally reached San Francisco and entrusted his precious but dangerous burden to
Edwin A. Sherman 32 degree Mason, the Secretary of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in
California.
Mr. Sherman included the "Secret Instructions" in his <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> "The Engineer Corps of
Hell" published in 1882.

For several <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> Edwin Sherman was the Masonic Historian of California. He was
highly esteemed for his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> accuracy and dependability. This can be verified now by
anyone who will inquire about him of the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of
Freemasonry at the Grand Lodge office in the Masonic Memorial Temple, 1111 California
St., San Francisco, Calif.
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> point that emphasizes the credibility of this <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is the identity of this copy,

Hoensbroech in Germany, Considering that Von Hoensbroech's rendition was translated
from the German and Sherman's from Latin to French and then into English the similarity
is still striking.
Here are a few examples:

Sherman: Ch. XI -- "How We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Must</span> Conduct Ourselves Unitedly Against
Those Who Have Been Expelled From the
Society."

Von Hoensbroech:

"What Attitude Should Be Taken By Our Followers

In Regard to Those Dismissed From the Order?"

Sherman: Ch. VI -- "OF the Mode of Attracting Rich Widows."

Von Hoensbroech:

"How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> Rich Widows be <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">Well</span> Disposed Towards

the Society of Jesus?"

Sherman: Ch. IV -- "OF That Which We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Must</span> Charge the Preachers and

Von Hoensbroech:

"What Attitude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Must</span> be Taken up by

Court-Chaplains and Princely Confessors?"
The <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> that follows is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most effective documents ever written. The
tremendous wealth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Jesuit <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> is ample proof of that contention.
Those who have observed the Jesuits from the vantage point of the secular clergy or
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> have often wondered at their astounding success in becoming the
recipients of wealthy estates, of influencing prominent citizens, Catholic and non-Catholic
alike, into endorsing and endowing their colleges and universities, of instilling their
scholastics and other students with a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of self-dedication and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> immolation that

A careful study of the "Secret Instructions" will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the answer. Here is a plan of
financial, intellectual and military strategy that should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the planners of West Point or

Check, for example the following:

(Think then how <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> the Jesuits have done with the local State Bar, the Chamber of

Ch. VI-"OF THE MODE OF ATTRACTING RICH WIDOWS."
Just read them and weep, brethren! Read especially this sentence p. 8 "Insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

condoling over them." (Ch. V. p. 17)
Read the Jesuits' opinion of other religious orders "calling attention to the indolence
and stupidity of the Monks as if they were cattle." (Ch. XVII P. 41)
The Jesuits themselves should be concerned with the fact that history does repeat
itself. In Mexico, in Peru, in France, in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in Portugal, in Paraguay,
in Colombia, in Brazil, in Argentina, in Chile, in Austria and in very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> other countries
the Jesuits gained so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> wealth, in land, in buildings and in money, that <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> became
jealous.
In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> country the Jesuits were thrown out. Their property and wealth was
confiscated.
The Jesuits are now repeating their history in the United States of America. Their
landed wealth and holdings are fabulous.
What makes them think that history will not inexorably and inevitably repeat itself again
here in America?

To capture the will of the inhabitants of a country, it is very important to
manifest the intent of the Society, in the manner prescribed in the regulations in which it is
said, that the Society <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> labor with such ardor and force for the salvation of their
neighbor as for themselves. For the better inducement of this idea, the most opportunely
that we practice the most humble offices, visiting the poor, the afflicted, and the
imprisoned. It is very convenient to confess with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> promptness, and to hear the
confessions, showing indifference, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> teasing the penitents; for this, the most notable

It is necessary to do all that is possible to gain completely the attentions and
affections of princes and persons of the most consideration; for that, who, being on the
outside, but in advance, all of them will be constituted our defenders.

As we have learned by experience that princes and potentates are generally
inclined to the favor of the ecclesiastics, when these disseminate their odious actions, and
when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an interpretation that they favor, as is to be noted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the married,

If at this same assembly the prince treats of doing something, that will not be

The experience we have had, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> us acquainted with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
advantages that have been taken by the Society of its intervention in the marriages of the

Poland, and in various duchies. Forasmuch assembling, proposing with prudence,
selecting choice persons who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be friends and families of the relatives, and of the
friends of the Society.

It will be easy to gain the princesses, making use of their valets; by that,
coming to feed and nourish with relations of friendship, by being located at the entrance in
all parts, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> acquainted with the most intimate secrets of the familiars.

In regard to the direction of the consciences of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men, we confessors

is to appear too religious; for that they will decide to leave <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> and submit entirely to our
direction and counsels.
9.

It is necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> reference to all the merits of the

Society; to the princes and prelates, and to as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> as can lend <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> aid to the Society,
after having shown the transcendence of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> privileges.
10.
Also, it will be useful to demonstrate, with prudence and skill, such ample
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which the Society has, to absolve, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the reserved cases, compared with that
of other pastors and priests; also, that of dispensing with the fasts, and of the rights which
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> ask and pay, in the impediments of marriage, by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> persons
will recur to us, whom it will be our duty to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> agreeable.
11.
It is not the less useful to invite them to our sermons, assemblies,
harangues, declamations, etc., composing odes in their honor, dedicating literary <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> or
conclusions; and if we can for the future, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> dinners and greetings of divers modes.
12.
It will be very convenient to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> to our care the reconciliation of the great, in
the quarrels and enmities that divide them; then by this method we can enter, little by little,
into the acquaintance of their most intimate friends and secrets; and we can serve
ourselves to that party which will be most in favor of that which we present.
13.
If there should be some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> at the service of a monarch or prince, and he
were an enemy of our Society, it is necessary to procure <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> for ourselves better than for
others, making him a friend, employing promises, favors, and advances, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be in
proportion to the same monarch or prince.
14.
No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> recommend to a prince any one, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> advances to any
who have gone out from us, being outside of our Society, and in particular to those who
voluntarily verified, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> when they dissimulate they will always maintain an

1.
The care consigned to us, that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> do all that is possible, for to conquer
the great; but it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> necessary to gain their favor to combat our enemies.
2.
It is very conducive to value their authority, prudence and counsels, and
induce them to despise wealth, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that we procure gain and employ those
that can redeem the Society; tacitly valuing their names, for acquisition of temporal goods
if they inspire sufficient confidence.
3.
It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> necessary to employ the ascendant of the powerful, to temper the
malevolence of the persons of a lower sphere and of the rabble against our Society.
4.
It is necessary to utilize, whenever we can, the bishops, prelates and other
superior ecclesiastics, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the diversity of reason, and the inclination we manifest.
5.
In some points it will be sufficient to obtain of the prelates and curates, that
which it is possible to do, that their subjects respect the society; and that obstructing the
exercise of its functions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> those who have the greatest power, as in Germany,
Poland, etc. It will be necessary to exhibit the most distinguished attentions for that,
mediating its authority and that of the princes, monasteries, parishes, priorates,
patronates, the foundations of the churches and the pious places, can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to our power.
Because we can with more facility where the Catholics will be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> mixed with heretics. It
is necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> such prelates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the utility and merit that we have in all this, and
that <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> will they have so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> valuation from the priests, friars, and for the future from
the faithful. If making these changes, it is necessary to publicly praise their zeal, although
written, and to perpetuate the memory of their actions.
6.
For this it is necessary to labor, to the end, that the prelates will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the
hands of us fathers, as confessors and counselors; and if they aspire to more elevated
positions in the Court of Rome, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> unite in their favor and aid their pretensions with
all our forces, and by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of our influence.

and parochial churches, that the faculties are taken from the Society, and placed in both
vicarious establishments, with the charge of cures, and that the Superior of

Where there are those of the academies who have been driven out from us,
and are contrary; where the Catholics or the heretics obstruct our installation, we will
compound with the prelates, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> ourselves the owners of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> cathedrals; for

9.
Over all, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be very <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> to procure the protection and affection of the
prelates of the Church, for the cases of beatification or canonization of ourselves; in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>

To most of the cases expressed in the Constitutions, and of which only the
Superior or the ordinary confessor, with permission of this, can absolve them, where there
is sodomy, unnatural crime, formication, adultery, of the unchaste touch of a man, or of a
woman; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> if under the pretext of Zeal, or whatever motive, they have done some grave

If anyone confesses in the confessional of having committed some similar act,
he will not be promised absolution, until he has promised to reveal to the Superior, outside
of the confessional, the same or by his confessor. The Superior will operate the better for
it, in the general interests of the Society; further, if there is founded hope of the careful
hiding of the crime, it will be necessary to impose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the guilty a convenient
