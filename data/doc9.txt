                                PREFACE.


The ‘Duff Lectures’ for 1888 were delivered by me at Edinburgh in the
month of March. In introducing my subject, I spoke to the following
effect:—

‘I wish to express my deep <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the responsibility which the writing
of these Lectures has laid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me, and my earnest desire that they may,
by their usefulness, prove in some degree worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> missionary

‘Dr. Duff was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of power, who left his own foot-print so deeply
impressed on the soil of Bengal, that its traces are <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> likely to be
effaced, and still serve to encourage less ardent spirits, who are
striving to imitate his example in the same field of labour.

‘But not only is the impress of his vigorous personality still fresh in
Bengal. He has earned an enduring reputation throughout India and the
United Kingdom, as the prince of educational missionaries. He was in all
that he undertook an enthusiastic and indefatigable workman, of whom, if
of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> being, it <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be truly said, that, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to
quit the sphere of his labours, “he needed not to be ashamed.” No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

but better than these will be the living testimony of successive
generations of Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> growth and progress in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> the increase.’

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> a few more <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> expressive of my hope that the ‘Life of Dr.
Duff’[1] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be read and pondered by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> student destined for <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of any kind in our Indian empire, and to that biography I refer all who
are unacquainted with the particulars of the labours of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to whom
Scotland has assigned a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the foremost rank of her most eminent
Evangelists.

I now proceed to explain the process by which these Lectures have
gradually outgrown the limits required by the Duff Trustees.

When I addressed myself to the carrying out of their wishes—communicated
to me by Mr. W. Pirie Duff—I had no intention of undertaking more than a
concise <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of a subject which I had been studying for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> years. I
conceived it possible to compress into six Lectures a scholarly sketch
of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism,—that is, the Buddhism of the
Pi?akas or Pali texts which are now being edited by the Pali <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">Text</span>
Society, and some of which have been translated in the ‘Sacred Books of
the East.’ It soon, however, became apparent to me that to write an
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of Buddhism which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Indian
missionary, I ought to exhibit it in its connexion with Brahmanism and
Hinduism and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> with Jainism, and in its contrast with Christianity.
Then, as I proceeded, I began to feel that to do justice to my subject I
should be compelled to enlarge the range of my researches, so as to
embrace some of the later phases and modern developments of Buddhism.
This led me to undertake a more careful study of Koeppen’s Lamaismus
than I had before <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> necessary. Furthermore, I felt it my duty to
study attentively numerous treatises on Northern Buddhism, which I had
before read in a cursory manner. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it incumbent on me to
look a little into the Tibetan language, of which I was before wholly
ignorant.

I need scarcely explain further the process of expansion through which
the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has passed. A conviction took possession of my mind,
that any endeavour to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> an outline of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> subject of
Buddhism in six Lectures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be rather <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the effort of a foolish

the expansion of six Lectures into eighteen, and it will be seen at once
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of these eighteen are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> too <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> to have been delivered _in
extenso_. In point of fact, by an arrangement with the Trustees, only a
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> portion of any Lecture was delivered orally. The <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
rather a treatise on Buddhism printed and published in memory of Dr.
Duff.

I need not encumber the Preface with a re-statement of the reasons which
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the elucidation of an intricate subject almost hopelessly
difficult. They have been stated in the Introductory Lecture (pp. 13,
14).

Moreover the plan of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> volume has been there <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> (see p.
17).

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> possibly be asked by weary readers why I have ventured to add
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> tributary to the too swollen stream of treatises on Buddhism? or
some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> employ <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> metaphor and inquire why I have troubled myself
to toil and plod over a path already <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> travelled over and trodden
down? My reply is that I think I can claim for my own <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> an
individuality which separates it from that of others—an individuality
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> probably commend it to thoughtful students of Buddhism as
helping to clear a thorny road, and introduce some little <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> and
coherence into the chaotic confusion of Buddhistic ideas.

At any rate I request permission to draw attention to the following
points, which, I think, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> invest my researches with a distinctive
character of their own.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> I have been able to avail myself of the latest
publications of the Pali <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">Text</span> Society, and to consult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> recent <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span>
which previous writers on Buddhism have not had at their command.

Secondly, I have striven to combine scientific accuracy with a popular
exposition sufficiently readable to satisfy the wants of the cultured
English-speaking world—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> crowded with intelligent readers who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span>
an increasing interest in Buddhism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> of Sansk?it,
Pali, and Tibetan.

Thirdly, I have aimed at effecting what no other English Orientalist
has, to my knowledge, ever accomplished. I have endeavoured to deal with
a complex subject as a whole, and to <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> volume a
comprehensive survey of the entire range of Buddhism, from its earliest
origin in India to its latest modern developments in other Asiatic
countries.

Fourthly, I have <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the study of Buddhism and its sacred
language Pali, a life-long preparatory study of Brahmanism and its
sacred language Sansk?it.

Fifthly, I have on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> occasions travelled through the sacred <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of
Buddhism (p. 21), and have carried on my investigations personally in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of its origin, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as in Ceylon and on the borders of
Tibet.

Lastly, I have depicted Buddhism from the standpoint of a believer in
Christianity, who has shown, by his other <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> on Eastern religions, an
earnest desire to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> them credit for all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> they contain.

In regard to this last point, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> probably be told by some
enthusiastic admirers of Buddhism, that my prepossessions and
predilections—inherited with my Christianity—have, in spite of my desire
to be just, distorted my view of a system with which I have no sympathy.
To this I can only reply, that my consciousness of my own prepossessions
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> me the more sensitively anxious to exhibit Buddhism under its
best aspects, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as under its worst. An attentive perusal of my
last Lecture (see p. 537) will, I hope, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it evident that I have at
least done everything in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to dismiss all prejudice from my mind,
and to assume and maintain the attitude of an impartial judge. And to
this <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> I have taken <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> on trust, or at second hand. I have
studied Pali, as I have the other Indian Prak?its, on my own account,
and independently. I have not accepted unreservedly any man’s
interpretation of the original Buddhist texts, and have endeavoured to
verify for myself all doubtful statements and translations which occur
in existing treatises. Of course I owe <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to modern Pali scholars, and
writers on Buddhism, and to the translators of the ‘Sacred Books of the
East;’ but I have frequently felt compelled to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> an independent
opinion of my own.

The translations <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the ‘Sacred Books of the East’—good as they
generally are—have seemed to me occasionally misleading. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mention
as an instance the constant employment by the translators of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
‘Ordination’ for the ceremonies of admission to the Buddhist monkhood
(see pp. 76-80 of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> volume). I have ventured in such instances
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> what has appeared to me a more suitable equivalent for the Pali.
On the same principle I have avoided all needless employment of
Christian terminology and Bible-language to express Buddhist ideas.

For example, I have in most cases excluded such <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> as ‘sin,’
‘holiness,’ ‘faith’, ‘trinity,’ ‘priest’ from my explanations of the
Buddhist creed, as wholly unsuitable.

I regret that want of space has compelled me to curtail my observations
on Jainism—the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> representative of Buddhistic doctrines in India
(see p. 529.) I hope to enter more fully on this subject hereafter.

The names of authors to whom students of Buddhism are indebted are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Lecture (pp. 14, 15). We all owe <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to Childers. My own
thanks are specially due to General Sir Alexander Cunningham, to
Professor E. B. Cowell of Cambridge, Professor Rhys Davids, Dr.
Oldenberg, Dr. Rost, Dr. Morris, Dr. Wenzel, who have aided me with
their opinions, whenever I have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to consult them. Dr.
Rost, C.I.E., of the India Office, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> entitled to my warmest
acknowledgments for having placed at my disposal various subsidiary
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> bearing on Buddhism, some of which belong to his own Library.

My obligations to Mr. Hoey’s translation of Dr. Oldenberg’s ‘Buddha,’ to
the translations of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims by Professor
Legge, Mr. Beal, M. Abel Rémusat, and M. Stanislas Julien, to M. Huc’s
travels, and to Mr. Scott’s ‘Burman,’ will be evident, and have been
generally acknowledged in my notes. I am particularly grateful to Mr.
Sarat Chandra Das, C.I.E., for the information contained in his Report
and for the instruction which I received from him personally while
prosecuting my inquiries at Darjiling.

I have felt compelled to abbreviate nearly all my quotations, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> occasionally to alter the phraseology. Hence I have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to mark them by a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> type <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> inverted commas.

With regard to transliteration I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> refer the student to the rules for
pronunciation <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> at p. xxxi. They conform to the rules <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in my
Sansk?it Grammar and Dictionary. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> Dr. Oldenberg, I have preferred to
substitute Sansk?it terminations in _a_ for the Pali _o_. In Tibetan I
have constantly consulted Jäschke, but have not followed his system of
transliteration.

In conclusion, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> fitly draw attention to the engravings of objects,
some of which were <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by myself from Buddhist countries. They are
described in the list of illustrations (see p. xxix), and will, I trust,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> value to the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> volume. It has seemed to me a duty to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> use

difficult subject; and, as these Lectures embrace the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> range of
Buddhism, I have adopted as a frontispiece a portrait of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> which
exhibits Buddhism in its receptivity and in its readiness to adopt
serpent-worship, or any other superstition of the races which it strove
to convert. On the other hand, the Wheel, with the Tri-ratna and the
Lotus (pp. 521, 522), is engraved on the title-page as the best
representative symbol of early Buddhism. It is taken from a Buddhist
sculpture at Amaravati engraved for Mr. Fergusson’s ‘Tree and
Serpent-worship’ (p. 237).

The portrait which faces page 74 is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> worthy of attention as
illustrating the connexion[2] between Buddhism and Brahmanism. It is
from a recently-taken photograph of Mr. Gauri-?a?kar Uday-?a?kar,
C.S.I.—a well-known and distinguished <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> of Bhaunagar—who (with Mr.
Percival) administered the State during the minority of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span>
enlightened Maha-raja. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> of old, he has renounced the
world—that is, he has <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Sannyasi, and is chiefly engaged in
meditation. He has consequently dropped the title C.S.I., and taken the
religious title—Svami ?ri Saccidananda-Sarasvati. His son, Mr.
Vijay-?a?kar Gauri-?a?kar, kindly sent me the photograph, and with his
permission I have had it engraved.

It will be easily understood that, as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> portion of the following

repetitions and recapitulations were unavoidable, but I trust I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>
not be amenable to the charge of repeating anything for the sake of
‘padding.’ I shall, with more justice, be accused of ‘cramming,’ in the
<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of attempting to force too <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> information into a single volume.

                                                      _January 1, 1889._




                              POSTSCRIPT.


<span class="t6 hoverable">Since</span> writing the foregoing prefatory remarks, I have observed with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
concern that a prevalent error, in regard to Buddhism, is still
persistently propagated. It is categorically stated in a newspaper
report of a quite recent lecture, that out of the world’s population of
about 1500 millions at least 500 millions are Buddhists, and that
Buddhism numbers more adherents than any other religion on the surface
of the globe.

Almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> European writer on Buddhism, of late years, has assisted in
giving currency to this utterly erroneous calculation, and it is high
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that an attempt should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to dissipate a serious
misconception.

It is forgotten that mere sympathizers with Buddhism, who occasionally
conform to Buddhistic practices, are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists. In China the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of all Confucianists and then either Taoists or
Buddhists or both. In Japan Confucianism and Shintoism co-exist with
Buddhism. In some other Buddhist countries a kind of Shamanism is
practically dominant. The best authorities (including the Oxford
Professor of Chinese, as stated in the Introduction to his excellent
<span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> ‘The Travels of Fa-hien’) are of opinion that there are not more
than 100 millions of real Buddhists in the world, and that Christianity
with its 430 to 450 millions of adherents has now the numerical
preponderance over all other religions. I am entirely of the same
opinion. I hold that the Buddhism, described in the following pages,
contained <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> itself, from the earliest times, the germs of disease,
decay, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> (see p. 557), and that its <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> condition is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
rapidly increasing disintegration and decline.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not forget that Buddhism has disappeared from India proper,
although it dominates in Ceylon and Burma, and although a few Buddhist
travellers find their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its origin and sojourn
there.

Indeed, if I were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a rough comparative numerical
estimate of the six chief religious systems of the world, I should be
inclined, on the whole, to regard Confucianism as constituting, next to
Christianity, the most numerically prevalent creed. We have to bear in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> the immense populations, both in China and Japan, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> chief creed
is Confucianism.

Professor Legge informs me that Dr. Happer—an American Presbyterian
Missionary of about 45 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> standing, who has gone carefully into the
statistics of Buddhism—reckons only 20 millions of Buddhists in China,
and not more than 72½ millions in the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of Asia. Dr. Happer states
that, if the Chinese were required to class themselves as Confucianists
or Buddhists or Taoists, 19/20ths, if not 99/100ths, of them would, in
his opinion, claim to be designated as Confucianists.

In all probability his estimate of the number of Buddhists in China is
too low, but the Chinese ambassador Liu, with whom Professor Legge once
had a conversation on this subject, ridiculed the view that they were as
numerous as the Confucianists.

Confucianism should be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to Brahmanism and Hinduism, which are not
really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems but practically one; the latter being merely an
expansion of the former, modified by contact with Buddhism.

Brahmanism, as I have elsewhere shown, is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
Pantheism; that is, a belief in the universal diffusion of an impersonal
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> (called <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Brahma)—as the only really existing
Essence—and in its manifesting itself in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> and in countless material
forces and forms, including gods, demons, men, and animals, which, after
fulfilling their course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> ultimately be re-absorbed into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
impersonal Essence and be again evolved in endless evolution and
dissolution.

Hinduism, with its worship of Vish?u and ?iva, is based on this
pantheistic doctrine, but the majority of the Hindus are merely
observers of Brahmanical institutions with their accompanying Hindu
caste usages. If, however, we employ the term Hindu in its widest
acceptation (omitting only all Islamized Hindus) we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> safely affirm
that the adherents of Hinduism have reached an aggregate of nearly 200
millions. In the opinion of Sir William Wilson Hunter, they are still
rapidly increasing, both by excess of births over deaths and by
accretions from more backward systems of belief.

Probably Buddhism has a <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to the fourth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the scale of
numerical comparison. At any rate the number of Buddhists can scarcely
be calculated at less than 100 millions.

In regard to Muhammadanism, this creed should not, I think, be placed
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than fifth in the enumeration. In its purest <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> it ought to be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Islam, and in that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> it is a mere distorted copy of Judaism.

The Empress of India, as is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> known, rules over more Muhammadans than
any other potentate in the world. Probably the Musalman population of
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of India now numbers 55 millions.

As to the number of Muhammadans in the Turkish empire, there are no very
trustworthy data to guide us, but the aggregate is believed to be about
14 millions; while Africa can scarcely reckon more than that number,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if Egypt be included.

The sixth system, Taoism (the system of Lao-tsze), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
Professor Legge, should rank numerically after both Muhammadanism and
Buddhism.

Of course Jainism (p. 529) and Zoroastrianism (the religion of the
Parsis) are too numerically insignificant to occupy places in the above
comparison.

It is possible that a careful census <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> result in a more favourable
estimate of the number of Buddhists in the world, than I have here
submitted; but at all events it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> safely be alleged that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as a
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of popular religion, Buddhism is gradually losing its
vitality—gradually loosening its hold on the vast populations once loyal
to its rule; nay, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is rapidly approaching when its capacity

                               BUDDHISM.




                               LECTURE I.
          _Introductory. Buddhism in relation to Brahmanism._


In my recent work[3] on Brahmanism I have traced the progress of Indian
religious <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> successive stages—called by me Vedism,
Brahmanism, and Hinduism—the last including the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> subdivisions of
?aivism, Vaish?avism, and ?aktism. Furthermore I have attempted to prove
that these systems are not really separated by sharp lines, but that
each almost imperceptibly shades off into the other.

I have striven <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to show that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Hindu of the orthodox school is
able quite conscientiously to accept all these developments of religious
belief. He holds that they have their authoritative exponents in the
successive bibles of the Hindu religion, namely, (1) the four
Vedas—?ig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sama-veda, Atharva-veda—and the Brahma?as;
(2) the Upanishads; (3) the Law-books—especially that of Manu; (4) the
Bhakti-?astras, including the Ramaya?a, the Maha-bharata, the
Pura?as—especially the Bhagavata-pura?a—and the Bhagavad-gita; (5) the
Tantras.

The chief <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> under these five heads represent the principal periods
of religious development through which the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> has passed.

Thus, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, the hymns of the Vedas and the ritualism of
the Brahma?as represent physiolatry or the worship of the personified
forces of nature—a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of religion which ultimately became saturated
with sacrificial ideas and with ceremonialism and asceticism. Secondly,
the Upanishads represent the pantheistic conceptions which terminated in
philosophical Brahmanism. Thirdly, the Law-books represent caste-rules
and domestic usages. Fourthly, the Ramaya?a, Maha-bharata, and Pura?as
represent the principle of personal devotion to the personal gods, ?iva,
Vish?u, and their manifestations; and fifthly, the Tantras represent the
perversion of the principle of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> to polluting and degrading practices
disguised under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of religious rites. Of these five phases of the
Hindu religion probably the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> only prevailed when Buddhism
arose; but I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> try to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> clear hereafter that Buddhism, as it
developed, accommodated itself to the fourth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> ultimately to the
fifth phase, admitting the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> into its own creed, while Hinduism
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> received ideas from Buddhism.

At any rate it is clear that the so-called orthodox <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> admits all
five series of <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> as progressive exponents of the Hindu
system—although he scarcely likes to confess openly to any adoption of
the fifth. Hence his opinions are of necessity Protean and multiform.

The root ideas of his creed are of course Pantheistic, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
being grounded on the identification of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> external world—which
he believes to be a mere illusory appearance—with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> eternal,
impersonal, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Essence; but his religion is capable of presenting
so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> phases, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the stand-point from which it is viewed,
that its pantheism appears to be continually sliding into forms of
monotheism and polytheism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> into the lowest types of animism and
fetishism.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not, moreover, forget—as I have pointed out in my recent
work—that a large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Hindus are unorthodox in respect of their
interpretation of the leading doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahmanism.

Such unorthodox persons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be described as sectarians or dissenters.
That is to say, they dissent from the orthodox pantheistic doctrine that
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and men, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> souls, and all material

supreme personal god—either ?iva or Vish?u or K?ish?a or Rama—who is not
liable (as orthodox Brahmans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> he is) to lose his personality by
subjection to the universal <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of dissolution and re-absorption into

to the bliss of which his worshippers are admitted[4].

And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that these sectarians are very <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from
resting their belief on the Vedas, the Brahma?as, and Upanishads.

Their creed is based entirely on the Bhakti-?astras—that is, on the
Ramaya?a, Maha-bharata, and Pura?as (especially on the Bhagavata-pura?a)
and the Bhagavad-gita, to the exclusion of the other scriptures of
Hinduism.

Then again it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> always be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that the terms ‘orthodox’ and
‘unorthodox’ have really little or no application to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority
of the inhabitants of India, who in <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> are wholly innocent of any
theological opinions at all, and are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> too apathetic to trouble
themselves about any <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of religion other than that which has belonged
for centuries to their families and to the localities in which they
live, and <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> too ignorant and dull of intellect to be capable of
inquiring for themselves whether that religion is likely to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> or

Their faculties are so enfeebled by the debilitating effect of early
marriages, and so deadened by the drudgery of daily toil and the dire
necessity of keeping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> together, that they can scarcely be

Hindu consists in observing caste-customs, local usages, and family
observances, in holding what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Folk-legends of his

and superscription of the Empress of India, impressed on the current
coin of the country.

As a rule such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> gives himself no uneasiness whatever about his

He is quite content to commit his interests in a future <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to the care

What he really troubles himself about is the necessity for securing the
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> favour of the inhabitants of the unseen world, supposed to
occupy the atmosphere everywhere around him—of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons

alleged forms of Vish?u or ?iva.

It follows that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the ordinary Hindu, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> indifferent about

to swarm with spirits, who unless duly propitiated will blight the

Then again, besides the orthodox and besides the sectarian Hindu and
besides the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> demon-worshipping, idolatrous, and superstitious

account—the class of rationalists and free-thinkers. These have been
common in India from the earliest times.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> a class of conscientious doubters, who strove to solve the
riddle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by microscopic self-introspection and sincere searchings
after truth, and these did their best not to break with the Veda, Vedic
revelation, and the authority of the Brahmans.

Earnestly and reverently such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> applied themselves to the difficult
task of trying to answer such questions as—What am I? Whence have I
come? Whither am I going? How can I explain my consciousness of personal
existence? Have I an immaterial <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> distinct from, and independent
of, my material frame? Of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in which I find
myself? Did an all-powerful Being create it out of nothing? or did it
evolve itself out of an eternal protoplasmic germ? or did it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>
<span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> by the combination of eternal atoms? or is it a mere illusion?
If created by a Being of infinite wisdom and love, how can I <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for
the co-existence in it of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, happiness and misery? Has the
Creator form, or is He formless? Has He qualities and affections, or has
He none?

It was in the effort to solve such insoluble enigmas by their own
unaided intuitions and in a manner not too subversive of traditional
dogma, that the systems of philosophy founded on the Upanishads
originated.

These have been described in my <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> on Brahmanism. They were gradually
excogitated by independent thinkers, who claimed to be Brahmans or
twice-born men, and nominally accepted the Veda with its Brahma?as,
while they covertly attacked it, or at least abstained from denouncing
it as absolutely untrue. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> tacitly submitted to sacerdotal
authority, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they really propounded a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of salvation based
entirely on self-evolved knowledge, and quite independent of all Vedic
sacrifices and sacrificing priests. The most noteworthy and orthodox of
the systems propounded by them was the Vedanta[5], which, as I have
shown, was simply <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Pantheism, and asserted that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
was the only real Being in the Universe.

But the origin of the more unorthodox systems, which denied the
authority of both the Veda and the Brahmans, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be traced to the
influence of the Upanishads. For it is undeniable that a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
atheistic infidelity grew up in India almost _pari passu_ with dogmatic
Brahmanism, and has always been prevalent there. In fact it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
easy to show that periodical outbursts of unbelief and agnosticism have
taken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in India very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as in Europe; but the
tendency to run into extremes has always been greater on Indian soil and
beneath the glow and glamour of Eastern skies. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side, a <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
more unthinking respect than in any other country has been paid to the
authority of priests, who have declared their supernatural revelation to
be the very breath of God, sacrificial rites to be the sole instruments
of salvation, and themselves the sole mediators between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and
heaven; on the other, <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> greater latitude than in any other country has
been conceded to infidels and atheists who have poured contempt on all
sacerdotal dogmas, have denied all supernatural revelation, have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> no
secret of their disbelief in a personal God, and have maintained that

We learn <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> from <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> passages of the Veda (?ig-veda II. 12. 5;
VIII. 100. 3, 4) that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the Vedic age some denied the existence of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Indra.

We know, too, that Yaska, the well-known Vedic commentator, who is
believed to have lived before the grammarian Pa?ini (probably in the
fourth century B.C.), <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> himself obliged to refute the sceptical
arguments of Kautsa and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> who pronounced the Veda a tissue of
nonsense (Nirukta I. 15, 16).

Again, Manu—whose law-book, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Dr. Bühler, was composed
between the second century B.C. and the second A.D., and, in my opinion,
possibly earlier—has the following remark directed against sceptics:—

‘The twice-born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who depending on rationalistic treatises
(hetu-?astra) contemns the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> roots of <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> (?ruti and sm?iti), is to be
excommunicated (vahish-karya?) by the righteous as an atheist (nastika)
and despiser of the Veda’ (Manu II. 11).

Furthermore, the Maha-bharata, a poem which contains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> ancient
legends quite as ancient as those of early Buddhism, relates
(?anti-parvan 1410, etc.) the story of the infidel Carvaka, who in the
disguise of a mendicant <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> uttered sentiments dangerously
heretical.

This Carvaka was the supposed founder of a materialistic school of
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lokayata. Rejecting all instruments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(prama?a) except perception by the senses (pratyaksha), he affirmed that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> did not exist separately from the body, and that all the
phenomena of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> were spontaneously produced.

  And jabber of the priests is simple nonsense.

Then again, the continued prevalence of sceptical opinions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be shown
by extracts from other portions of the later literature. For example, in
the Ramaya?a (II. 108) the infidel <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> Javali gives utterance to
similar sentiments thus:—

‘The books composed by theologians, in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are enjoined to

perceptible by the senses (pratyaksham). Cast everything beyond this
behind your back.’

Furthermore, in a parallel passage from the Vish?u-pura?a, it is
declared that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Deceiver, practising illusion, beguiled other

Such extracts prove that the worst forms of scepticism prevailed in both

<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> were not equally offensive, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> certainly be unfair and

reckless Pyrrhonism of the Carvakas who had no code of morality.

And <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it was for this very reason, that when Buddhism and Jainism
began to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> their presence felt in the fifth century B.C. they became
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more formidable than any other phase of scepticism.

Whether, however, Buddhism or Jainism be entitled to chronological
precedence is still an open question, about which opinions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
reasonably differ. Some hold that they were always quite distinct from
each other, and were the products of inquiry originated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

itself by <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> the more important position of the two. For although
Jainism has shown more tenacity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in India, and has lingered on

It is to be hoped that the annexation of Upper Burma, while giving an

<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> moment claims a vast number of adherents in Asia, and not a few
sympathisers in Europe and America.

Evidently, then, any Orientalist who undertakes to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a clear and
concise <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of Buddhism in the compass of a few lectures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> find
himself engaged in a very venturesome and difficult task.

Happily we are gaining acquaintance with the Southern or purest <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism through editions and translations of the texts of the Pali
Canon by Fausböll, Childers, Rhys Davids, Oldenberg, Morris, Trenckner,
L. Feer, etc. We owe much, too, to the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of Turnour, Hardy, Clough,
Gogerly, D’Alwis, Burnouf, Lassen, Spiegel, Weber, Koeppen, Minayeff,
Bigandet, Max Müller, Kern, Ed. Müller, E. Kuhn, Pischel, and others.
These enable us to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> a fair estimate of what Buddhism was in its
early days.

But the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> is <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> when we turn to the Northern Buddhist
Scriptures, written generally in tolerably correct Sansk?it (with
Tibetan translations). These continue to be little studied,
notwithstanding the materials placed at our command and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
done, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> by the distinguished ‘founder of the study of Buddhism,’
Brian Hodgson, and by Burnouf, Wassiljew, Cowell, Senart, Kern, Beal,
Foucaux, and others. In fact, the moment we <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> from the Buddhism of
India, Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, to that of Nepal, Kashmir, Tibet,
Bhutan, Sikkim, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Corea, and Japan, we seem to
have entered a labyrinth, the clue of which is continually slipping from
our hands.

Nor is it possible to classify the varying and often conflicting systems
in these latter countries, under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> general title of Northern
Buddhism.

For <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> the changes which religious systems undergo, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in
countries adjacent to each other, not unfrequently amount to an entire
reversal of their <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> character. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> illustrate these changes by
the variations of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> derived from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same root in
neighbouring countries. Take, for example, the German <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> selig,
‘blessed,’ and knabe, ‘a boy,’ which in England are represented by
‘silly’ and ‘knave.’

A similar <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> appears to hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of religious ideas. Their
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> character seems to change by a change of latitude and longitude.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of Christianity. Can it be maintained, for instance,
that the Christianity of modern Greece and Rome has <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in common with
early Christianity, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> any casual observer believe that the
inhabitants of St. Petersburg, Berlin, Edinburgh, London, and Paris were
followers of the same religion?

It <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> surprise us if Buddhism developed into apparently
contradictory systems in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> countries and under varying climatic
conditions. In no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> countries did it preserve the same features. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
in India, the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its birth, it had greatly changed during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
ten centuries of its prevalence. So <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> so that had it been possible
for its founder to reappear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the fifth century after
Christ, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have failed to recognize his own child, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
<span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that his own teaching had not escaped the operation of a <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> which
experience proves to be universal and inevitable.

It is easy, therefore, to understand how difficult it will be to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>
any semblance of unity to my <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> subject. It will be impossible for
me to treat as a consistent <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> a system having a perpetually varying
front and no settled form. I can only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a series of somewhat rough,
though, I hope, trustworthy outlines, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as possible in methodical
succession.

And in the carrying out of such a design, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> objects that will at

constitute the well-known triad of early Buddhism—that is to say, the

Hence my aim will be, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> such a historical
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and of his earliest teaching as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be gathered
from his legendary biography, and from the most trustworthy parts of the

description of the origin and composition of those scriptures as
containing the Buddha’s ‘Law’ (Dharma); and thirdly, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> endeavour
to explain the early constitution of the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks
(Sa?gha). After treating of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> preliminary topics, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> next
describe the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> itself; that is, the philosophical doctrines of
Buddhism, its code of morality and theory of perfection, terminating in
Nirva?a. Lastly, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> attempt to trace out the confused outlines of
theistic, mystical, and hierarchical Buddhism, as developed in Northern
countries, adding an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of sacred objects and places, and
contrasting the chief doctrines of Christianity. In regard to the
Buddhism of Tibet, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> chiefly base my explanations on Koeppen’s

India bordering on that country.

And here I ought to state that my explanations and descriptions will, I
fear, be wholly deficient in picturesqueness. My simple aim will be to
convey clear and correct information in unembellished language; and in
doing this, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> often be compelled to expose myself to the reproach
contained in the expressions, _carvita-carva?am_, ‘chewing the chewed,’

To begin, then, with the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself.




                              LECTURE II.
                  _The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as a personal Teacher._


It is <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to be regretted that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all the sacred books that

Canon of Buddhism—there is no trustworthy biography of its Founder.

For Buddhism is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> Buddha, just as Zoroastrianism is

Indeed, no religion or religious system which has not emanated from some

In all likelihood legendary histories of the Founder of Buddhism were
current in Nepal and Tibet in the early centuries of our era; but
unhappily his too enthusiastic and imaginative admirers have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to testify their admiration by interweaving with the probable
facts of Gautama Buddha’s life, fables so extravagant that some modern
critical scholars have despaired of attempting to sift <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> from
fiction, and have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> gone to the extreme of doubting that Gautama
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> ever lived at all.

To believe <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> that has been recorded about him, is as unreasonable
as to accept with unquestioning faith all the miraculous circumstances
which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to encircle him as with a halo of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glory.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that when Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> lived—about the fifth

Greece (witness, for example, the familiar instance of Socrates)—men
have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> more of preserving the sayings of their teachers than of
recording the facts of their lives.

And we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not forget that in India—where the imaginative faculties
have always been too active, and anything <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> real history is

Hence it has happened that the ballads (gatha) and legends current about
Gautama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Northern Buddhists, bristle with the wildest fancies and
the most absurd exaggerations.

Buddha’s life, we begin by asserting that intense individuality, fervid

beauty of countenance, calm dignity of bearing, and above all, almost
superhuman persuasiveness of speech, were conspicuous in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

The earliest authorities, however, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> claim for him anything
extraordinary or superhuman in regard to external form. It was only in
later times that Buddhist writers pandered to the superstitions of the
people, by describing the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as possessed of various miraculous
characteristics of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and body.

Unhappily, no authoritative Buddhist scripture gives any trustworthy

Bhuila)—a town situated about half-way between Basti and Ajudhya
(Ayodhya) in the territory of Kosala (the modern Oudh, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> pp. 29, 48),

His father, named ?uddhodana, was a land-owner of the tribe of the

prefer to use the titles rather than the personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Gautama, which is
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> too familiar.

The names of previous Buddhas, supposed to have existed in previous
ages, are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> at p. 136.

Little of the story of the miraculous birth of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is worthy of
repetition. Since, however, a white elephant is reckoned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the
sacred objects of Buddhism, as something rare and precious, it is worth
while mentioning the fable, that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> for the Bodhi-sattva
to leave the Tushita <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (p. 120) and be born on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as Gautama
Buddha, he descended into the womb of his mother in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of a white
elephant. He was born under a ?al tree and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma received him
from his mother’s side. His mother, Maya, died seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> afterwards,
and the infant was committed to her sister (Maha-prajapati), a second
wife of ?uddhodana.

It is not related of Gautama that, as he grew up, any efforts were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
to imbue him with sacred learning; though, as a Kshatriya, he was
privileged to receive instruction in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> portions of the Veda.

Nor are we told of him that as a Kshatriya he was trained to the
profession of a soldier. It is more probable, that his <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of
contemplation developed itself very early, and that from a desire to
humour this not uncommon Oriental propensity, he was allowed to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span>
most of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in the open air.

There is a well-known legend, which relates how Gautama’s relations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>

seventeen, without, so to speak, tarnishing the family escutcheon, and

neighbourhood of his father’s city, desiring to examine the beautiful
trees and flowers.

Then there appeared before his eyes in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the streets the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of a
decrepid[**decrepit] <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> man, his skin shrivelled, his head bald, his
teeth gone, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> infirm and bent. A staff supported his tottering
limbs, as he stood <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> across the path of the prince’s advancing
chariot.

Seeing this aged person, Siddhartha inquired of his charioteer:—‘What
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> is this, so miserable and so distressing, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> of which I
have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> seen before?’

The charioteer replied:—‘This is what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> man.’

The prince again inquired:—‘And what is the exact <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of this
expression “old”?’

The charioteer answered:—‘Old age implies the loss of bodily power,
decay of the vital functions, and failure of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and memory. This poor

Then asked the prince:—‘Is this <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> universal?’

‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘this is the common lot of all living creatures. All
that is born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> die.’

Soon afterwards <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> strange sight presented itself—a sick man, worn
by disease and suffering, pale and miserable, scarcely able to draw his
breath, was seen tottering on the road.

Then the prince inquired of his charioteer:—‘Who is this unhappy being?’

The charioteer replied:—‘This is a sick man, and such sickness is common
to all.’

Soon afterwards there passed before them a corpse, borne on a bier.

Then asked the prince:—‘Who is this borne onwards on his bed, covered
with strangely-coloured garments, surrounded by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> weeping and

‘This,’ replied the charioteer, ‘is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a dead body; he has ended his

shoulder bare, a religious staff in his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> hand, and a mendicant’s
alms-bowl in his left.

‘Who is this,’ the prince inquired, ‘proceeding with slow and dignified
steps, looking <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> to the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> nor to the left, absorbed in
thought, with shaven head and garments of reddish colour?’

‘This man,’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the charioteer, ‘devotes himself to charity, and
restrains his appetites and his bodily desires. He hurts nobody, but
does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to all, and is full of sympathy for all.’

Then the prince asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of his own
condition.

He answered:—‘I am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a homeless ascetic; I have forsaken the world,
relatives, and friends; I seek deliverance for myself and desire the
salvation of all creatures, and I do harm to none.’

After hearing these words, the prince <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to his <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and said, ‘I
wish to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a wandering ascetic (parivrajika) and to seek Nirvana;
all worldly things, O king! are changeable and transitory.’

Such is an epitome of the legendary story of the ‘four visionary
appearances,’ so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> because they are supposed to have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

abridged form.

Very shortly after the occurrences just described, Gautama receives
<span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the birth of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Rahula.

thought. He sees in his child the strongest of all fetters, binding him
to family and home. But his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up.

for ever held in bondage. Around him gather the beautiful women of his
father’s household, striving by their blandishments to divert him from
his purpose; but in vain. He seeks the chamber of his wife, and finds
her asleep with her <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> on the head of his infant son. He longs for a
last embrace; but fearing to arouse her suspicions hurries away.
Outside, his favourite horse is waiting to aid his flight. He
accomplishes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage of what Buddhists call with pride the
Mahabhinishkrama?a, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> going <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from home;’ but not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
overcoming other still more formidable trials. For Mara, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> deity

visible, and promises the prince all the glories of empire if he will
return to the pleasures of worldly life.

Finding all his allurements disregarded, Mara alters his method of
attack; he fills the air with mighty thunderings, and creates on the
road before the youthful fugitive’s eyes apparitions of torrents, lofty
mountains, and blazing conflagrations. But <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> alarms or deters him.
‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rather,’ he exclaims, ‘be torn to pieces limb by limb, or be

Arrived at a safe distance from his father’s territory, he exchanges
garments with a passing beggar, cuts off his own hair with a sword, and
assumes the outward aspect and character of a wandering ascetic. The
hair does not fall to the ground but is taken up to the Trayastri??as

There he attaches himself as a disciple to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in India abounds in more interesting Buddhistic remains than
Raja-g?iha (about 40 miles south-east of Patna), proving that it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of the most sacred places of Buddhism, consecrated by some of its most
cherished associations. Its Pali <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is Raja-gaha.

conjectured that the connexion between the metaphysics of Buddhism and
those of Brahmanism was due to Gautama’s intercourse with the Brahmans
of this district, and to the ideas he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> imbibed at the earliest stage
of his career.

But to resume our story. Gautama fails to find in Brahmanical philosophy
that rest and peace for which his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was craving when he left his
home.

Still there was <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of emancipation and union with the Universal
Soul, taught by the Brahmans. This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of Tapas[11], or
self-inflicted bodily pain and austerity.

From the earliest times a favourite doctrine of Brahmanism has been,
that self-inflicted bodily suffering is before all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> efficacious
for the accumulation of religious merit, for the acquirement of
supernatural powers, and for the spirit’s release from the bondage of
transmigration and its re-absorption into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Universal Spirit.

described as mortifying themselves by bodily austerities (_tapas_), so
as not to be outdone by men; for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the theory of Hinduism,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> themselves <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be supplanted and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> ousted from their rank

devotees through a protracted endurance of severe bodily suffering.

Hence we are not surprised to find it recorded of Gautama Buddha, that
seeking in vain for rest in the teaching of Brahmanical philosophy, and
eager to try the effect of a course of self-mortification, he wandered
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from Raja-g?iha to a wood in the district of Gaya, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Uruvilva
(or Uruvela).

There, in company with five other ascetics, he began his celebrated
sexennial fast. Sitting down with his legs folded under him on a raised
seat in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> unsheltered from sun, wind, rain, dew, and cold, he
gradually reduced his daily allowance of food to a single grain of rice.
Then holding his breath, he harassed and macerated his body, but all in
vain. No peace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> came, and no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> enlightenment. He became
convinced of his own folly in resorting to bodily austerity as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
of attaining supreme enlightenment, and delivering himself from the
evils and sufferings of life.

Rousing himself, as if from a troubled dream, he took food and
nourishment in a natural way, thereby incurring the temporary
disapproval of his five companions in self-mortification. Then, when
sufficiently refreshed, he moved <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> spot in the same
district. There, under the shelter of a sacred fig-tree (A?vattha,
_Ficus religiosa_, <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as the Pippala or Pipal), in a village,
afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Buddha-Gaya, he gave himself up to <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>
forms of meditation (Jhana = Dhyana). In this he merely conformed to the
Hindu Yoga,—a method of attaining mystic union with the Deity, which
although not then formulated into a system, was already in vogue <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>
the Brahmans. There can be little doubt that the Dhara?a, Dhyana (see p.
209), and Samadhi of the Yoga were resorted to, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in Gautama’s time,
as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> for the attainment of perfect <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> illumination, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
as of final absorption in the Deity.

In Manu VI. 72 it is said:—‘Let him purge himself from all taints
(doshan) by suppression of breath, from sin by restraints of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span>

qualities by meditation (dhyanena).’

declared:—‘holding his body, head, and neck quite immovable, seated on a
firm seat in a pure spot with Ku?a grass around, the devotee (Yogi)
should look only at the tip of his nose, and should meditate on the
Supreme Being’ (VI. 11, 12). Further on he is directed to meditate so
profoundly as to think about <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> whatever (VI. 25).

The very Gayatri or ancient Vedic prayer (?ig-veda III. 62. 10, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p.
78 of this volume)—which is to Hindus what the Lord’s Prayer is to
Christians, and is still repeated by millions of our Indian
fellow-subjects at their daily devotions—was originally an act of
meditation, performed with the very object Gautama had in view—supreme
enlightenment of mind:—‘Let us meditate (Dhimahi, root _dhyai_) on the
excellent glory of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vivifying Sun, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> he enlighten our

in keeping with Brahmanical ideas (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p.
335).

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> result, however, of his engaging in abstract meditation, was
that he seemed to himself to be as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as ever from the emancipation
which was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> aim of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> renunciation. Why not then return to
the world? Why not indulge again in the pleasures of sense? Why not go
back to home, wife, and child? Thoughts of this kind passed through his
mind, while all his <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> affections and feelings seemed to revive with
tenfold intensity. Then on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> particular night, during this mental
struggle, Mara, the Destroyer and personification of carnal desire,
seized his opportunity. The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> had bided his time; had
waited to assail the sage at the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> moment, when protracted
self-mortification had done its work—when with exhausted strength he had
little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of resistance.

It is certainly remarkable that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> struggle between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil,

notable allusion to this in ?a?kara’s Commentary to Chandogya Upanishad,

The legendary description of the Buddha’s temptation, and of the assault
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him by Mara (the deadly <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of sensuous desire[13]), and by
all his troop of attendants, is so interesting and curious,
notwithstanding its extravagance, that I here abridge it:—

Fiends and demons swarmed about him in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of awful monsters,
furies, vampires, hobgoblins, armed to the teeth with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> implement of
destruction. Their million faces were frightful to behold, their limbs
encircled by myriads of serpents, their heads enveloped in a blaze of
fire. They surrounded the saint and assailed him in a thousand <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span>
ways. Missiles of all kinds were hurled against him; poison and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
were showered over him—but the poison changed into flowers, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>
formed a halo round his head.

The baffled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> now shifted his ground. He summoned his sixteen
enchanting daughters, and sent them to display their charms in the
presence of the youthful saint. But the resolute young ascetic was not
to be lured by their wiles. He remained calm and impassive, and with a
stern face rebuked the maidens for their boldness, forcing them to
retire discomfited and disgraced.

Other forms of temptation followed, and the debilitated ascetic’s
strength seemed to be giving way. But this was merely the crisis. After
rising to <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> stages of abstract meditation at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of
a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> night he shook off his foe. The victory was won, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his mind. A legend relates that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
night-watch he gained a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all his previous existences; in the
second—of all <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> states of being; in the third—of the chain of
causes and effects (p. 102); and at the dawn of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he knew all things.

The dawn on which this remarkable struggle terminated was the birthday
of Buddhism. Gautama was at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> about thirty-five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age. It
was then, and not till then, that his Bodhi-sattvaship (see p. 135)
ended and he gained a <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to the title Buddha, ‘the Enlightened.’ No
wonder that the tree under which he sat became celebrated as ‘the tree
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and enlightenment.’ It is remarkable, too, that just as the
night on which the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> attained perfect enlightenment is the most
sacred night with Buddhists, so the Bodhi-tree (in familiar language,
Bo-tree) is their most sacred symbol—a symbol as dear to Buddhists as
the Cross is to Christians.

And what was this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge, evolved out of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> sublimated by
intense meditation?

This is, perhaps, the strangest point of all in this strange story. It
was after all a mere partial one-sided truth—the outcome of a single
line of thought, dwelt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> with morbid intensity, to the exclusion of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other line of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> which <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have modified and balanced it.
It was an ultra-pessimistic view of the miseries of life, and a
determination to ignore all its counterbalancing joys. It was the
doctrine that this <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> link in a chain of countless
transmigrations—that existence of all kinds involves suffering, and that
such suffering can only be got rid of by self-restraint and the
extinction of desires, especially of the desire for continuity of
personal existence.

For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> it be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> clear at the outset, that whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of the
Christian-like self-renunciation enjoined by the Buddhist code of
morality, the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> it aims at renouncing is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> of
personality, and the chief self-love it deprecates is the self-love
which consists in craving for continuous <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> life.

To those who have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> travelled or resided <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in the East,
indulgence in such a morbid <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of pessimism, under glowing skies and

pessimistic theories of existence on their fellow-men, are not uncommon.

In the course of my travels I frequently met ascetics who had <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> up
family and friends, and were leading a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of morose seclusion, and
pretended meditation, undergoing <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> courses of bodily mortification.
Nay, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who, to prove their utter contempt for the
pleasures of worldly existence, and to render themselves fit for the
extinction of all personality by absorption into the Universal Soul,
have sat in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> posture, or held up <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> arm for years, or allowed
themselves no bed but a bed of spikes, no shelter but the foliage of

<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> peculiar or original.

Nor need we doubt that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> historical facts underlie the legendary
narrative. We <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> admit with the learned Senart and Kern that the

The Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> exclamations, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of his
subsequent sayings and doings, are the more worthy of credit as taken
from the Southern Canon.

The Maha-vagga (I. 1) tells us that after attaining complete
intelligence, the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> sat cross-legged on the ground under the
Bodhi-tree for seven days, absorbed in meditation and enjoying the bliss
of enlightenment. At the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of that period, during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
watches of the night, he fixed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> on the causes of existence. Then
having <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> out the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of causation (p. 102), he exclaimed: ‘When
the laws of being <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> manifest to the earnest thinker, his doubts
vanish, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the Sun, he dispels the hosts of Mara.’

Next he meditated for <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> under a banyan tree, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
tree of goat-herds (aja-pala). It was there that a haughty <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
accosted him with the question, ‘Who is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Brahman?’ and was told,
‘One free from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and pride; self-restrained, learned, and pure.’

Then he meditated under <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> tree for a third period of seven days.
There the serpent (Naga) Mucalinda (or Mucilinda) coiled his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> round
the Buddha, and formed a canopy to protect him from the raging of a
storm—this being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the trials he had to go through. When it was
over the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> exclaimed, ‘Happy is the seclusion of the satisfied <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
(tush?a) who has learned and seen the truth.’

A fourth period of meditation was passed under the tree Rajayatana,
making four times seven days. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> not these symbolize the four stages of

named Tapussa (Trapusha) and Bhallika. These became his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and for his doctrine (the Sa?gha not being then instituted,
Maha-v° I. 4. 5). A later legend relates that they received in return
eight of his hairs which they preserved as relics.

In connexion with the legend of a forty-nine days’ fast, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mention

forty-nine portions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> for each day.

With these legends we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> contrast the simple Gospel narrative of

more lives to lead, no more misery to undergo. In short he had achieved
the summum bonum of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists—the extinction of the fires of

feelings, the utter apathy and indifference to which his own doctrines
logically led (p. 128).

But he did not carry out his benevolent design <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> going through

The five ascetics (Kau??inya = Ko??añño, A?vajit = Assaji, Vashpa,
Mahanama, and Bhadrika) were soon converted by his words, and by merely
repeating the triple formula were admitted at once to his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of

five would-be members of his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of monks:—

‘There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremes (anta), O monks (Bhikkhus), to be avoided by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
who has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> up the world—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> devoted to sensual pleasures (kama),
which is degrading, common, vulgar, ignoble, profitless; and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to self-mortification (atma-klamatha)—painful, ignoble,
profitless. There is a middle path, avoiding both extremes—the noble
eightfold path discovered by the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (Tathagata)—which leads to
insight, to wisdom, to quietude (upa?ama), to knowledge, to perfect
enlightenment (sambodhi), to final extinction of desire and suffering
(Nirva?a).’

So <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> there is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> very explicit in the discourse. Doubtless such
precepts as ‘virtue is a mean’ and that ‘medio tutissimus ibis’ are
useful, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> trite, truths; but the difficulty is to prove that the
Buddha’s eightfold path is really a middle course of the kind described;
for the most fanatical enthusiasts will always regard their own creed,
<span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> extravagant, as moderate.

The Buddha, therefore, goes on to propound what he calls the four noble
truths (ariya-saccani = arya-satyani), which are the key to his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
doctrine. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be stated thus:—

1. All existence—that is, existence in any form, whether on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in
heavenly spheres—necessarily involves pain and suffering (dukkha). 2.
All suffering is caused by lust (raga) or craving or desire (ta?ha =
trish?a, ‘thirst’) of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> kinds—for sensual pleasure (kama), for
wealth (vibhava), and for existence (bhava). 3. Cessation of suffering
is simultaneous with extinction of lust, craving, and desire (p. 139).
4. Extinction of lust, craving, and desire, and cessation of suffering
are accomplished by perseverance in the noble eightfold path (ariyo
a??hangiko maggo), viz. <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> belief or views (samma di??hi), <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
resolve (sa?kappo), <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> speech, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (kammanto), <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>

mindfulness (sati, p. 50), <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> mental concentration (samadhi).

And how is all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> mere suffering (I.6.19)?—

  ‘Birth is suffering. Decay is suffering. Illness is suffering. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span>
  is suffering. Association with (samprayogo) objects we hate is
  suffering. Separation from objects we <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> is suffering. Not to obtain
  what we desire is suffering. Clinging (upadana) to the five elements
  (p. 109) of existence is suffering. Complete cessation of thirst
  (ta?ha) and desires is cessation of suffering. This is the noble <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span>
  of suffering.’

Of course the real significance of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> sermon depends on the
interpretation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘right’ (samma = samyak) in describing the

believing in the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and his doctrine; ‘right resolve’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
abandoning one’s wife and family as the best method of extinguishing the
fires of the passions; <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> speech is recitation of the Buddha’s
doctrine; <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (Karmanta) is that of a monk; <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> livelihood is

trance-like quietude.

Mark, too, that in describing the misery of life, association with loved
objects is not mentioned as compensating for the pain of connexion with
hateful objects.

The Buddha’s early disciples were not poor men; for the sixth to be
admitted to the Sa?gha was a high-born youth named Yasa. Then this
youth’s father, a rich merchant, became the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> lay-disciple by
repeating the _triple_ formula (pp. 40, 78), and his mother and wife
became the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> lay-sisters. Next, four high-born friends of Yasa, and
subsequently fifty more became monks. Thus, not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
sermon, Gautama had sixty enrolled monks; all from the upper classes.

In sending <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> these sixty monks to proclaim his own gospel of
deliverance, he addressed them thus:—

‘I am delivered from all fetters (p. 127), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> and divine. You too, O

Go
forth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> by one, in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> directions. Preach the doctrine

preach this doctrine’ (Maha-vagga I. 11. 1).

When his monk-missionaries had departed, Gautama himself followed,

journeyed back to Uruvela, near Gaya. There he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> converted thirty

and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> brothers, who maintained a sacred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (‘Brahmanism,’ p.
364). The fire-chamber was haunted by a fiery snake-demon; so <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
asked to occupy the room for a night, fought the serpent and confined
him in his own alms-bowl. Next he worked other miracles (said to have
been 3500 in number), such as causing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> to recede, fire-wood to
split, fire-vessels to appear at his word. Then Ka?yapa and his
brothers, convinced of his miraculous powers, were admitted with the
other Brahmans to the Sa?gha. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> gathered round him about a
thousand monks.

To them on a hill Gayasisa (Brahma-yoni), near Gaya, he preached his
‘burning’ fire-sermon (Maha-v° I. 21): ‘Everything, O monks, is burning
(adittam = adiptam). The eye is burning; visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are burning. The
sensation produced by contact with visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is burning—burning

mohaggina), with birth, decay (jaraya), death, grief, lamentation, pain,
dejection (domanassehi), and despair (upayasehi). The ear is burning,
sounds are burning; the nose is burning, odours are burning; the tongue
is burning, tastes are burning; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is burning, objects of <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span>

noble disciple becomes weary of (or disgusted with) the eye, weary of
visible things, weary of the ear, weary of sounds, weary of odours,
weary of tastes, weary of the body, weary of the mind. Becoming weary,
he frees himself from passions and lusts. When free, he realizes that
his object is accomplished, that he has lived a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of restraint and
chastity (brahma-cariyam), that re-birth is ended.’

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that this fire-sermon—which is a key to the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of
Nirva?a—was suggested by the sight of a conflagration. It was Gautama’s
custom to impress ideas on his hearers by pointing to visible objects.
He compares all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to a flame; and the gist of the discourse is the
duty of extinguishing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of lusts, and with it the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of all
existence, and the importance of monkhood and celibacy for the
attainment of this end.

Contrast in Christ’s Sermon on the Mount the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> addressed to the

The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and his followers next proceeded to Raja-g?iha. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> them

(Maha-?ravakas); the chief of these being Ka?yapa (or Maha-ka?yapa),

(Agra-?ravikas) named Khema and Uppala-va??a (Utpala-var?a) were added
(see p. 86). Each leading disciple was afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sthavira, ‘an

(Pasenadi), <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Kosala, were Gautama’s lay-disciples and constant
patrons.

It was not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before the Buddha’s followers were more formally
incorporated into a monastic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> (Sa?gha), and rules of discipline
drawn up (see pp. 61, 72, 73, 83). And doubtless the success of Buddhism
was due to the carrying out of this idea of establishing a brotherhood
offering a haven of rest to all.

About forty-five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> elapsed between Gautama’s attainment of
Buddhahood and his death. During that period he continued teaching and
itinerating with his disciples; only going ‘into retreat’ during the
rains. A list of 45 places of residence is given. He seems to have
resided oftenest at ?ravasti (p. 21) in the monastery Jetavana <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by
Anatha-pi??ika; but the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> region between ?ravasti and Raja-g?iha (p.
29), for nearly 300 miles, was the scene of his itineration. Favourite
resorts near Raja-g?iha were the ‘Vulture-peak’ and Bambu-grove
(Ve?u-vana); but continual itineration was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> occurred at Ku?i-nagara[16] (Kusinara), a town
about eighty miles east of Kapila-vastu—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of his birth—when he
was eighty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, and probably about the year 420 B.C.[17]

The story is that Gautama died from eating too <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> pork (or dried
boar’s flesh[18]). As this is somewhat derogatory to his dignity it is
not likely to have been fabricated. A fabrication, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> scarcely

and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> setting an example of eating flesh-meat.

These were his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> when he felt his <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> near:—

‘O Ananda, I am now grown old, and full of years, and my journey is
drawing to its close; I have reached eighty years—my sum of days—and

yourselves your own light, your own refuge; seek no other refuge. Hold
fast to the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> as your lamp. Hold fast to the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> as your refuge;

II. 32, 33).

Afterwards he gave a summary of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> monk’s duties, thus:—‘Which then,

Then shortly before his decease, he said, ‘It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be, Ananda, that in

‘Behold now, O monks, I exhort you:—Everything that cometh into being

Not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> after his last utterances the Buddha, who had before through
intense meditation attained Nirva?a or extinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of

23), with the head towards the north. In sculptures he is represented as
lying on his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side at the moment of death, and images of him in
this position are highly venerated.

The chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Ku?i-nagara burnt his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with the ceremonies usual at

to be.

Then his ashes were distributed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> eight princes, who built Stupas
over them (Buddha-va?sa 28).

A legend states that when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> died there was an earthquake. Then
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Brahma and Indra appeared and the latter exclaimed: ‘Transient
are all the elements of being; birth and decay are their nature; they
are born and dissolved; then only is happiness when they have ceased to
be’ (Maha-p° VI. 16).

Contrast with Buddha’s last <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> the last <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Christ: ‘Father,

A greater contrast than that presented by the <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the Buddha’s
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and the Gospel narrative of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> can scarcely be
imagined.

Of course as a result of discourses during forty-five years, a large
number were gathered into Gautama’s monastic Order. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> aim was
the founding of this Order, and his chief sermons were to his monks; but
he accepted all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and ultimately multitudes attached themselves to him
as lay-brethren (p. 87).

In fact Gautama’s doctrine of a universal brotherhood, open to all,
constituted the corner-stone of his popularity. He spoke to them in
their own provincial dialect, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not have differed <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> from
the Pali of the texts—and he enforced his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> by dialogues, parables,
fables, reiterations, and repetitions. Probably he was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
introducer of real preaching into India, and by his practical method he
seemed to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from the clouds to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> man’s door.

The following parable is an example: ‘As the peasant sows the seed but

pleasures the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> comes and opens the false eightfold path. Then
comes the perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and opens the safe eightfold path of <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> belief,
etc.’ (p. 44, Oldenberg, 191, 192).

Six rival heretical teachers are alluded to. His chief opponent was his
cousin Devadatta, who <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up a school of his own, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have
plotted against the Buddha’s life. His efforts failed (Culla-vagga VII),
and he himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to an untimely end. Possibly he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have belonged to
the rival Jaina sect (Niga??ha) of naked ascetics, of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
leader was Vardhamana Mahavira Nata-putta (=Jñati-putra).

Gautama’s teaching gained the day. It claimed universality, and was
aptly symbolized by a wheel rolling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all alike. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> it had
no attractions for the poor and the child-like.

By degrees, a fuller system, adapted in an ascending scale to laymen,
novices, monks, nuns, and Arhats, was developed—a system which had its
abstruse doctrines suited to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of philosophical minds, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as its
plain practical side. This constituted the Buddhist Dharma, which was
ultimately collected in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sacred books to be next described.




                              LECTURE III.
         _The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma) and Sacred Scriptures of Buddhism._


Probably most educated persons are aware that Buddhists have their own
sacred scriptures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Hindus, Parsis, Confucianists, Muhammadans,
Jews, and Christians. It is not, however, so generally <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
important particular these Buddhist scriptures, constituting the
Tri-pi?aka (p. 61), differ wholly from other sacred books. They lay no
claim to supernatural inspiration. Whatever doctrine is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in them
was believed to be purely human—that is, was held to be the product of
man’s own natural faculties working naturally.

The Tri-pi?aka was <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the Veda of the Brahmans, believed to be
the very ‘breath of God’[19]; the same care, therefore, was not taken to
preserve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> sound; and when at last it was written down the result
was a more scholastic production than the Veda.

Moreover, it was not composed in the Sansk?it of the Veda and ?astras—in
the sacred language, the very grammar and alphabet of which were
supposed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from heaven—but in the vernacular of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of India
in which Buddhism flourished. Indeed, it is a significant fact that
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sages of Sansk?it literature and philosophy, such as
Vyasa, Kumarila, and ?a?kara, in all probability spoke and taught in
Sansk?it[20], the Founder of Buddhism preferred to communicate his
precepts to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in their own vernacular, afterwards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pali.
Nevertheless, he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> composed a single <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of his own. In all
probability he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> wrote down any of his own precepts; for if writing
was then invented, it was little practised, through the absence of
suitable materials. This is the more remarkable as Buddhism ultimately
became an instrument for introducing literary culture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> uncivilized
races.

All that Gautama did was to preach his Dharma, ‘Law,’ during forty-five

before they were written down. Itineration, recitation of the Law, and
preaching were the chief instruments for the propagation of Buddhism.

At <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> the Buddhist Canon is about as extensive as the
Brahmanical[21], and in both cases we are left in doubt as to the date
when the books were composed. How, then, did their composition <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span>

arrange the sayings of their Master, but not, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as we know, to

There, in all likelihood, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step towards a methodical

collections were composed. The assembled monks chose Ka?yapa (or
Maha-ka?yapa, p. 47), the most esteemed of all the Buddha’s surviving
disciples, as their leader, and chanted the Thera-vada (Sthavira-v°),
‘words of the elders,’ or precepts of their Founder preserved in the
memory of the older men; the rules of discipline (Vinaya) being recited
by Upali[22], and the ethical precepts (Sutra), which constituted at
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the principal Dharma[23] (_par excellence_, in contradistinction
to the Vinaya), being imparted by Gautama’s favorite Ananda (p. 47);
while the philosophical doctrines—then undeveloped—were communicated by
the president, Ka?yapa. If any arrangement was then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> it was probably
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> collections—the Vinaya and Dharma (say about 400 B.C.)

In regard to the Dharma, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> main lines were, in all likelihood, laid
down as the basis of all early teaching. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> consisted of the four
sublime verities, as they are called—that is, of the four fundamental
truths originally taught by the Founder of Buddhism, namely, the
inevitable inherence of suffering in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of life, the connexion
of all suffering with indulgence of desires, especially with craving for
continuity of existence, the possibility of the cessation of suffering
by restraining lusts and desires, and the eightfold course leading to
that cessation (see p. 44).

The second line of doctrine probably consisted of an outline of the
twelve-linked chain of causality (nidana), which traced back all
suffering to a still deeper origin than mere lusts and desires—namely,
to ignorance (p. 103).

It is not, however, at all likely that any philosophical or metaphysical
doctrines were clearly and methodically formulated at the earliest
assembly which took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon after Gautama’s death. It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more
probable that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> outcome of the gathering <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> of the
Buddha’s disciples was simply the enforcing of some strict rules of
discipline for the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of monks, and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have taken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon
after 400 B.C.

After a time, <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> relaxations of these rules or unauthorized
departures from them (ten in number, such as reception of money-gifts,
eating a second meal in the afternoon, drinking stimulating beverages,
if pure as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> in appearance[24]), began to be common. The question as
to whether liberty should be allowed in these points, _especially in the
first_, shook the very foundations of the community. In fact the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
society became split up into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> contending parties, the strict and the
lax, and a second Council became necessary for the restoration of order.
All ten points were discussed at this Council, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have consisted of
700 monks and held at Vai?ali (Vesali, now Besarh), 27 miles north of
Patna, about 380 B.C.[25] The discussions were protracted for eight
months, and all the ten unlawful relaxations were finally prohibited.

It has been observed that this second Council stands in a relation to
Buddhism very similar to that which the Council of Nicæa bears to
Christianity.

The exact date, however, of either the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> or second assemblies <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span>
be determined with precision.

Not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> afterwards occurred the political revolution caused by the
well-known Candra-gupta (= Sandra-kottus)—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
A?oka (or disparagingly, Kala?oka). This man, who was a low-born ?udra,
usurped the throne and founded the Maurya dynasty, after killing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Nanda and taking possession of Pa?aliputra (or Palibothra, now Patna,
the then metropolis of Magadha or Behar), about 315 B.C. He extended the
kingdom of Magadha over all Hindustan, and became so powerful that when
Alexander’s successor, Seleukos Nikator (whose reign commenced about 312
B.C.), invaded India from his kingdom of Bactria, so effectual was the
resistance offered by Candra-gupta, that the Greek <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it politic to
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> an alliance with the Hindu king, and sent his own countryman,
Megasthenes, as an ambassador to reside at his court.

To this circumstance we owe the earliest authentic <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of Indian
customs and usages, by an intelligent observer who was not a native; and
Megasthenes’ narrative, preserved by Strabo, furnishes a basis on which
a fair inference <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be founded that Brahmanism and Buddhism existed
side by side in India on amicable terms in the fourth and third
centuries B.C. There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> ground for believing that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Candra-gupta
himself favoured the Buddhists, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> outwardly he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> renounced his
faith in Brahmanism.

Candra-gupta’s reign is <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> to have lasted until 291 B.C., and that
of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and successor, Vindusara, from 291 to (say) about 260 B.C.
Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> Candra-gupta’s grandson, the celebrated A?oka (sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharma?oka), who, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> of ?udra origin, was perhaps the
greatest Hindu monarch of India.

It was about this period that Gautama Buddha’s followers began to
develope his doctrines, and to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> additions to them in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
the Abhi-dharma or ‘further Dharma’ had to be added to the ?utra which
constituted the original Dharma (p. 56). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there
were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> dissensions. Afterwards differences of opinion increased, so
that before <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> eighteen schools of schismatic <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> (p. 158) were
established. The resulting controversies were very disturbing, and a
third Council became necessary. It consisted of a thousand oldest
members of the Order, and was held in the 16th or 17th year of A?oka’s
reign at Patna (Pa?ali-putra), about 244-242 B.C.

This third Council was, perhaps, the most important; for through its
deliberations the decision was arrived at to propagate Buddhism by
missions. Hence missionaries, supported by <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka (see p. 66), were
sent in all directions; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> being Mahinda (Mahendra), the king’s
son, who carried the doctrine into Ceylon.

Dr. Oldenberg has shown that in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Tri-pi?aka now extant, the

inference is that the portion of the Buddhist Canon in which the second
Council is described <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be older than that Council. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> in all

Khandhaka, p. 62) was composed before the second Council—possibly as
early as about 400 B.C.—and the rest of the Canon during the succeeding
century and a half before the third Council—that is, from 400 to 250
B.C. It was composed in the then vernacular language of Magadha
(Magadhi), where all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Councils were held.

It seems, however, probable that in each district to which Buddhism
spread the doctrine of its founder was taught in the peculiar dialect
understood by the inhabitants. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> appears likely that when Gautama
himself lived in Kosala (Oudh) he preached in the dialect of that
province just as he taught in Magadhi when he resided in Magadha. The
Culla-vagga (V. 33. I) makes him direct that his precepts should be
learnt by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> convert in the provincial dialect, which doubtless
varied slightly everywhere.

to the sacred texts, and the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> they finally assumed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have
represented the prevalent dialect of the time, and not necessarily the
original Magadhi Prak?it[26]. This final <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the language was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Pali[27] (or Tanti), and no doubt differs from the earlier A?oka
inscription dialect, and from Magadhi Prak?it as now known.

Some think that the Pali resulted from an artificial infusion of
Sansk?it. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that nearly two-fifths of the Pali vocabulary
consists of unmodified Sansk?it.

At any rate, it was in this language that the Buddhist <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> was carried
(probably by Mahendra) into Ceylon, and the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Canon is <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> by
some to have been handed down orally till it was written down there
about 85 B.C. Oral transmission, we know, was common in India, but if
edicts were written by A?oka (p. 67), why should not the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> have been
written down also?

As, however, Pali was not spoken in Ceylon, the Pali commentaries
<span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by Mahendra were translated by him into Sinhalese, and the Pali
originals being lost, were not retranslated into Pali till about the
beginning of the fifth century of our era.

Turning next to the final arrangement of the Pali Canon, we find that it
resolved itself into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> collections (called Tri-pi?aka, Pali
Tipi?aka, ‘Three baskets,’ the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> pi?aka, however, not occurring in
the early texts), namely: 1. Yinaya, ‘discipline’ for the Order; 2.
Sutra-(Pali Sutta), ‘precepts,’ which at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> constituted the principal
Dharma, or moral <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (p. 56); 3. Abhi-dharma (Abhi-dhamma), ‘further
Dharma,’ or additional precepts relative to the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> and philosophy.

This division was not logical, as each collection <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> treat of the
subjects belonging to the others.

Taking, then, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, the Vinaya or discipline portion of
the Buddhist bible, we ought to observe that a portion of it (the
Patimokkha) is not only the oldest, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the most important in its
bearing on the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> theory of Buddhism. For, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> point out more
fully hereafter, the Buddha’s paramount aim was to convince <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> that
to get rid of ignorance, gain knowledge, practise morality, and obtain
deliverance, it was incumbent on a wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to renounce married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a member of a monastic Order.

Pure Buddhism, in fact, was pure monachism—implying celibacy, poverty,
and mendicancy—and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be maintained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> rules for
discipline and outward conduct, which, as adopted by the Buddha, were
simply a modification of the rules for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> religious orders of the
Brahma-cari and Sannyasi, already existing in Brahmanism.

With regard to the classification of the Vinaya rules, they were divided
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sets: _a._ the Khandhaka, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> collections <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

Mark, however, that the Vinaya abounds in details of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and

consists of five Nikayas, or collections, viz. _a._ the Digha, or
collection of 34 <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> suttas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> which is the Maha-parinibbana-sutta
(one of the oldest parts of the Canon after the Patimokkha); _b._ the
Majjhima, or collection of 152 suttas of middling length; _c._ the
Sa?yutta, or collection of 55 groups of joined suttas, some of them very
short; _d._ the A?guttara, or miscellaneous suttas in divisions, which
go on increasing by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> (a?ga); _e._ the Khuddaka, or minor collection,
consisting of fifteen works.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> school, this fifth Nikaya is more correctly referred to
the Abhi-dhamma Pi?aka. In character, however, it conforms more to the
Sutta. Of its fifteen works, perhaps the most important are the
following six:—

The Khuddaka-pa?ha, ‘short readings;’ the Dhamma-pada, ‘precepts of the
Law’ (or ‘verses of the Law,’ or ‘footsteps of the Law’); the Jataka
(with their commentaries), a series of stories relating to about 550[28]
previous births of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 111), which have formed the basis of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> stories in the Pañca-tantra, fables of Æsop, etc.; the
Sutta-nipata, ‘collection of discourses;’ the Thera-gatha ( =
Sthavira-g°), ‘verses or stanzas by elder monks;’ Theri-gatha, ‘verses
by elder nuns.’

The other nine are the Udana, containing 82 short suttas and joyous
utterances of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at crises of his life; the Itivuttaka, ‘thus it
was said’ ( = ity ukta), 110 sayings of the Buddha; the Vimana-vatthu,
on the mansions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (which move about at will and sometimes
descend on earth); the Peta-vatthu ( = Preta-vastu, Peta standing for
Preta and Pit?i), on departed spirits; the Niddesa, a commentary on the
Sutta-nipata; the Pa?i-sambhida, on the supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
Arhats; the Apadana (Sansk?it Avadana), ‘stories about the achievements’
of Arhats; the Buddha-va?sa, or history of the 24 preceding Buddhas (the
Digha mentions only six) and of Gautama; the Cariya-pi?aka, ‘treasury of
acts,’ giving stories based on the Jatakas, describing Gautama’s
acquisition of the ten transcendent virtues (p. 128) in former births.

The <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> included in this Sutta-pi?aka frequently <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
conversations on doctrine and morality, between Gautama, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his
chief disciples, and some inquirer. As constituting the ethical Dharma,
they are the most interesting portion of the Canon.

With regard to the third Pi?aka, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Abhi-dhamma (Abbhi-dharma,
‘further dharma’), which is held by modern scholars to be of later
origin and supplementary to the Sutta (p. 62), it contains seven prose
works[29]. Moreover, it was once <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> to relate entirely to
metaphysics and philosophy; but this is now held to be an error, for all
seven <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> treat of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> variety of subjects, including discipline
and ethics. Metaphysical discussions occur, but it is probable that
originally <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> kept clear of metaphysics (see p. 98).

Besides the numerous <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> we have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described as constituting the

Pali <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> was lost and some of the commentaries were retranslated into
Pali by Buddha-ghosha, ‘he who had the very voice of Buddha,’ at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span>
of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century of our era.

The Maha-va??a or ‘history of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> families of Ceylon,’ a

A?oka. It is usual to call this second and more celebrated A?oka the
Constantine of Buddhism. Being of ?udra origin he was the more inclined
to favour the popular teaching of Gautama, and, as he was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
who adopted Buddhism openly (about 257 B.C.) he doubtless did for
Buddhism very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> what Constantine did for Christianity.

The Buddhist system then spread over the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> kingdom of A?oka, and
thence over other portions of India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to some outlying
countries. For gradually during this period most of the petty princes of
India, from Peshawar and Kashmir to the river Kistna, and from Surat to
Bengal and Orissa, if not actually <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> under subjection to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
of Magadha, were compelled to acknowledge his paramount authority.

This is proved by A?oka’s edicts, which are inscribed on rocks and stone
pillars[32] (the earliest dating from about 251 B.C.), and are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in
frontier districts separated from each other by enormous distances.

These inscriptions are of the greatest interest and value, as furnishing
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> authentic records of Indian history. They are written in a
more ancient language than the Pali of Ceylon, and in at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> dialects. Ten of the most important are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> on six rocks and
five pillars (La?s), <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> numerous other monuments are scattered over
Northern India, from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal, from the
Vindhya range on the south to the Khaibar <span class="t11 hoverable">Pass</span> on the north[33].

In these proclamations and edicts (one of which was addressed to the
third Buddhist Council), <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka, who calls himself Priya-dar?i (Pali
Piya-dassi), issues various orders. He prohibits the slaughter of
animals for food or sacrifice, gives directions for what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

appoints missionaries for the propagation of Buddhist doctrines,
inculcates peace and mercy, charity and toleration, morality and
self-denial, and what is still more remarkable, enjoins quinquennial
periods of national humiliation and confession of sins by all classes,
accompanied by a re-proclamation of the Buddha’s precepts. A?oka, in
fact, became so zealous a friend of Buddhism, that he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have
maintained 64,000 Buddhist monks in and around the country of Magadha,
which was on that <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of monasteries (Vihara = the
modern Bihar or Behar).

No doubt it was A?oka’s propagation of Buddhism by missions in various
countries—where it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> in contact with and partly adopted various
already existing indigenous faiths and superstitions—that led to the
ultimate separation of the Buddhist system into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> divisions
of Southern and Northern.

Indeed, the formation of a Northern School, as distinct from a Southern,
became inevitable after the conversion of Kanishka, the Indo-Scythian
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Kashmir, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from the North, and became a zealous Buddhist.
He probably reigned in the second half of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> century (A.D.), and
extended his dominions as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as Gujarat, Sindh, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Mathura (see

It was during Kanishka’s reign that a fourth Council[34] was held at
Jalandhara in Kashmir, under Par?va and Vasu-mitra. It consisted of 500
monks, who composed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Sansk?it <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of commentaries
(Upade?a, Vinaya-vibhasha, Abhidharma-vibhasha) on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Pali
Pi?akas. These were the earliest books of the Maha-yana or Northern
School, which afterwards formulated its more developed doctrines on the
Indus, while the Pali Canon of the South represented the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine
promulgated on the Ganges.

Kashmir was a centre of Sansk?it learning, and Kanishka, who was a
patron of it, became to Northern Buddhism what A?oka had been to
Southern. Hence in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> other Northern Buddhist books were
written in Sansk?it, with occasional Gathas or stanzas in an irregular
dialect, half Sansk?it, half Prak?it.

It is usual to enumerate nine Nepalese canonical scriptures
(Dharmas):—1.Prajña paramita, ‘transcendent knowledge,’ or an abstract
of metaphysical and mystic philosophy; 2. Ga??a-vyuha; 3.
Da?a-bhumi?-vara (describing the ten stages leading to Buddhahood); 4.
Samadhi-raja; 5. La?kavatara; 6. Saddharma-pu??arika, ‘Lotus of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span>

Lalita-vistara (giving a legendary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Buddha); 9. Suvar?a-prabhasa.
The eighth is probably as <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as the 2nd century of our era, and next
comes the sixth. Tibetan translations were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of all of them. These
extend to 100 volumes and are collectively <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ka’gyur or Kan’gyur

traveller, Alexander Csoma de Körös.

Copies of the Sanskrit <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> were <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to England by Mr. B. H.
Hodgson. The sixth has been translated by Burnouf and recently by H.
Kern. Dr. Rajendralala-mitra has edited the eighth. As to the
non-canonical <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> M. Senart has edited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Maha-vastu, and
Professor E. B. Cowell and Mr. R. A. Neil, the Divyavadana. They contain
interesting <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> legends—some about the achievements of A?oka, some about
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, some perhaps from lost Vinaya books.

As to the Pali written character, it is a question whether that current
in the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Buddhism, or in Ceylon, or in Siam (Kambodia), or in
Burma—that is, Devanagari, Sinhalese, Kambodian, or Burmese—should be
used. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> think Burmese most suited to it, and in Europe the Roman
character is preferred.

It should be added that the recitation (Bha?a, Sansk?it root Bha?, ‘to
speak;’ in Sinhalese spelt Ba?a) of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the principal

intoning is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sara-bhañña (sara = svara). The Buddha, they say, is
not extinct, for he lives in the Dharma and in the Sa?gha, in the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span>
and in the monks who recite it. Hence the importance of recitation in
the Buddhist system (p. 84).

already established in India. He himself was a Hindu of the Hindus, and
he remained a Hindu to the end. His very name, Gautama, connected him
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most celebrated Hindu sages, and was significant of his
original connexion with orthodox Brahmanism. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> he was a

Nor had the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> any idea of courting popularity as a champion of

rather to be claimed for him is that he was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to establish a
universal brotherhood (Sa?gha) of cœnobite monks, open to all persons of

as a rule, lived alone), and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to affirm that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

not confined to the Brahmans, but open to all the members of all castes.
This was the only <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which he abolished caste. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> followers,
however, constituted a caste of their own, distinguished from the laity.
From the want of a more suitable term we are forced to call them
‘monks[35].’

And this <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of monks was not a hierarchy. It had no ecclesiastical
organization under any centralized authority. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Head, Gautama,

all were under <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> obligations of celibacy, moral restraint,
fasting, poverty, itineration and confession to each other—all were
dominated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> idea, and pledged to the propagation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

principal object.

In point of fact, the so-called enlightenment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> which entitled him
to Buddhahood, led him at the early stage of his career into no abstruse
or transcendental region of thought, but took a very practical
direction. It led him to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that an association of monks offering

In brief, a carefully regulated monastic brotherhood, which opened its
arms to all comers of all ranks, and enforced on its members the duty of
extending its boundaries by itinerancy, and by constantly rolling onward

But we repeat that in this, his main design, Gautama was after all no
innovator; no introducer of novel ideas.

Monachism had always been a favourite adjunct of the Brahminanical
system, and respect for monastic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> had taken deep root <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the

<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Sannyasi, ‘ascetic,’ or Bhikshu, ‘mendicant,’ wandering from
door to door. In fact, it was through these very states of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that
Gautama himself, as a Kshatriya, was theoretically bound to have passed.

Hindu monks, therefore, were numerous before Buddhism. They belonged to
various sects, and took various vows of self-torture, of silence, of
fasting, of poverty, of mendicancy, of celibacy, of abandoning caste,
rank, wife and family. Accordingly they had various names. The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>

Vairagi, ‘free from affections;’ Yogi, ‘seeking mystic union with the

austerities;’ Yati, ‘restraining desires;’ Jitendriya, ‘conquering
passions;’ ?rama?a, ‘undergoing discipline;’ Bhikshu, ‘living by alms;’
Nirgrantha, ‘without ties.’ Such names prove that asceticism was an
ancient institution. The peculiarity about Gautama’s teaching in regard
to monachism was that he discouraged[36] solitary asceticism, severe
austerities, and irrevocable vows, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> he enjoined moral restraint in
celibate fraternities, conformity to rules of discipline, upright
conduct, and confession to each other.

His usual mode of designating his monks was by the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> term Bhikshu
(Pali Bhikkhu), ‘living by alms,’ to indicate their poverty. They were

Arhatship (p. 132) were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Arya.

The term ?ravaka, ‘hearers,’ seems to have been used in the Hina-yana
system to denote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> disciples only, and especially those ‘great

We perceive again the close connexion between Brahmanism and Buddhism;
for clearly the Brahma-cari and Sannyasi of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> became the ?rama?era

As to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of admission, there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> strictness in early

when the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> increased that murderers, robbers, debtors, soldiers and
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> in the King’s service, lepers, cripples, blind, one-eyed, deaf
and dumb, and consumptive persons, and all subject to fits were
rejected[38].

Originally it was enough for the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> to have said, ‘Come (ehi),
follow me.’ This alone conferred discipleship. In time, however, he
commissioned those he had himself admitted to admit others. Then the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of admission to the brotherhood was divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stages, marked

ordination services for deacon and priest. At any rate the term
‘ordination’ is wholly misleading, if any idea of a priestly commission
or gift of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers be implied.

The youthful layman who desired admission to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> degree, or that

The admission ceremony of a novice was extremely simple, and confined to
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> acts and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the candidate, witnessed by any

Very remarkably, this, the only prayer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, resembled the
Gayatri or sacred prayer of the Veda (repeated by the Brahma-cari) in
consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times eight syllables. But if the Buddhist novice
had a <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to the Brahma-cari’s sacred cord (upavita), this was
probably abandoned on admission. He was then instructed in the Ten
Precepts (Dasa-sila or sikkha-pada), which were really ten prohibitions
(Maha-vagga I. 56), requiring ten abstinences (verama?i):—

1. from destroying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (pa?atipato = pra?atipata); 2. from taking

from speaking falsely (musa-vada = m?isha-vada); 5. from drinking strong
drinks (sura); 6. from eating at forbidden times (vikala-bhojana); 7.
from dancing, singing, music, and worldly spectacles (visuka); 8. from
garlands, scents, unguents or ornaments; 9. from the use of a high or
broad bed; 10. from receiving gold or silver. The prohibition not to
receive money, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in return for religious teaching or any supposed
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> benefits conferred, was held to be most important, and was for
a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> obeyed, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> monasteries became owners of large
property and landed estates.

Of course the Upasampada, or admission to full monkhood (described
Maha-vagga I. 76), was a more formal ceremony. A conclave (Sa?gha) of at
least ten monks was required. The candidate had to appear before them,
but was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instructed by some competent and learned monk as to the

This
instructor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> directed him to choose some other monk competent to act
as his Upadhyaya (upajjhaya) or teacher for five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after his
admission, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> him provide himself with an alms-bowl and with the
usual yellow monkish vestments. Then his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instructor presented
himself before the conclave and informed them that the candidate was
ready to be admitted. Thereupon the novice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> forward, adjusted his
upper garment so as to cover the left shoulder, bowed down before the
feet of the assembled monks, seated himself on the ground, and, raising
his joined hands, asked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times for admission to the full monkhood,
thus:—‘I entreat the Sa?gha for full monkhood (Upasampada), have
compassion on me and uproot me (ullumpatu mam) from the world,’ repeated
thrice.

Thereupon he was questioned [not, as in our Ordination Service: ‘Are you
inwardly moved by the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> you this office?’ Not:
‘Will you apply all your diligence to frame and fashion your own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
and that of your family so as to be wholesome examples?’ but] thus:—Are
you free from leprosy, boils, consumption, fits, etc. Are you a male?
Are you a free <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and not in the royal service? Are you free from

old? Have you an alms-bowl and vestments? What is your name? What is
your teacher’s name?

If the answers were satisfactory the candidate was admitted. After
admission no prayer was pronounced [such as in our Ordination Service:
‘We beseech Thee, merciful Father, send on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> servant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> heavenly

informed that he was to trust to only four Resources (nissaya), and to
abstain from four chief forbidden acts (akara?iyani). These four
Resources and four Prohibitions were then communicated to him thus:—

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> the four Resources as follow:—(1) Broken morsels <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in alms for
food; (2) Rags from a dust-heap for clothes; (3) Roots of trees for an
abode; (4) Liquid putrefying excreta of cows for medicine. Note,
however, that, in practice, indulgences (atirekha-labha) were in all
four cases allowed; such as, better food when it happened to be given,
or when invited to dinner by rich laymen; linen, cotton, or woollen
garments, if dyed yellow and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces (but only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> change was
allowed); houses, huts, or caves to dwell in, when not itinerating;
ghee, honey, or molasses when out of health (Maha-v° I. 30. 4).

Next the four chief Prohibitions (compare the Ten Prohibitions, p. 78),
viz.:—(1) Unchastity and sexual acts of any kind; (2) Taking anything
not given, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a blade of grass; (3) Killing any living thing, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> an
ant, or worm, or plant; (4) Falsely claiming the extraordinary powers of
a perfected saint (uttarimanussa-dhamma. Maha-v° I. 78. 2).

Clearly there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temptations to gain celebrity by claiming such
powers, or else this fourth prohibition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not have terminated the
ceremony.

So soon as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was admitted to full monkhood, he <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> through a five
years’ course of instruction in the entire doctrine and discipline,
under the preceptor (Upadhyaya, Acarya) who had been previously chosen
and was required to be of at least ten years’ standing.

This was a modification of the Brahmanical rule that a student
(Brahma-cari) should study under his preceptor for thirty-six years, or
less, until he knew the Veda.

The full Buddhist monk had in theory to dwell under trees or in huts
formed of leaves (pa?-sala = pa??a-sala = par?a-?ala); but practically
he resided in collections of simple mud or brick tenements, in cells, or
in rows of caves hewn out of rocky hills. At any rate, collections of
monastic dwellings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Viharas[41], were his usual abode during
Vassa (or the rainy season, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 82); and at such times he had
fellow-monks (saddhiviharika) living in companies around him, or in the
same monastery.

Strict discipline was supposed to be enforced, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there was no
central authority, no Chief Hierarch, no Archbishop whom he was bound
‘reverently to obey.’

Offences against the four forbidden acts were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Parajika apatti,
‘offences meriting expulsion from the community of monks (Sa?gha).’

Then there were thirteen Sa?ghadisesa apatti, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Dukkata
or less serious offences, requiring only confession before the Sa?gha,
and dealt with by a Sa?gha-kamma, or act of a conclave of monks imposing
some penance. There were penances (Praya?-citta) for lying,
prevarication, abusive language, destroying vegetable or animal life,
etc. (see Patimokkha, Pacittiya dhamma, and pp. 62, 84). The following
practices were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> incumbent on all monks:—

waking and sleeping, in dressing and undressing, in standing and

and not speaking, the Buddhist monk had to submit to the most stringent

It was a noteworthy feature in Buddhist monachism that monks were <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
allowed to appear in public in a state of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> semi-nudity. ‘Properly

(sa?gha?i) and an upper robe (uttarasa?ga) worn loosely and <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>

between the Buddhist monks and the Jaina and other naked ascetics <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>
want of decency the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> condemned.

The Buddhist monk’s daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> probably began by meditation and by his
reciting or intoning (Bha?a, Sarabhañña) portions of the Law, or by
hearing it recited, followed perhaps by lessons in doctrine, or by
discussions or by confessions. Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> itineration for food, followed

Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> rest and further meditation and
recitation, while possibly the senior monks preached to laymen. Such
preaching took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> especially during Vassa. In later times the daily
duties included offering flowers, etc., at sacred shrines, and repeating
so-called prayers, which were merely forms of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> used as charms.

To illustrate the immensely meritorious efficacy of constant recitation
of the Law, a story is told of five hundred bats that lived in a cave
where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> monks daily recited the Dharma. These bats gained such merit
by simply hearing the sound that when they died they were all re-born as

Doubtless quarrels and faults of omission and commission occurred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>
the monks, especially during their residence <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in Vassa
(miscalled the Buddhist Lent). We read of six monks named Chabbaggiya
who were constantly committing offences. Hence a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pavara?a

been preserved.

Uposatha <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> the Patimokkha or general confession (p. 62) was recited.
The confession was by monks to each other, not by laymen to monks,

A?oka enjoined periodical ceremonies, and expression of sorrow for sins

of sin or absolution in our sense, but only release from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

We have learnt, then, that Buddhist monks were not under irrevocable
vows. They undertook to obey rules of discipline, but took no actual
vows—not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of obedience to a superior. Buddhist monkhood was purely
voluntary, so that all were free to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> and go. It had <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span>
hereditary about it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the rank of a Brahman.

We have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> learnt, that the term ‘priest’ is not suitably applied to
Buddhist monks. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism has no ecclesiastical hierarchy, no

rites, no prayer, no worship in the proper <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of these terms. Each
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was a priest to himself in so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as he depended on himself alone
for internal sanctification.

Evidently, too, all Buddhist monks were integral parts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> organic
whole. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> they were collected in various
monasteries, each of which practically became an independent Sa?gha
(each under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Head). But in theory all were parts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same

that term is meant an ecclesiastical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with legislative functions,

Head; for as founded by the Buddha, it was not this. It was simply a
vast fraternity intended to embrace all monks of the four quarters
(caturdi?a) of the world, from the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself and the perfected
Arhat (p. 133), to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> monk of the lowest degree, but not a single
layman. <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> in its <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> the Sa?gha comprised only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

(p. 132).

And here observe that, notwithstanding the stigma attached to unmarried
women in India, Gautama in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> permitted an <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of Nuns (Pali
Bhikkhuni) and female novices (Sama?eri, p. 47). The Culla-vagga (X. I.
3) relates how women were indebted to the intercession of a monk,
Gautama’s cousin Ananda, for permission to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> an Order, and how

Gautama replied: ‘Don’t <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> them.’ ‘But if we should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> them, what are
we to do?’ ‘Don’t speak to them.’ ‘But if they speak to us, what then?’
‘Let your thoughts be fixed in deep meditation’ (Sati upa??hapetabba.
Maha-parin° V. 23).

Clearly the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was originally a misogynist as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as a misogamist,
and wished his followers to be misogynists also. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> when he had been

The Buddha’s exhortation to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> nun is noteworthy:—‘Whatsoever, O
Gotami (Maha-prajapati), conduces to absence of passion, to absence of
pride, to wishing for little and not for much, to seclusion and not to
<span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of society, to earnest effort and not to indolence, to contentment
and not to querulousness, verily that is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> doctrine’ (Culla-v° X.
5).

It was certainly a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> gain for a woman when she was permitted to
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a nun (or a Theri); for, as a nun, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> attain
Arhatship. This is clearly laid down in Culla-vagga X. 1. 3. 4. No
woman, however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> attain to Buddhahood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being born as a man,
so that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> scarcely be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that in <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> there is ‘neither male
nor female.’

Such, then, was the monachism which constituted the very pith and marrow
of Buddhism. All truly enlightened disciples of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> were monks or
nuns.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us not forget, however, that in practice Buddhism admitted
lay-brothers, lay-sisters, married householders and working-men, as
necessary adjuncts.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> they were only appendages. Of course the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> knew very <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> that
it was not possible to enforce celibacy on all his followers. He knew
that having prohibited his monks from making or taking money or holding
property, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to depend on lay-associates and householders
for food, clothing, and habitation, and that, if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> layman were to
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a monk, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done, no food produced, no

Universal monkhood, in short, <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have been a consummation to be aimed
at in some Utopia; but was practically unattainable. In fact Gautama had
to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as he <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> it, and the very idea of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
perpetuating itself—according to his own theory of a constant succession
of birth, decay, and reproduction—implied that a youth, on reaching
manhood, married, had children, worked and earned a livelihood for their
support. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not impose this burden on others.

Besides, the generality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were in Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> what they are in

always commanded respect in India; but in no country of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has

that the following sentiments, enunciated by the Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have met
with general approval:—

‘A wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should avoid married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (abrahma-cariyam) as if it were a
burning pit of live coals’ (Dhammika-Sutta 21).

‘Full of hindrances is married life, defiled by passion. How can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who
dwells at home live the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in all its purity?’ (Tevijja-Sutta
47).

And in reality Buddha’s anti-matrimonial doctrines _did_ excite
opposition. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> murmured and said, ‘He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span>
childlessness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> us, and widowhood, and destruction of family-life.’
Indeed, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> facts—first, that the foundations of Buddhism were not
laid (as those of Christianity notably are), on the hallowed hearth of
home and on the sacred rock of family-life with its daily round of
honest work; and—secondly, that the precept enjoining monkhood and
abstinence from marriage was not combined with any organized
ecclesiastical hierarchy under a central government, are sufficient to
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for the circumstance that Buddhism <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> gained any real
stability in India.

No doubt lay-brethren were always welcomed; but they were bound to
Buddhism by very slender ties in regard to dogma, and were only expected
to conform to the simplest possible code of morality.

Probably the only <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of admission for a layman was the repetition of
the 24 syllables of the three-refuge (tri-?ara?a) formula:—‘I go for
refuge to the Buddha, his <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and his Order’ (p. 78). It was of course
understood that he was to abstain from the five gross sins (p. 126), but
he was already bound to do so by the rules of Hindu caste and
family-religion. The chief test of his Buddhism was his readiness to
serve the monks. It was for this reason, I think, that lay-adherents
were not called, as <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have been expected, ?ravakas, ‘Hearers,’ but
simply Upasakas, ‘Servers,’ and in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of women Upasikas. They
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> disciples of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the _truest sense_, unless
they entered his monastic Order.

Of course the majority of Buddhist householders <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> cared to do this.
Their chief religion consisted in giving food and clothing, earned by
daily toil, to the monks[42]. If they failed in this, there was only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
punishment. They were forbidden the privilege of giving at all, and so
of accumulating a store of merit. No monk was allowed to ask them for a
single thing. Of course, too, the majority of Buddhist householders were
worldly-minded; they were no believers in ultra-pessimistic views of
life. They looked for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in some heaven, not Nirva?a. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> in theory
all laymen <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> enter the paths of sanctification (p. 132), and
thousands of earnest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have done so[43].

A layman’s progress, however, towards Arhatship, except through monkhood
and abandoning the world, was almost hopelessly barred. At page 264 of
the Milinda-pañha it is implied that an earnest layman <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> an
Arhat, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> while still a layman, but he had either to enter monkhood or
else to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in Pari-nirva?a (p. 140) at the moment of becoming so.

The best proof of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of this view of the matter is, that after a
layman had attached himself to the Buddha, the Law, and the Order, he
was not required to undergo any initiatory ceremony, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> baptism, or to
receive any stamp of membership, or to assume a peculiar dress, or to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up all belief in his family religion, or caste-customs. In short,
he did not as a lay-brother break entirely with Hinduism.

That universal tolerance was of the very essence of Buddhism is
indicated by A?oka’s twelfth edict:—‘The beloved of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> honours all
forms of religious faith—there ought to be reverence for one’s own faith
and no reviling of that of others.’ Compare p. 126.

Nor did Gautama himself ever <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> an example of intolerance. He <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
railed at the Brahmans. He treated them with respect, and taught <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>
to do so; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> adopted the title Brahma?a for his own saints and
Arhats (Dhamma-pada 383-423).

What he opposed was priestcraft and superstition, not Brahmanism; as
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> other reformers had done before him. Probably the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
receptivity of Buddhism was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the causes that led to its decay in
India.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> Gautama’s victory over <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most inveterate propensities in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> nature—the tendency to seek salvation through a mediatorial caste
of priests—was a wonderful achievement. This is proved by the fact that
his followers in other countries became re-entangled in a network of
priestcraft, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more enslaving than that out of which he had rescued
them.

Koeppen, Rhys Davids, and other writers have <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> shown that the
Buddhism of Tibet, with its Pope-like grand Lamas—its cardinals and
abbots, monks and mendicant friars, nuns and novices, canonized saints
and angelic hosts, temples and costly shrines, monasteries and
nunneries, images and pictures, altars and relics, robes and mitres,
rosaries and consecrated water, litanies and chants, processions and
pilgrimages, confessions and penances, bell-ringing and incense—is in
everything, except doctrine, almost a counterpart of the Romish system.
How little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> have foreseen such a development of his
brotherhood of monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> chief duties were meditation and

Do we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> anywhere evidences of that enlightenment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span>
which Buddhism claims as its chief characteristic?

When I was travelling in Ceylon, I met a few learned monks, but the
majority seemed to me idle, ignorant, and indifferent.

In Burma the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pungis (Phongies), and are a little more
active. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> youth in Burma is supposed for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to inhabit a
monastery.

In Tibet the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lamas (a lower title being Gelong) and
constitute a large proportion of the population. They are slaves to
gross superstitions. Some are mere devil-charmers, a belief in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits being the chief religion of the people.

In China the monks are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ho-shang (or Ho-sang). They constitute the
only section of the population who have a <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Buddhists,
though, after all, they are mere pseudo-Buddhists. Professor Legge
informs me that he has <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> a few learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> them, and learned
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> have been written by them. But the general testimony of Europeans
in China is that the mass of the monks there are simply drones, or
aimless dreamers, who go through their repetitions by rote. Almost all
are conspicuous for apathy, inertness, and a vacant idiotic expression
of countenance.

Clearly we have in their condition an example of the fact that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

Nemesis. Surely we have in these monkish fraternities an illustration of
the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that any transgression of the laws of nature, common-sense,
and reason—any suppression of the primary instincts of humanity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> in

<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> is that while Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> denied the existence of Brahma as a
personal Creator, and repudiated the Veda and all Vedic sacrifices and
ceremonial observances, he at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the philosophical
teaching of the Brahmans the point of departure for his own peculiar
philosophical teaching.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> noteworthy point is that while Buddhism was undoubtedly a
modification of philosophical Brahmanism, the latter was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> modified
by an interchange with Buddhistic ideas.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> certainly be questioned whether Gautama himself, in the early
stages of his career, ever caused <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> offence to the most orthodox
Brahmans by the free expression of his opinions. He did not spare either
his criticism or sarcasm, but it is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that the Brahmans were
not only tolerant of criticism; they were equally critical themselves,
and delighted in controversial discussions, as they do to this day.

In the Tevijja-Sutta an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> of a discussion in which,

excited any wrath in his opponent—a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> named Vasettha.

The argument attributed to the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is so remarkable that a portion of
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> here:—

And that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
the ?ishis of old, the utterers of the ancient verses, which the
Brahmans of to-day so carefully intone and recite precisely as they have
been handed down—even they did not pretend to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> or to have seen where

‘Now what think you, Vasettha? Does it not follow, this being so, that
the talk of the Brahmans, versed <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they be in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas, is
foolish talk?

‘Verily, Vasettha, that Brahmans versed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Vedas should be

‘As when a string of blind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are clinging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to the other, <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span>

These no doubt were trenchant words, but it <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> easily be shown that
the Brahmans themselves did not scruple to use almost as strong language
against their own revelation. For instance, the Chandogya Upanishad (p.
473) speaks of the Veda as ‘mere name’ (nama eva). The B?ihadara?yaka
Upanishad declares that when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is in a condition of knowledge, ‘the

describes the sacrificial Veda as inferior to Brahma-vidya.

sacrifices (Yajña), of ceremonial rites, of lustral washings, penances
and pilgrimages, as enjoined in the Mantra and Brahma?a portion of the
Veda, in Manu, the Law-books and parts of the Pura?as.

The second was ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of faith’ (bhakti), <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> by that term

<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> there can be no doubt that it was generally held by the Brahmans

What the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> then did was this:—First he stretched out the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>

Then he abolished the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and second ways of
salvation (p. 95), that is, Yajña, ‘sacrifices,’ and Bhakti, ‘devotion

Was it some deep mystery? Some occult doctrine of physical or

ancient traditions. Nor was he a mere enthusiast claiming to be the sole

Unhappily, however, we are here met by a difficulty. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> never,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Muhammad, wrote a book, or, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as we know, a line. He was the
Socrates of India, and we are obliged to trust to the record of his
sayings (see p. 38). Still we have no reason to doubt the genuineness of
what was for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> handed down orally in regard to the doctrines he
taught, and we are struck with the fact that Gautama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> his own

_vid_, ‘to know’). Probably by doing so he wished to imply that his own

consciousness, and self-enlightening intellect, and was to be
distinguished from _Veda_ or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> obtainable through the Brahmans
alone, and by them through supernatural revelation only. Hence, too, he
gave to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> being destined to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> the title Bodhi-sattva

Moreover, the doctrines which grew out of his own special <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

getting rid of the bugbear of metempsychosis, and how common was the
doctrine that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible

continued to be a thoroughly Hindu idea <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> after the disappearance of
Buddhism. Witness the following from the Maitraya?i Upanishad:—

In India, on the contrary, the Upanishads and systems of philosophy
which followed on them, all harped on the same string. They all dwelt on
the same minor key-note. Their real object was not to investigate truth,
but to devise a scheme for removing the misery believed to result from
repeated bodily existence and from all action, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad, in the
present, previous, and future births.

The Sa?khya (I. 1) defines the chief aim of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to be deliverance from

(I. 2), from the pain resulting from birth, actions, and false
knowledge; while the Vedanta considers that ignorance alone fetters the

perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of Buddhism) as a being unaffected by pain (kle?a), acts,
consequences of acts, and impressions derived from acts done in previous
births (a?aya = sa??kara).

Gautama’s sympathy with these ideas is shown by the twelve-linked chain
of causation, <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> by him as an accompaniment to his four
fundamental truths (p. 43), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> expressed (Maha-vagga I. 1. 2):—

From Ignorance comes the combination of formations or tendencies
(instincts derived from former births[49]); from such formations comes
consciousness (vijñana); from consciousness, <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> being
(nama-rupa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> and form); from <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> being, the six organs of
<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> (including mind); from the six organs, contact (with objects of
sense); from contact, sensation (vedana); from sensation, desire (lust,
thirst, ta?ha = t?ish?a); from desire, clinging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (upadana); from
clinging to life, continuity of becoming (bhava); from continuity of
becoming, birth; from birth, decay and death; from decay and death,
suffering.

It is difficult to discover a strictly logical sequence in this curious
twelve-linked chain. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> link is a cause, the ten following are
both causes and effects, while the last is an effect only. The second

109), and we have the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> inverted in a kind of circular chain in the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of question and answer, thus:—

What is the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of misery and suffering? _Answer_—Old age and death.
What is the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> age and death? _Answer_—Birth. Of birth?
_Answer_—Continuity of becoming. Of continuity of becoming?
_Answer_—Clinging to life. Of clinging to life? _Answer_—Desire. Of
desire? _Answer_—Sensation or perception. Of sensation? _Answer_—Contact
with the objects of sense. Of contact with objects? _Answer_—The organs
of sense. Of the organs? _Answer_—Name and form, or <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> being. Of
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> being? _Answer_—Consciousness (viñña?a = vijñana). Of
consciousness? _Answer_—Combination of formations or tendencies (or
those material and mental predispositions derived from previous births
which tend to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> character, compare p. 109). Of such formations?
_Answer_—Ignorance.

In making Ignorance (Avidya) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of the misery of life,
Gautama agreed with the Vedanta (though he explained Ignorance
differently, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 99), while in the remaining chain of causes (Nidana)
we detect his sympathy with the Sa?khya theory of a chain of producers
and products.

His own scheme of causation (often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pa?icca-samuppado) occupies an
important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in Buddhistic philosophy, as supplementary to, and
complementary of, the four truths (p. 43). It was <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> out before
them (see p. 39) and is equally revered.

It is on this <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> that the following celebrated formula is
constantly repeated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a short creed, and is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> carved on numerous
Buddhist monuments:—

‘Conditions (or laws) of existence which proceed from a cause, the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span>
of these <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> explained, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the cessation (or
destruction) of these. Of such truths is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> ?rama?a the
teacher[50].’

This was the formula repeated by Assaji to Sariputta and Moggallana (p.
47), when they wished to join the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and asked for a summary of the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (artha), not the letter (vyañjana), of his doctrine (Maha-v° I.
23. 5). Certainly the sorites-like <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of statement in the scheme of

Moreover the Buddha’s method of clothing <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> truths in a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> dress,

Of what kind, then, was the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> dress in which Gautama clothed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
central doctrine of Indian philosophy—the doctrine of metempsychosis,
involving the perpetuation of the misery of life?

The Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all Indians, was by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> a metaphysician. He had

disbelieved in the existence of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> as distinct from bodily organism?
A little consideration will perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> clear how he was <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to his
own peculiar agnostic view.

Probably before his so-called enlightenment and attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> as the most orthodox Brahman. He had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> imbued with
Brahmanical philosophy while sitting at the feet of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> teachers
A?ara and Uddaka (p. 29). At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there were no definite or
formulated philosophical systems, separated from each other by sharp
lines. But the Sa?khya, Yoga, and Vedanta systems were assuming shape,
and the doctrines they embodied had been foreshadowed in the Upanishads,
and were orally current.

In short, it had been repeatedly stated in the Upanishads, that <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span>
really existed but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> universally <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> impersonal Spirit, and
that the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> visible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> was really to be identified with that
Spirit.

Then it followed as an article of faith that man’s spirit, deluded into
a temporary false idea of separate independent personal existence by the
illusion of ignorance, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> identical with that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Spirit, and
ultimately to be re-absorbed into it.

Further, it followed that man’s spirit, while so deluded and so
separated for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Spirit, was compelled to migrate
through innumerable bodily forms, and that such migration entailed
misery, from which there was no escape except by a process of
disillusionment, that is, by dissipating the illusion of separate
individuality, through the acquisition of perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> leading to
re-union with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Spirit, as the river blends with the ocean. And
such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was best gained by suppression of the passions,
abandonment of all worldly connexions, and abstinence from all action.
Finally, it was held, with apparent inconsistency, that the storing up
of merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> assisted in effecting this object by raising a
man, not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> fit for union with the supreme Spirit, to forms of
existence in which such union <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be accomplished.

Now it is obvious that to believe in the ultimate merging of man’s
personal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> impersonal Spirit, is virtually to deny the
ultimate existence of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> at all. Nay more—it is virtually
to deny the existence of a supreme universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> also.

For how can a merely abstract universal Spirit, which is unconscious of
personality, be regarded as possessing any real existence worth being
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> life?

To assert that such a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is pure abstract Entity or (according to
Vedanta phraseology) pure Existence (without anything to exist for),
pure <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">Thought</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> pure Consciousness (without anything to think
about, or be conscious about), pure Joy (without anything to rejoice
about), is practically to reduce it to pure non-entity.

All that Gautama did, therefore, was to purge Brahmanism of a dogma
which appeared to him to be a mere sham (Brahma-jala I. 26).

He simply eliminated as incapable of proof the doctrine of a purely
abstract, incorporeal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> or self, whether <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> or divine. The
assertion that any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> or Ego really existed (Atta-vado) was an
error. It formed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the constituents of Upadana (p. 109), and was
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of the ten fetters (Sakkaya-di??hi, p. 127).

And with the rejection of this dogma, as incapable of demonstration, he
<span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> himself compelled to reject also, as beyond the range of man’s
cognizance, the doctrine of any Supreme Being <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the perfectly
enlightened man. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> Kapila in the Sa?khya aphorisms (I. 92, V. 10) he
felt bound to admit: ‘It is not proved that there is a God.’

This, indeed, is the chief foundation on which rests the assertion that
Buddhism is a mere system of atheistic negations. And there can be no
doubt that from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> point of view its statements are steeped in
negations, or rather perhaps in evasions. Its morality has been
described as more negative than positive; but this is scarcely correct,
and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be fairer to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that it delights in telling <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to abstain
from doing evil, rather than in urging them to active exertions for the

But if there was no probability of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> existing separately from a

there be any agreement between the teaching of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and that of
the Brahmans, in regard to this important central dogma? The real fact
was that the divergence of the Buddhist doctrine from the Brahmanical,
as stated in the Upanishads, was not greater than was to be expected
from the difference of belief between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems in regard to the
existence of soul.

Plato, we know, held that souls ‘found their prisons in the same
natures’ at death, so that an effeminate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be re-born as a

source in Upadana (p. 103) and are continually combining, dissolving,

Sensation (_vedana_) of pain or pleasure, or of neither, arising from
contact of eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> with external objects.
3. Perception (_sañña_ = _sañjña_) of ideas through the same sixfold
contact. 4. Aggregate of formations (_sa?khara_ = _sa?skara_, i.e.
combination of properties or faculties or mental tendencies, fifty-two
in number, forming <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> character and derived from previous
existences; compare the similar sa?khara pl. at p. 102). 5.
Consciousness (_viñña?a_ = _vijñana_) or thought[51]. This fifth is the
most important. It is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> recognized by Buddhists.
Theoretically it perishes with the other Skandhas, but practically is
continued, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> its exact counterpart is reproduced in a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> body.

For although, when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> dies, all the five constituents of existence

is so instantaneous that it is equivalent to the continuance of the same
personality, pervaded by the same consciousness; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> each personality
is only really connected with the previous by the force of acts done and
character formed in each—such force operating through Upadana. In short,
to speak of transmigration of souls in Buddhism gives a wrong idea.
Metempsychosis with Buddhists resolves itself into continuous
metamorphosis or Palingenesis. For no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhist believes in the

different. It is this act-force (Karma), combined with Upadana,
‘clinging to existence’ (=abhi-nive?a in the Yoga II. 9), which is the
connecting link between each man’s past, present, and future bodies.

In its subtle and irresistible operation it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be compared to stored-up
chemical or electric energy. It is a force which continually creates and
re-creates the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> man, and perpetuates his personal identity through
separate forms, whether it compels him to ascend or descend in the scale
of being.

consciousness of any continuity of identity, amounts, after all, to
denial of continuous existence.

Be it observed, too, that the scale of existence is limited in Buddhism
to six classes of beings—gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts, and
dwellers in hell (p. 121). Transmigration is not extended, as in the
Brahmanical system, to plants, stocks, and stones; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be

Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was merely the last link in a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> chain of
corporeal forms, and he had been preceded by twenty-four Buddhas, who
were to previous ages of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> what he was to the present. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of these Buddhas was gifted with the faculty of recollecting his
previous personalities, and Gautama often gave an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of his own
former existences. The stories of about five hundred and fifty of his
births (Jatakas) are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> now daily repeated to eager listeners in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

full of puerilities.

The interchange of ideas between Brahmanism and Buddhism is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
exemplified not only by the twenty-five Buddhas, who correspond to the
fourteen Manus, or representative men, in each world-period (Antara),
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> by the birth-stories, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of which are mere modifications of
<span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> fables <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> current in India, while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> have been imported from
Buddhism into Sansk?it literature. They constantly remind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of similar
stories in the Pañca-tantra, Hitopade?a, Ramaya?a, and Maha-bharata. The
noteworthy point about the repeated births of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is, that
there appears to have been no Darwinian rise from lower to <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms;
but a mere jumble of metamorphoses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we find him born four times as
Maha-brahma, twenty times as Indra, once as a hare, eighty-three times
as an ascetic, fifty-eight as a king, twenty-four as a Brahman, once as
a gamester, eighteen times as a monkey, six as an elephant, eleven as a
deer, once as a dog, four times as a serpent, six as a snipe, once as a
frog, twice as a fish, forty-three times as a tree-god, twice as a pig,
ten times as a lion, four as a cock, twice as a thief, once as a
devil-dancer, and so on. He was <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> born as a woman, nor as an insect,
nor as a Preta, nor an inhabitant of hell (p. 119), and in all his
births he was a Bodhi-sattva (pp. 98, 135). And in all he suffered and
sacrificed himself for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of the world.

Here is the substance of an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of Gautama’s birth as a hare, <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
by himself (Cariya-Pi?aka I. 10, translated by Dr. Oldenberg):—

‘In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of my lives I was a hare living in a forest. I ate grass and did

Perhaps the best and most often recited Jataka is the last birth but

and of Don Quixote’s saying, ‘Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of his own works;’
and of Wordsworth’s, ‘The child is <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the man;’ and of
Longfellow’s, ‘Lives of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> all remind us, we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> ourselves
sublime.’

In short, we are the outcome of ourselves. Nor can ceremonies avail
aught, nor can devotion to personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> avail aught, nor can anything
whatever possess the slightest efficacy to save a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> from his own acts.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that Buddhism leaves the will unfettered; but surely fatalism
is taught when the force of one’s own deeds in previous births is held
to be irresistible.

The only creator, then, recognized by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists is Act-force. ‘My
action is the womb that bears me,’ <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the A?guttara Nikaya. It is this
Act-force that creates worlds. It is this Act-force, in conjunction with
Upadana (p. 109), that creates all beings in any of the six classes into
which they are divided—gods, men, demons, animals, ghosts, and the
dwellers in hell. We often talk of the force of a dead man’s acts—of his
being dead and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> speaking. It is this force which in Buddhism resists
death; for no force can ever be lost.

And what does the modern Positivist philosopher assert? He maintains
that both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> are resolved into their elements at death. The
only immortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of us consists in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds, words, thoughts,
and influences we leave behind us, to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> use of by our descendants
and improved on for the elevation of humanity. And the aggregate of
these, combined with the force of will, constitute, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the
Buddhist, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> strong enough to re-create not only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings but
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> material world.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that the force of Gautama’s own acts had constantly
re-created him through a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> chain of successive personalities,
terminating in the perfect Buddha, who has no further births to undergo.

Turn we now to that division of the Buddhist system which concerns
itself with the external universe, and seeks to explain its
constitution, form, and the various divisions of which it consists.

And here we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be careful to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> the peculiar views of Buddhism,
notwithstanding the large admixture of Brahmanical ideas.

For Buddhism has no cosmogony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the Sa?khya, Vedanta, and Vai?eshika.
Nor does it explain the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of the universe, in our sense. It only
concerns itself with cosmology, and it dissents from Brahmanical
cosmology in declining to admit the eternity of anything whatever,
except change or revolution or a succession of revolutions. Buddhism has
no Creator, no creation, no original germ of all things, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the
world, no personal, no impersonal, no supramundane, no antemundane
principle.

It <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> have been supposed that <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> Gautama denied the eternal
existence of either a personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> or of Spirit, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> at least have
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> eternal existence to matter.

But no; the only eternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are the Causality of Act-force and the
succession of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> and effect—the eternity of ‘Becoming,’ not of
‘Being.’

The Universe around us, with all its visible phenomena, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be
recognized as an existing entity, for we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> before our eyes evidence of
its actual existence. But it is an entity produced out of nonentity, and
destined to lapse again into nonentity when its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is fulfilled.

For out of nothingness it came, and into nothingness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> it return—to
re-appear again, it is true, but as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> Universe <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into being by
the accumulated force of its predecessor’s acts, and not evolved out of
any eternally existing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> or material germ of any kind.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that Universe after Universe is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a succession of
countless bubbles for ever forming, expanding, drifting onwards,
bursting and re-forming, each bubble owing its re-formation to the force
generated by its vanished predecessor. The poet Shelley <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have been

  Worlds on worlds are rolling ever
    From <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> to decay;
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the bubbles on a river,
    Sparkling, bursting, borne away. (Hellas.)

Or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> lotuses, for ever unfolding and then decaying, each decay
containing the germ of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> plant; or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an interminable succession
of wheels for ever coming into view, for ever rolling onwards,
disappearing and reappearing; for ever passing from being to non-being,
and again from non-being to being. It was this ceaseless rotation that
led to the wheel being adopted as the favourite symbol in Buddhism (p.
122).

Christianity recognizes in a very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> this ‘law of
circularity’ in the physical world, as the Rev. Hugh Macmillan has ably
pointed out.

As to the question from whom? or whence? or how? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> the original force
or impetus that started the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> movement, the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> hazarded no
opinion. He held this to be an inexplicable mystery—an insoluble riddle.
He confessed himself to be a thorough Agnostic. He saw <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but
countless cycles of causes and effects, and <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> undertook to explain
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> which <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> wheel in motion. It was not, then,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a deep significance that Gautama placed Ignorance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> in his
chain of Causation (p. 102. Note, however, the explanation <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> at p.
99).

After all, these Buddhistic speculations amount to little else than
Brahmanism stripped of some of its transcendental mysticism. We know,
for example, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Vedanta philosophy makes the Universe proceed
out of an eternal Illusion, or Ignorance associated with the impersonal
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Brahman, into which it is again absorbed.

Can it be affirmed, then, a Buddhist <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> say, that either this pure
impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> (or Ignorance) is virtually very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from pure
nothingness?

What <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the author of ?ig-veda X. 120?—

  In the beginning there was <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> naught nor aught,
  Then there was <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> sky nor atmosphere above.
  Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> darkness hid in darkness, gloom in gloom;

Then as to the vast periods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kalpas or ages, during which (as in
Brahmanism) constant Universes are supposed to appear, disappear, and
re-appear:—

a Buddhist Kalpa.

And what, in conclusion, is the existing Universe? Buddhist writers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>

morality, used no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> expressive of morality, as founded on the <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span>

Doubtless Buddhism deserves credit for laying stress on <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> belief,
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> words, <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> work, instead of on ceremonial rites; and on the
worship of Hindu gods; but it had its own idea of right. It urged
householders to abandon the world, or else to be diligent in serving its
monks for the working out of their own salvation; and while making
morality, meditation, and enlightenment its indispensable factors in
securing perfection, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> perfection consist in freedom from the

in working out this kind of perfection, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> before its

saints (Sa?gha).

We now turn to its fuller moral system, keeping this distinct from its
philosophy and metaphysics, and freely admitting that there are in
Buddhist morality <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> things, true, honourable, just, pure, lovely, and

It is fair to point out at the outset that Buddhist morality was not a
purely external matter. It divided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> into the outwardly correct and
internally sincere. The mere outwardly correct Buddhists <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> include
monks as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as laymen, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> standard of profession was
expected of monks. The internally sincere were the really earnest
seekers after perfection (monks and laymen), and were divided into four
classes, representing four conditions of the inner life, lower, higher,
still higher, and highest, culminating in perfect Saintship, Arhatship,
and Nirva?a (p. 132).

At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there was not <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> hope of saintship except through
celibacy and monkhood; for in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism the notion of <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
family-life was almost a contradiction in terms.

Of course the Buddhist moral code soon passed beyond the eightfold path
propounded by Gautama in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sermon (see p. 44), and Dr. Oldenberg
has shown that in the absence of a systematically arranged code, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
still trace out amid a confusion of precepts the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> leading duties of
external moral conduct (?ila), of internal mental concentration
(samadhi), and of acquiring <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> wisdom (pañña = prajña). Compare Dr.
Wenzel’s ‘Friendly Epistle,’ 53.

The five fundamental rules of moral conduct (?ila), or rather,
prohibitions, were promulgated very early:—

1. Kill not any living thing. 2. Steal not. 3. Commit not adultery. 4.
Lie not. 5. Drink not strong drink. These five, having reference chiefly
to one’s neighbour, were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the fivefold <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> _for all classes_,
including laymen. They were taken from Brahmanism, but in the vows of
the Sannyasi the fifth was not included. It was Buddhism probably that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> interdicted strong drink. It prohibited too what the Brahmans
allowed—killing for sacrificial purposes.

Five <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> of a more trivial character for monks (often <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in a
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> order, p. 78) were added:—

6. Eat no food, except at stated times. 7. Use no wreaths, ornaments, or
perfumes. 8. Use no high or broad bed, but only a mat on the ground. 9.
Abstain from dancing, singing, music, and worldly spectacles. 10. Own no
gold, or silver of any kind, and accept none (Maha-vagga I. 56). [This
Buddhist Decalogue <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be contrasted with the Mosaic Decalogue.]

All ten were binding on monks only, and for the third was then
substituted ‘be absolutely chaste.’

Sometimes not only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> five but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> eight were held to be
binding on laymen.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> was added in later times:—Never think or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that your own
religion is the best. <span class="t12 hoverable">Never</span> denounce the religion of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> (see p. 90).

Then, although only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> half of the eightfold path (p. 44) was
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be necessary for lay-brethren, the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> was for monks, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
had to observe the special practices already described (p. 76).

All gambling and games of chance were prohibited (Tevijja-Sutta II).
Compare Manu IX. 221-228.

Sometimes five renunciations are named:—of wife, of children, of money,
of life, of craving for existence in future births.

Then sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> (sometimes four) corrupting influences (asava =
asrava) are enumerated—of lust (kama), of life, of ignorance, (of
delusion.)

Most important to be got rid of are the ten fetters (sa?yojana, p. 45)
binding a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to existence:—

1. Belief in the existence of a personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> or Ego (sakkaya-di??hi);
2. Doubt (vicikitsa); 3. Ceremonial practices (silabbata = ?ila-vrata);
4. Lust or sensuality (kama); 5. Anger (pa?igha); 6. Craving for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in
a material <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> (rupa-raga) either on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in heaven; 7. Longing for
immaterial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (arupa-raga) in the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> heavens; 8. Pride (mana); 9.
Self-exaltation (auddhatya); 10. Ignorance. Of these, 1, 3, and 4, with
di??hi, ‘wrong belief,’ are the four constituents of Upadana, ‘clinging
to existence’ (p. 109).

The seven jewels of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> (p. 49) are—1. the five contemplations or
reflections; 2. the four <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> exertions (p. 50); 3. the four paths to
supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (p. 50); 4. the five moral forces (p. 50); 5. the
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> use of the five organs of sense; 6. the seven limbs of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(p. 50); 7. the eightfold path (p. 44).

The five above-named reflections are—1. on the thirty-two impurities of
the body; 2. on the duty of displaying <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> (Maitri) towards all beings;
3. on compassion for all who suffer; 4. on rejoicing with all who
rejoice; 5. on absolute indifference (upeksha) to joy or sorrow. These
contemplations (bhavana) in Buddhism <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of prayer. The last
is the highest. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a Sati-pa??hana (p. 49).

others; this is most important; 2. Virtue or moral conduct (?ila); 3.
Patience or tolerance (Kshanti); 4. Fortitude or energy (Virya); 5.
Suppression of desire (Nekkhamma = naishkamya), or, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to some,

which are added—7. <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> (Satya); 8. Steadfast resolution (Adhish?hana);
9. Good-will or kindness (Maitra); 10. Absolute indifference or
imperturbability or apathy (Upeksha), resulting in a kind of ecstatic
quietude.

This kind of memorial tabulation in lists of 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, etc., is of

‘By oneself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> done; by oneself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> injured; by oneself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

(Compare Manu IV. 240.)

‘Better than dominion over the earth, better than going to Heaven, or
having sovereignty over the worlds, is the attainment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> step

‘Not to commit evil, to accumulate merit by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds (kusalassa
upasampada), to purify the heart, this is the doctrine of the
Enlightened’ (165, 178, 183).

‘As a frontier town is guarded[52] <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> and without, so guard
thyself.’ (Dh. 315.)

‘He who holds back rising anger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a rolling chariot, him I call a
real driver; any other merely holds the reins.’ (Dh. 222. Compare Manu
II. 88.)

‘Let a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> overcome anger by gentleness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him overcome the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> by

VI. 47, 48.)

‘The fully enlightened finds no satisfaction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in heavenly pleasures;

‘One by one, little by little, moment by moment, a wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> frees

‘There is a treasure laid up in the heart, a treasure of charity,
purity, temperance, soberness. A treasure, secure, impregnable, that no
thief can steal; a treasure that follows after death. (Compare Manu IV.
241.) Universal science, all the perfections, supernatural knowledge,
supreme Buddhaship itself this treasure can procure.’ (Childers’
Nidhi-ka??a.)

The following are some of the blessed states described in the
Mahama?gala-sutta. They prove that Gautama required married <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to
discharge their duties faithfully.

‘The succouring of mother and father, the cherishing of child and wife,
and the following of a peaceful calling, this is the greatest blessing’
(ma?galam uttamam).

‘The giving alms, a religious life, aid rendered to relations, blameless
acts, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Reverence and humility, contentment and gratefulness, the hearing of
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> at the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> time, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Patience and lowly speech, association with religious men, recitation
of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> at the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> time, this is the greatest blessing.’

‘Self-mortification and chastity, discernment of the noble truths,
perception of Nirva?a, this is the greatest blessing.’

In the A?guttara (II. iv. 2) it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that no adequate return can be

kill, he was <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> to injure.

Then in the Rajovada Jataka we have the story of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ‘who

conquers anger by calmness, the wicked by goodness, the stingy by gifts,

Other precepts require a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to exercise charity and respect towards all
aged persons, teachers, servants, and animals. He was to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> an example
of self-sacrifice.

It is recorded of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> that on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> occasion he plucked out his

idea of sin, as displeasing to a <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> God, was connected with the
infraction of the moral code. Nor did a Buddhist always avoid harming
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> reverence for life.

for avoiding anger was that it was incompatible with that equanimity,
which ought to characterize <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who aimed at the extinction

commemorate the termination of a fatiguing journey, especially by
providing worn-out travellers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> themselves, with horses. The
missionaries pleaded their own poverty, but to their surprise were told
that they were only required to draw horses on paper, which were taken
to the edge of a precipice, thrown up into the air, and, <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>
formularies being recited, were carried <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> by the wind and changed

dead to the world. He is the Jivan-mukta, ‘emancipated living man,’ of

inner ear, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all thoughts, and recollection of previous

monastic life.

But of Arhats there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> grades:—

First, the simple Arhat (described above), who has attained perfection
through his own efforts and the doctrine and example of a supreme
Buddha, but is not himself such a Buddha, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> teach <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> how to

Secondly, and second in rank, but <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> above the simple Arhat, the
Pratyeka-Buddha or Solitary Saint, who has attained perfection for
himself and by himself alone, and not as a member of any monastic Order,
nor through the teaching of any supreme <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (except in some former
birth). This solitary hermit-like Arhat—a kind of concentration of
isolated or selfish sanctity—is symbolized by a rhinoceros. He does not
appear on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with a supreme Buddha, and has not the
same epithets (p. 23) applied to him.

Thirdly, the supreme <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> or <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> _par excellence_ (once a
Bodhi-sattva), who, having by his own self-enlightening insight attained
perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (sambodhi), and having, by the practice of the
transcendent virtues (p. 128) and through extinction of the passions and
of all desire for life, <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> entitled to that complete extinction of
bodily existence (pari-nirva?a), in which the perfection of all
Arhatship <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> end, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> delayed this consummation that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
the Saviour of a suffering world—not in the same manner as the God-sent
Saviour of Christianity, but by teaching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> how to save themselves.
This is the supreme Buddha, the founder of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> monastic Order,
immeasurably superior both to Pratyeka-Buddhas and to all mere Arhats.

He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of himself (Maha-vagga I. 6, 8),—‘I am the all-subduer
(sabbabhibhu); the all-wise; I have no stains; through myself I possess
knowledge; I have no rival (pa?ipuggalo); I am the chief Arhat—the
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> teacher; I alone am the absolutely wise (Sambuddha); I am the
Conqueror (Jina); all the fires of desire are quenched (sitibhuto) in
me; I have Nirva?a (nibbuto).’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> p. 42 of this volume.

This seems a marvellous assumption on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> claimed

held that its saints <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> surpass all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (Brahma only excepted).

Such supreme Buddhas, who are perfect knowers, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> perfect teachers

time.

Gautama is the fourth <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age (Bhadra-Kalpa). He was a
Kshatriya; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mythical predecessors—Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni,
and Ka?yapa—having been <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Brahmans. He is to be followed by the
fifth Buddha, Maitreya (a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> ‘full of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> towards all

memory after five thousand <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> (p. 181). In their previous existences
Gautama and his predecessors were, (see pp. 98, 112,) Bodhi-sattvas[53],
‘beings who have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (derived from intellect) for their essence,’

This coming <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> hereafter, an object of universal

Messiah or Saviour. Often, indeed, he is more honoured than Gautama
himself, because he is interested in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of things, as

Twenty-four mythical Buddhas (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> being Dipa?kara, ‘Light-causer’)
are held to have appeared[54] before Gautama in preceding cycles of
time. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> particulars about them are given, including their
birth-places, the length of their lives and their statures. Gautama
himself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have met some of them during his transmigrations.

Sometimes the last six of the twenty-four are reckoned with Gautama
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as constituting seven principal Buddhas[55], who seem to have
been grouped <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> to correspond with the Brahmanical seven Manus of
the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Kalpa. Usually, however, Gautama is held to be the last of
twenty-five Buddhas.

Clearly, then, the principal lines of Buddhist moral teaching all
converge to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> focus—to the perfected Arhat or rather to a still
brighter point of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> in the perfect <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> waiting for his reward—the
nectar of the eternal state of complete Nirva?a.

And this compels us to attempt some explanation of Nirva?a. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

Mokkha or Mutti, ‘deliverance,’ Nirodha, ‘cessation,’ Ta?hakkhaya
(t?ish?a-kshaya), ‘destruction of lust,’ Arupa, Khema, Kevala, Apavagga,
‘emancipation,’ Nibbuti (= nirv?iti), ‘quietude,’ Amata (Am?ita),
‘deathless nectar.’

What, then, is the proper definition of Nirva?a (Pali Nibbana)? In
venturing on an explanation of so controverted a term, I feel rather
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a foolhardy person walking barefoot over thorny ground.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is, that the term Nirva?a was not originated by Gautama. It
was an expression common to both Brahmanism and Buddhism, and most of
its synonyms such as moksha, apavarga, and nirv?iti are still common to
both. It was current in Gautama’s time, and certainly occurs in the
Maha-bharata, parts of which are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> antiquity.

In the celebrated episode of that poem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhagavad-gita[56], V. 24,
we find the following:—

‘That Yogi who is internally happy, internally satisfied and internally
illumined, attains extinction in the Supreme Being, and becomes that
Being’ (Yo ’nta?sukho ‘ntararamas tathantarjyotir eva ya?, | Sa Yogi
Brahma-nirva?a?[57] Brahma-bhuto ’dhigacchati).

The second point is that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be about as unreasonable to expect
that Nirva?a should always be explained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to restrict
Brahmanism and Buddhism—two most elastic, comprehensive, and Protean
systems, which have constantly changed their front to suit changing
circumstances and varying national peculiarities at <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> epochs and
in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> countries—to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hard and fast outline.

It is certainly singular that although the term Nibbana (Sansk?it
Nirva?a)—like some of the crucial theological terms of Christianity—has
led to endless discussions, it does not occur often in the Pali texts.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Arahattam, ‘Arhatship,’ is more common.

Nirva?a, of course, originally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> ‘the state of a blown-out flame.’
Hence its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is properly restricted to the complete
extinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chief fires[58] of lust, ill-will, and delusion,
and a total cessation of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> passions and desires[59], especially
of the desire for <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> existence (name and form).

Following on this is the state of release from all pain and from all
ignorance, accompanied by a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of profound rest—a state achieved by
all Arhats while still living in the world[60], and notably by the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at the moment when he attained Buddhahood, forty-five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
before his final Pari-nirva?a. Nirva?a then is not necessarily the
annihilation of all existence. It is the absence of kle?a (p. 124), as
in the Yoga system, and corresponds very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to the Brahmanical
Apavarga, described in the Nyaya, and defined by a commentator,
Vatsyayana, to be Sarva-du?kha-cheda (‘the cutting off of all pain’). In
short, it is Arhatship.

But besides Nirva?a we have the expression Pari-nirva?a. This is not
merely the blowing out of the fires of the passions but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the entire
cessation of re-births, with extinction of all the elements or seeds of
bodily existence. This took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> died or ‘passed away’
after innumerable previous deaths. Practically, however, in Buddhism the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> ordinary being amounts to this kind of Nirva?a; for, if
there is no recollection of any former state of existence in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span>
being created by Karma, what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> but utter personal
extinction?

Now with regard to the Nirva?a of Arhatship, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> can have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> in
contact with the natives of India in their own country, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
observing that for a genuine aristocratic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> to allow <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to any passion, to exhibit any emotion or enthusiasm, is
regarded as a proof of weakness.

We can easily understand, therefore, that when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> exhorted his
followers to strive after a wholly impassive condition, he addressed a
sympathetic audience.

<span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Long</span> before his exhortations were heard in India, his fellow-countrymen
held persons in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> respect who claimed to have entirely
suppressed their passions. The only peculiarity in Gautama’s teaching
was that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this object incumbent on all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists alike,

indicated to the eye by the usual attitude of the images which, after
Gautama’s death, were carved to represent him—an attitude of passionless
composure, and dignified calm.

to conceive.

I trust I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not shock my Indian friends if I illustrate this
condition by a comparison of my own drawn from the animal creation. In
crossing the Indian Ocean, when unruffled by the slightest breeze, I
have sometimes observed a jelly-fish floating on the surface of the
transparent water, apparently lifeless. The creature is evidently
<span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> asleep nor awake. It certainly is not thinking about anything,
and its consciousness is doubtful. All that can be affirmed about it is
that it seems to be drinking in the warm fluid in a state of lazy
blissful repose.

No Buddhist, at least, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> look at such a sight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being reminded
of this idea of Nirva?a—the idea of, so to speak, floating in perfect
repose and peace and cessation from all pain, and all work, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> all
thought, on a kind of ocean of half conscious, half unconscious
beatitude. It is not consciousness, <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> is it unconsciousness. It is
symbolized by a full-blown, perfectly formed lotus—a frequent emblem of
perfection—reposing on a calm mirror-like lake.

With regard to Pari-nirva?a[61]—the complete termination of migrations
and passing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> of all the elements of bodily existence—if this is to
be distinguished from the Brahmanical idea of absorption into an
impersonal spirit—whereby the Ego of personal identity is destroyed—it
is a distinction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> difference.

Strictly, however, in Buddhism the dissolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> leaves no

not properly described either as absorption into a void (?unya) or as
annihilation. It is simply the absolute termination of a series of
conscious bodily organizations. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself evaded dogmatic
definitions, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> probably have said:—it is not life, <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> is it

The apex of all the desires, the culminating point of all the ambition
of the most religiously-minded Buddhists of modern times, points to a

It only remains for me to caution those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be impressed with the
beauty of some of the precepts of the moral code and its theory of
perfection, as ending in Pari-nirva?a, against deducing therefrom too
optimistic an estimate of the Buddhist system. Buddhist morality is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
a showy edifice built on the sand. It is a thoroughly fair-weather
structure, incapable of standing against flood, storm, and tempest.

view of extinguishing one’s own.

It must, in short, be clearly understood that if any comparison be
instituted between Buddhism and Christianity in regard to the
self-abnegation, or self-sacrifice which each claims to inculcate, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> to be got rid of in Buddhism is not the selfishness condemned by
Christianity, but rather the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> of individuality—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> of

righteousness of the Buddhist is not the perfection of holiness by the
extinction of sin committed against God, but the perfection of
merit-making, with the view of earning happiness for himself in a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>

For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Buddhist is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a trader who keeps a ledger, with a regular

In conclusion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> enforce his own moral teaching in his own

replied to the following effect: ‘I do plough and sow and eat immortal

mind, the rein. Faith (saddha) in the doctrine is the seed I sow;

Buddhism. Nay, possibly some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> complain that I have not enlarged
sufficiently on the remarkable resemblance between <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> moral
precepts in the Buddhist code and in the Christian. I admit this
resemblance—I admit that both tell us:—not to <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> the world; not to
<span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> money; not to show enmity towards our enemies; not to do
unrighteous or impure acts—to overcome <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> by good, and to do to <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>

Nay, I admit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more:—I allow that some Buddhist precepts go beyond
the corresponding Christian injunctions. For Buddhism prohibits all
killing—even of animals and noxious insects. It demands total abstinence
from stimulating drinks—disallowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> moderation in their use. It
excludes all who aim at perfect sanctity from the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> estate of
matrimony. It bids a man, if he strives after perfection, abandon the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and lead a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of monkhood. In fine, its morality is essentially
a monkhood-morality. It enjoins total abstinence, because it dares not
trust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings to be temperate.

It seems to
speak to him thus:—Thy Creator wills to trust <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> and to be trusted by

to natural desires; He simply bids <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thee</span> keep them <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> bounds, so that

Yes, the grand difference between the morality of Buddhism and the
morality of Christianity is not in the letter of the precepts, but in
the principle and motive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to bear on their application.

Buddhism says:—Be righteous by yourselves, and through yourselves, and
for the getting rid of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in yourselves. Christianity says:—Be
righteous through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God’s gift of eternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in His Son. In
a word, Buddhism founds its morality on self. Christianity founds its
morality on Christ.

                              LECTURE VII.
        _Changes in Buddhism and its disappearance from India._


In the preceding Lectures I have confined myself chiefly to the
consideration of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> _true Buddhism_ as taught by its
Founder and developed by his immediate followers and disciples during
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries of its existence in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its
birth, India.

To attempt an explanation of all the subsequent phases of Buddhism
would, as I have before stated, require the command of unlimited time.
All I can hope to accomplish in the concluding Lectures is to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a
very general idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the changes Buddhism underwent before
it died out in India, and of its corruptions in some of the countries
bordering on India and in North-eastern Asia.

And I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add that those who desire correct views on this subject, ought
not to trust to mere inferences and theories founded on a critical
perusal of the so-called Sacred Books of the Buddhists. For it is
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any practical experience of what Buddhism has
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> in modern times—I mean such an experience as can only be gained
by residing or travelling in countries where Buddhism now prevails—the
mere study of its ancient scriptures is likely to be misleading.

At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> book-knowledge is indispensable, and it is essential to
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> to the study of later Buddhism a scholarlike acquaintance with
Sansk?it and Pali. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Tibetan ought to be added. Nor
ought the inquirer to be ignorant of the science of comparative
religion, seeing that the principles of that science <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> difficult questions.

For example, a student of comparative religion will be prepared to
expect that all religious systems will diverge more or less from their
original type in the hands of enthusiastic disciples, who are ever
inclined to amplify their master’s teaching and to explain it
differently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to each man’s peculiar temperament and mental
bias, until in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> the original deposit of simple doctrine becomes
overlaid with layer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> layer of adventitious matter.

Nor will he be surprised to find that the tendency of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> religious
movement is towards deterioration and disintegration. Nor will it appear
strange to him that the chief conservative force is antagonism. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
goes on disagreements <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the followers of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> leader seem to be
inevitable, and always lead to sectarian divisions and subdivisions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span>
it is this opposition of religious parties that usually operates to
mitigate the worst extremes of corruption, and tends to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> about
re-forming movements.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> the progress of Christianity—as history shows too well—furnishes
illustrations of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of deterioration, disintegration, and
re-formation. At all events, it is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that no study of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span>
Testament is likely to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> idea of the varying condition of the
Christian religion as exhibited at the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> parts of
the world.

But here it is important to caution the student of religions against
forcing a comparison between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems of doctrine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Christianity
and Buddhism, which are radically and essentially opposed to each other.

The unchristianlike incrustations and divisions which have marred the
original teaching of the Head of our religion exist _in spite_ of
Christianity. They are not the result of any development of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
principles; whereas, on the contrary, the corruptions and schisms of
Buddhism are the natural and inevitable outcome of its own root-ideas
and fundamental doctrines.

In proof of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us revert for a moment to the insight we have
gained into the origin of Buddhism.

It will be seen that the most remarkable feature of the Buddha’s
teaching, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as it has been stated in the preceding Lectures, was
that he altogether ignored the existence in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of any
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspirations, affections, or instincts <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than or distinct
from the natural aspirations, affections, and instincts of humanity; and
of any force outside of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> capable of aiding a man’s own
efforts in his struggle for salvation. Not that he reviled, or poured
contempt on the religion prevalent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> his fellow-countrymen, but that
he <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in his system for an external Ruler and Controller of
the Universe, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have stultified his own teaching had he
acknowledged a Supreme Creator, guiding and upholding all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> by His
will, and always at <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> to co-operate with His creatures and listen to
their supplications.

If it were possible, in short, to condense into a categorical statement
the scattered utterances of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> teaching was rarely dogmatic, we

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that he deserves commendation for having substituted moral

peculiar stoical philosophy had no other object than the removal of the

It is admitted, too, that its moral precepts were of a high order; but
it promised <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> aid in observing them, it supplied him with no

states of corporeal existence, and it provided no remedy in <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> his
attempts to obey its injunctions ended in failure. How, indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> it

Furthermore, it was guilty of the inconsistency of bidding a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> cherish

wife and children, and setting before himself, as his final goal, a
condition of absolute indifference and inactivity.

What, therefore, I am at <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> concerned to point out is that, if the
essential doctrines of primitive Buddhism were of the character <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
summarized, a rebound from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> extreme to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> became inevitable, and
that such a reaction was due to the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the original teaching
of its Founder. In point of fact it was not a development that took
place, but a recoil—like the recoil of a spring held down for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> by

working of the eternal instincts of humanity, which insisted on making
themselves felt notwithstanding the unnatural restraint to which the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had subjected them; so that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> doctrine he taught developed by
a kind of irony of fate into a complete contradiction of itself.

Buddhism, we know, started with the doctrine that all idea of marriage,
or of happy home-life, was to be abandoned by wise men—by all who aimed
at becoming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists (in direct contradistinction, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> note, to

Church when He gave the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sign of His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> commission at a
marriage ceremony).

What, then, followed on the Buddha’s original unnatural teaching in
regard to marriage?

Of course an immediate result was that, although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the

lead a celibate life, the rule against marriage was admitted to be
inapplicable to the majority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings living in the world. The
mass of the people, in short, were necessarily offenders against the
primary <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of Buddhism. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> lay-Buddhists, they were not
‘wise men’ in the Buddhist <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term (pp. 86, 88). There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> against marriage was soon relaxed. It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that at the

And <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> worse than
this, Buddhism ultimately allied itself with Tantrism or the worship of
the female principle (?akti), and under its sanction encouraged the
grossest violations of decency and the worst forms of profligacy.

It was the same in regard to the unnatural vow of poverty. Monasteries
and Lamaseries now possess immense revenues, and monks are often wealthy
men.

Then again, what resulted from the Buddha’s ignoring the existence of a
God, and telling his disciples to abstain from depending on any Being
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> become?

can he <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> his affections on a blank or an abstraction. And so, in spite
of the Buddha’s teaching, his followers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> act on their own

a personal Creator knowable and lovable by themselves, and knowing and
loving His creatures. Nay, they ultimately converted the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself
into the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> he denied, calling him ‘The chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of all the gods’
(Devatideva).

Again, what was the effect of the Buddha’s leading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to believe that

from within, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was competent to think out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Of course the result was that the generality of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who shrank from the
effort of thinking out <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> for themselves, and were wholly destitute
of any faculty for doing so, insisted on believing in a revelation from
an external power, and ended in attributing infallibility to the
Buddha’s own teaching, and worshipping the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Buddhism—as a visible
embodiment of their deceased teacher—with all the ardour of enthusiastic
bibliolatrists.

Furthermore, what followed on the Buddha’s denying that any prayer,
<span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> earnest, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> have any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to modify the operation of natural

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> longed for some <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of supplication to a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> power,
and so the Buddha’s disciples not only composed prayer-formularies, but
invested the mere letters and syllables of such forms with an efficacy
which no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of religionists has ever <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of attributing to
prayer of any kind.

They not only repeated mystical sentences, which were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> prayers,

of the doctrine that any benefit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> accrue to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings from
religious services conducted by regularly ordained priests, and of his
instituting in their stead an <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks, who were little better
than a community of drones, contributing <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> to the wealth of the
world, doing <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> of any utility to any one, and taught to regard
inaction as the path of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> wisdom?

Naturally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> craved for <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> helpers, guides, and intercessors,
and so by degrees these very monks conducted elaborate religious
services, and a complicated hierarchy was organized in Tibet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more
intricate and far-reaching in its ramifications than that of the modern
Romish Church.

And once more, what resulted from the Buddha’s objection to provide
visible images and material objects of worship, with a view to stimulate
devotion or aid meditation?

Of course concrete and objective Buddhism of some kind became a
necessity. It became essential to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> concessions to the weakness and
infirmity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> nature, which required external aids, and declined to
be devoted to an ideal void, or to meditate on a pure abstraction. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
the Founder of Buddhism himself seems to have felt, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> see,
that his hold on the memory of his followers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> depend on their
venerating <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> objects and symbols after his death. Unhappily for
the purity of Buddhism, but quite in conformity with the inveterate
tendencies of humanity, the Buddha’s disciples pushed veneration of
external objects to an extreme. They were not contented with mere
reverence shown to the relics of the Buddha’s burnt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the shrines
containing them. They worshipped the tree under which he attained
Buddhahood, the seat on which he sat, the prints of his feet, his shadow
supposed to be impressed on rocks, the utensils he used, the books
containing the Law, the wheel which symbolized both the propagation and
the character of his doctrine, and finally bowed down before carved
representations of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and images of all kinds. It is remarkable
that in Buddhist countries idols are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more numerous than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> any
other idolatrous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the world.

Lastly, what resulted from the Buddha’s teaching that the ultimate <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span>
to which men’s efforts ought to be directed was Nirva?a—that is, the
total extinction of all <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> existence and personal identity?

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> instinctively recoiled from utter self-annihilation, and
so the Buddha’s followers ended in changing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> idea of Nirva?a and
converting it from a condition of non-existence into a state of hazy
beatitude in celestial regions, while they encouraged all men—whether
monks or laymen—to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of dreamy bliss in heaven, and not total
extinction of life, the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of all their efforts.

But it was not only this natural and inevitable recoil to the opposite
extreme that ultimately <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about an entire change in primitive
Buddhism. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be taken into account.

We have already explained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the tie which bound Buddhism to
Brahmanism, from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which Gautama sat as a disciple at the
feet of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> philosophers Udraka and A?ara (p. 29). Now, although
this tie was soon loosened, and although the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> struck out a line of
his own, and a separation took place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems stood on so
<span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> common ground that they were always ready to draw <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> again.

At all events, it is probable that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> system <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> expelled the other,
and that the constant attrition and contact which took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between
Brahmanism and Buddhism, led to a considerable splitting up of the
original fabric of Buddhism, involving, of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> divisions and
subdivisions of Buddhistic thought, some of which were closely allied to
the later developments of Brahmanical philosophy.

In the Sarva-dar?ana-sa?graha four principal sects of Buddhism are
enumerated, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have taken root early on Indian soil.

These four were the Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Madhyamika, and Yogacara.
Of these the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> with their subdivisions[63] were realistic, and
were established—though not perhaps thoroughly formulated and
systematized—in very early times, <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before the council of Kanishka;
while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> later schools are described as idealistic, the Madhyamika
being a Buddhistic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the Vedanta philosophy, and the Yogacara
agreeing generally with the Yoga system.

<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> there is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> evidence that Buddhism developed in India a greater
number of schools and phases of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> than Brahmanism itself. Some
authorities enumerate eighteen divisions (corresponding perhaps to the
eighteen original disciples, pp. 47-73) which existed in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Kanishka’s
time—that is, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> century of our era, while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> specify
thirty-two; and in the fourth century we find the Chinese traveller
Fa-hien (p. 160) making allusion to as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> as ninety-six (Dr. Legge’s
translation, p. 62).

We <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> wonder then that the author of the Sarva-dar?ana-sa?graha
expressed himself in rather strong language to the following effect:—

‘Though the venerated <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> be the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> teacher, his disciples are
manifold; just as when the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has set, the thief and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> doers,
the theological student and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> understand that it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span>
about their occupations, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their several inclinations.’

Yet, after all, it was chiefly in the North, and in consequence of the
council held by Kanishka, India’s greatest Buddhist <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> after A?oka[64]
(see p. 69), that the original features of Buddhism underwent the
greatest change and became overlaid with coating after coating of
extraneous matter. It was there, in Northern regions, in the valley of
the Indus, that the Protean system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-yana arose, and grew, by
the operation of the usual laws of accretion, conglomeration,
disintegration, and reintegration, into a congeries of heterogeneous
doctrines, including the worship of Bodhi-sattvas, deified saints, and
personal gods.

Naturally the adherents of this wider method spoke disparagingly of the
simpler system prevalent in the South, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> sacred books were the
Tri-pi?aka of Ceylon written in the ancient vernacular (Pali). That
system they designated Hina-yana, ‘the defective method,’ not denying
<span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> that their own enlarged system grew out of and included the
simpler one.

There arose, too, a third method, or ‘vehicle’ of salvation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the
middle method’ (Madhyama-yana). This, however, is not so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> known,
and, being a compromise between the other two, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> gained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
adherents, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is still recognized in Tibet—the Tibetans often
speaking of Tri-yana, or ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> vehicles.’

At all events, it is only necessary for practical purposes to recognize
the distinction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> and Little Vehicle—the Maha-yana[65] and
the Hina-yana. And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be stated generally that the inhabitants of
Nepal, Tibet, China, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Japan have always shown a
preference for the Maha-yana, or ‘Great Vehicle,’ while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of
Ceylon, Burma, and Siam have always preferred the ‘Little Vehicle.’

At the same time, it is important to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> that while the Buddhists of
Northern countries are supposed to be disciples of the Maha-yana or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Way</span> of Salvation, the Buddhism of each Northern country differs
greatly from that of the other, and that the countries nearest to India
have still further complicated the Maha-yana system by adopting mystical
doctrines, and introducing magic and other practices supposed to aid in
the acquisition of supernatural powers.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that, although the Maha-yana or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>

<span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about in Buddhism will <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> more evident by referring to the
narratives of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> well-known Buddhist travellers from China.

Buddhism was introduced into China between 58 and 75 of our era[66], but
it was not till <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> later that Chinese pilgrims visited India—the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Buddhism.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> traveller of whom we have any record was a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Chinese
Buddhist monk named Fa-hien, who <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out on a pilgrimage to India about
the year 399 of our era, with the definite object of searching for and
carrying back to China complete copies of the Vinaya or Rules of
discipline for the Order. He wrote a very simple and straightforward
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of his travels[67]—which lasted for fourteen years—and of his
visits to all the spots in India held most sacred by Buddhists. He was
followed by a Chinese traveller of less mark, named Sang Yun, who
started about 518 A.D., and seems to have ended his journey at Peshawar,
or at least not to have penetrated <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> further South. Peshawar, we
know, was a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Buddhist centre, and there was a fine Stupa there,
containing the alms-bowl of Buddha. Then after <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> interval a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
more celebrated Chinese pilgrim named Hiouen Thsang[68] started for
India (A.D. 629-644). The narrative of his travels for about fifteen
<span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> is perhaps the best <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> and most commonly quoted of the three.
In Chang Yueh’s preface[69] to these travels Hiouen Thsang is described
as ‘a Doctor of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Pi?akas, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have translated 657
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> from the original Sansk?it. In all the districts through which he
journeyed he learnt the dialects and investigated the deep secrets of
religion.’

All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> travellers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> information in regard to the prevalence of
Buddhism in India up to the seventh century of our era, and the
narratives of two—Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang—are invaluable for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span>
they throw on the changes which Buddhism underwent in the interval of
their travels. Here and there the pilgrims exaggerate, especially when
they venture on numerical statistics or write from hearsay; but on the
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> their accounts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be accepted, and we learn that Hiouen Thsang
<span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> some monasteries in ruins which were flourishing in Fa-hien’s
time, and that the Maha-yana had supplanted the earlier <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism, or rather co-existed with it in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> parts of the South as

And this brings us face to face with the greatest change of all—the
total dying out of Buddhism in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of its origin. How is it to be
accounted for that no adherents of either the greater or lesser Buddhist
systems—of either the Maha-yana or Hina-yana—are to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in India at
the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> moment?

The problem is difficult of solution, and I can only offer a few
suggestions for its elucidation.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, I think it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be confidently asserted that the
disappearance of Buddhism from India was a very gradual process, and
unattended by any serious or violent religious revolution.

We have already alluded to the tolerant, liberal, and eclectic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
which has characterized Buddhism ever <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the period of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
promulgation at Benares.

Such toleration of the doctrines and ideas of co-existing systems had
its advantages, especially in the early stages of the Buddhistic
movement. It certainly had a prophylactic effect in warding off violent
attacks, and helped to promote the diffusion of Buddhism throughout the
numerous countries to which it ultimately spread. In India itself, as we
have already seen, Buddhism was <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> aggressive or combative. Its motto
everywhere was persuasion and conciliation. Composure, tranquillity, and
absence of acrimony were stamped on all its features. The very
foundation on which it was reared—the very establishment of a celibate
monastic Order, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was to be
propagated—had in it something altogether agreeable to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and
usages of Brahmanism.

We have seen, too, that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> took care to show his respect for
Brahmanical traditions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> while promulgating a philosophical theory
and preaching doctrines opposed to all sacerdotalism, priestly
privileges, supernatural revelation, and Vedic ceremonial.

It does not, of course, follow that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher, to whom the
majority of Asiatic races have for centuries looked as their chosen
example, had not the courage of his opinions, and was not competent to
fill the rôle of a religious reformer.

The real fact was that he was too wise to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> any open crusade
against inveterate customs and ideas. The peculiar calm of an Indian
atmosphere, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> occasionally disturbed by political storms sweeping
from distant regions, has rarely been stirred by violent religious
antagonisms. The various currents of Hindu religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> have flowed
peacefully side by side, and reformers have generally done their <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
quietly. As for Gautama, there can be little doubt that his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> career
was stamped with the impress of his early surroundings, and that he
imbibed his tolerant ideas from the Brahmanism in which he had been
trained.

It has been usual to blame the Brahmans for their arrogant
exclusiveness, but their arrogance has been rather shown in magnifying
their own caste-privileges and carrying them to an extravagant pitch,
than in preventing any discussion of their own dogmas, or in resenting
any dissent from them.

The very essence of Brahmanism was tolerance. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of opinion was
admissible under a system which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> person and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> object in
existence manifestations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Being, Brahma.

The only delicate ground, on which it was dangerous for any reformer to
tread, was caste. The only unpardonable sin was infringement of
caste-rules. Nor was any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> tempted to adopt the rôle of a violent
agitator, when all were free to express any opinion they liked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
hindrance, provided they took care to abstain from any act of
interference with caste-privileges.

It does not appear, in short, that the preachers of either Buddhism, or
Vaish?avism, or ?aivism, or ?aktism, or of any <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of these sectarian
systems, ever incurred the special animosity of the Brahmans or of each
other, or ever indulged in very violent denunciations of each other’s
religious doctrines.

In real truth, these systems of doctrine were all evolved out of
Brahmanism. They were, therefore, not only tolerated by Brahmanism, but
accepted as the inevitable outcome of its own pantheistic creed.

No doubt each received at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> a strong stamp of individuality from its
founder, marking it off from other systems, but with the lapse of <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
the deeper shades of difference grew fainter. Then it became a question
which should <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> merged in the other. In such a competition between
rival systems Buddhism had less chance of holding its own than either
Vaish?avism or ?aivism; for its root-ideas—as we have seen—were not
rooted in the eternal instincts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> nature.

Buddhism, in fact, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> have maintained itself in India till the
twelfth or thirteenth century of our era, had it not gradually, and to a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent through interaction with Vaish?avism and ?aivism, dropped
its unnatural pessimistic theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and its unpopular atheistic
character, and accommodated itself to those systems.

But Buddhism in parting with its ultra-pessimism and its atheistic and
agnostic ideas, lost its chief elements of individuality and its chief
independent stand-point.

Vaish?avism, on the other hand, was quite alive to its own interests,
and had an eye to the spread of its own doctrines. It took care to adopt
all the popular features of Buddhism. It vied with Buddhism in
inculcating universal love, toleration, liberality, benevolence, and
abstinence from injury. It preached equality, fraternity, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in
some cases the abolition of caste distinctions. It taught a succession
of incarnations or rather descents (Avatara[71]) of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> (as Buddhism taught a succession of Buddhas), and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> adopted
the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the incarnations of Vish?u.

This, indeed, is the best explanation of what has happened at Puri in
Orissa, where a temple once dedicated to Gautama Buddha, and supposed to
contain a relic of his burnt body, was afterwards dedicated to the
Jagannath <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of K?ish?a and supposed to enshrine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his bones, and
where low-caste and high-caste both eat <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> the food cooked in the
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of that popular god.

The same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of the interaction which took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between
Buddhism and ?aivism; for ?aivism, of course, was quite as bent on the
propagation of its own creed as other systems were. It vied with
Buddhism in encouraging abstract meditation, and although it had less
sympathy than Vaish?avism had with that system, it approached in some
respects so closely to its rival, that when Buddhism disappeared from
India, images of Gautama were converted into representations of ?iva
seated in profound contemplation.

Ultimately, the interaction between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> systems proceeded to such
a point that each was influenced and modified by the other; each learnt
something, or adopted some practice from the other.

It was thus, too, that ?aktism, i. e. the worship of energy or force
(?akti), identified with ?iva’s consort, was imported into Buddhism; its
doctrine of the self-evolution of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> from Prak?iti having <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
that harmonized with the Buddhist theory of the origin of the Universe.
Thus, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Tantrism in its worst forms became intermixed with
Buddhistic practice.

Enough, then, has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to justify the assertion that Buddhism was
not forcibly expelled from India by the Brahmans. It simply in the
end—possibly as late as the thirteenth century of our era—became blended
with the systems which surrounded it, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the process of blending was

their religious duties, and to prosecute the study of philosophy, law,
and science in literary ease. It is probable that if disputes and
disagreements <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> burning questions occurred, they rarely led to
serious conflicts, and were not general throughout India, but confined
to particular localities; and I think it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be safely affirmed that if
Buddhism was ever anywhere persecuted, it <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> anywhere persecuted in
return.

I myself was <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> struck in a visit I paid to Ellora in the Nizam’s
territory by the evidence I there saw of the friendly tolerance which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have prevailed between Brahmans, Buddhists, and Jains. Brahmanical,
Buddhist, and Jaina caves are there seen side by side, and their inmates
no doubt lived on terms of fairly friendly tolerance, <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> as the
members of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan communions live in
Europe at the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> at Benares, the stronghold of Brahmanism, I witnessed similar
proofs of amicable mutual intercourse, and at Nasik—the Benares of
Western India—the proximity of the Buddhist caves and ruined monasteries
which I visited, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> it abundantly clear that Brahmans and Buddhists
agreed to differ and to avoid serious quarrels.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> nevertheless be admitted, that in the extreme South of India,
and perhaps eventually at Benares and a few other strongholds of
Brahmanism, the difference between the systems became so accentuated as
to lead to grievous conflicts. Whether blood was shed it is impossible
to prove; but it is alleged, with some degree of probability, that
violent crusades against Buddhism were instituted by Kumarila and
?a?kara—two well-known Southern Brahmans noted for their bigotry—in the
seventh and eighth centuries of our era. It does not appear, however,
that they were very successful either in the conversion or extermination
of Buddhists.

It may, I think, be confidently affirmed that what ultimately happened
in most parts of India was, that Vaish?avas and ?aivas crept up softly
to their rival and drew the vitality out of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by close and
friendly embraces, and that instead of the Buddhists being expelled from
India, Buddhism gradually and quietly lost itself in Vaish?avism and
?aivism. In fact, by the beginning of the thirteenth century very little
Buddhism remained on Indian soil. In a philosophical drama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the
Rise of the Moon of Knowledge’ (Prabodha-candrodaya), written probably
about the twelfth century, the approaching triumph of Brahmanism over
Buddhism is clearly indicated; for the Buddhist and other heretical
sects are represented as belonging to the losing side.

Yet, after all, it is scarcely correct to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that Buddhism ever wholly
died <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in India. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> perished there, but its <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
survived, and its sacred places remain to this day. Its ruined temples,
monasteries, monuments, and idols are scattered everywhere, while some
of these have been perpetuated and adopted by those later phases of
Hinduism which its own toleration helped to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> into existence.

At all events it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be safely affirmed that the passing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> of the

                             LECTURE VIII.
             _Rise of Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism._


In the preceding Lecture we have endeavoured to show generally how
Buddhism was evolved out of Brahmanism, how it flourished side by side
with Brahmanism, and how after a chequered career and protracted
senility in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of its birth—lasting for at least fifteen
centuries[77]—it ultimately merged its individuality in Vaish?avism and
?aivism, or, in other words, disappeared and became lost in a composite
system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hinduism.

We have now to trace more closely the gradual sliding of a simple
agnostic and atheistic creed, into a variety of theistic and
polytheistic conceptions.

We have already seen how the expansion of the Hina-yana into the
Maha-yana became an inevitable result of the Buddha’s own teaching—in
other words, how a rebound from atheism to theism was as unavoidable as
the return swing of a heavy pendulum. We need only repeat here that it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not have been otherwise, when a teacher, who <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> claimed to be
more than a man, attempted to indoctrinate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> followers with
principles opposed to the inextinguishable instincts and eternal
intuitions of humanity.

In fact the teachers of the Maha-yana school were not slow to perceive
that, if Buddhism was to gain any hold over the masses, it was essential
that it should adapt itself to their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> needs. It became imperatively
necessary, as a simple preservative measure, to convert a cold
philosophical creed, based on an ultra-pessimistic theory of existence,
into some sort of belief in the value of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as worth living. And
if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was not to be an invariable current of misery it followed that
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be some sort of faith in a superintending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>
controlling that life, and interesting Himself in Man’s welfare.

Unfortunately, having once advanced beyond definite limits, the more
progressive teachers <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> it impossible to draw the line at any <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
point.

No doubt the theistic movement began by simple saint-worship—that is, by
veneration for the extinct <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as for a perfect saint. This was
accompanied by homage offered to his relics and to various memorials of
his person.

Then mere veneration and homage led to actual worship, and the Buddha,
who from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> his own perfect humanity an essential
principle of his teaching, became elevated to a pinnacle <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> above
humanity and converted into a veritable god.

Next, it is easy to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that a further development of the theistic
movement became inevitable.

For <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it was only natural that in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> some of the more
eminent of the Buddha’s followers should <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> almost equally revered
with himself. It was not, however, till some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> that
they received any homage resembling that accorded to their Master.

It was then that, instead of being <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of as extinct, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
the orthodox Buddhist doctrine, they were continually elevated in the
imagination of their admirers to heavenly regions of beatitude.

Of course this constant increase of saint-worship tended to <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> by
degrees in a mass of theistic and polytheistic conceptions.

And polytheism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not prevail in Eastern countries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its usual
reverse side—polydemonism; and polydemonism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not prevail <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
its usual adjuncts of mysticism and magic. And all of these again
entailed idolatry, relic-worship, fetish-worship, and various other
gross superstitions.

Such was the natural termination of the process of degeneration. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us
now trace it more in detail.

And in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be forgotten that Gautama himself
seems to have foreseen this result.

He seems to have been quite aware of the ineradicable tendency inherent
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings, impelling them to elevate their saints
and heroes to the position of gods. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> took pains to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> his
beloved disciple and cousin Ananda understand that the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> embodied in
the Dharma or <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> which he had taught, was all that ought to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> his

Accordingly we learn from ancient inscriptions that for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

Buddhists was the Law—that is, the precepts, rules, and ordinances
propounded by Gautama himself—many of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been committed to
writing in early times, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> oral transmission was at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the usual
rule, as it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Brahmans.

In time, however, the interconnexion between Brahmanism and Buddhism,
and the tendency to group sacred objects in triads[78], which showed
itself very early in Hindu religious <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> and mythology, seems to
have led to the idea of a corresponding triple arrangement of venerated
objects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Buddhists. Hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> precious things—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> jewels (_tri-ratna_), or the ‘three Holies[79]’—came <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to
be held in honour and then actually worshipped; a kind of personality
being accorded to all three, very similar to that supposed to belong to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> of the Hindu Pantheon.

This triad of personalities consisted of (1) the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, that is
to say, Gautama Buddha, or the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age of the world;
(2) his Dharma or Law, that is, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and doctrine of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
personified, or so to speak incarnated and manifested in a visible <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
after his Pari-nirva?a; and (3) his Sa?gha or <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in a
manner personified—that is, embodied in a kind of ideal impersonation or
collective unity of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> disciples.

This last word, Sa?gha, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> in Sansk?it ‘a collection’ or
‘assemblage,’ is sometimes, as we have already seen (p. 85), very
unsuitably rendered by the expression ‘Buddhist Church.’ It simply
denotes ‘the collective <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Buddhist monks;’ that is to say, the
entire monastic fraternity, comprising in its widest <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
assemblage of monks, Arhats, Pratyeka-Buddhas, Bodhi-sattvas, perfected
Buddhas and not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> perfected saints of all classes, whether on the

carefully borne in mind—the still vaster community of living persons
constituting the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Buddhist laity.

These three, then,—the Buddha, his Law, and his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks,—passed
into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> personifications of early theistic Buddhism,
commonly <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Buddhist Triad.

Hence we find that the Khuddaka-pa?ha or ‘lesser readings[80]’ of the
fifteen divisions of the Khuddaka-nikaya (p. 63) begins thus:—

‘I <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> my trust in the Buddha, in the Law, in the Order’ (repeated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

When Fa-hien was on his return home and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> peril at sea, he
committed his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to the protection of the Sa?gha, saying:—‘I have

supernatural power, return from my wanderings and reach my

And again, on ending his travels, he gratefully acknowledged that he had
been guarded in his perils by the dread <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the ‘three honoured

the Bharhut Stupa. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the simple expression of

current in Ceylon. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that images of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> are now common
in that country, and while travelling there I saw numbers of persons
offering homage and flowers to these images. But no prayer was addressed
to them, and I noticed no visible representations of the personified <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span>
or Sa?gha[82].

Nor, when I was at the Buddhist monastery near Darjiling, did I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> any

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> so-called ‘Holies’ was a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> staff with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> prongs, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
the Indian Tri-?ula.

It seems clear, therefore, that while, in process of time, images of
Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> were multiplied everywhere—and, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> see, in

were <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> common, and <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> rarely found, except <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Northern
Buddhists. Those images of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> which I have examined are in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
of a man[83] with four arms and hands, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of which are folded in

rosary[84].

Sometimes, however, the representation of a <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> alone is held to be a
sufficient symbol of the Law.

The Sa?gha, on the other hand, is generally symbolized by the image of a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> arms and hands, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of which, as in the images of Buddha,
rests on the knees and the other holds a lotus.

And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be observed here that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> images of the Buddha, the

sometimes the other. This circumstance has led scholars to speak of what
it is the fashion to term a Buddhist trinity; but in real fact <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span>
Buddhism nor Brahmanism has any trinity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term,
for although Buddhists claim a kind of tri-unity for their triad, and

It appears, in fact, that the earliest Buddhist worship was exactly what
<span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have been expected to follow on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of a religious Reformer
and author of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> system. It was merely the natural expression of deep
reverence for the founder of Buddhism, his doctrine, and the collective
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of his disciples.

So simple a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of worship, however, did not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> satisfy the
devotional aspirations of the Buddha’s followers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the sacred
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of pure Buddhism.

The mere offering of homage, either to a system of Law, or to a
community of living monks or to departed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> saints—even <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> their

satisfied the needs of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in times of peace and prosperity. Under other
conditions it broke down. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> offer no shelter and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> no help
amid the storms and tempests of life. Hence the development of the later
phases of the Maha-yana system, the chief feature of which was a marked
change in the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> attached to the term ‘Bodhi-sattva.’

This change will be better understood if we go back to what has already
been mentioned (at p. 98). We have before explained that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
the original theory of Buddhism, a Bodhi-sattva is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
(derived from self-enlightening intellect) for his essence; that is, he
is a being who through all his bodily existences is destined in some
final existence to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Buddha, or self-enlightened man. Until his
final birth, however, a Bodhi-sattva is a being in whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
is rather latent and undeveloped than perfected. Gautama had been a
Bodhi-sattva of this character (see p. 134), the merit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> actions
(Karma) in each of his countless previous existences (see p. 109) had
been transmitted to succeeding corporeal forms, till in the state

Bodhi-sattva in the Tushita <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (see p. 120). There he continued
until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> for him to be born on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> of the
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age, when he entered the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side of his mother in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
a white elephant (p. 23)[85].

And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be repeated here that the white elephant, as something rare
and beautiful of its kind, was simply symbolical of the perfect
Arhatship which he was destined to achieve in the ensuing birth.

Born, then, at last as the child Gautama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of ?uddhodana, and
purified by a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> observance of the six transcendent virtues (p. 128),
he ultimately attained to perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and Arhatship under the
Bodhi-tree, and in so attaining passed from the condition of a
Bodhi-sattva to that of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> of all Arhats—a supreme Buddha.
Then, after about forty-five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of diligent discharge of his
self-imposed task as a teacher of the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of salvation, he
ultimately passed <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in Pari-nirva?a, or absolute non-existence.

It is important, however, to remember, that at the moment of his
attaining Buddhahood he had transferred the Bodhi-sattvaship to
Maitreya, ‘the loving and compassionate one,’ who became the
Buddha-elect, dwelling and presiding as his predecessor had done in the
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of contented beings (Tushita; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 120).

No wonder then that this Maitreya—whose very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> implies <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> and

Gautama, a Saviour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by teaching its inhabitants how to save
themselves—became a favourite object of personal worship after Gautama
Buddha’s death. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> when the worship of other Bodhi-sattvas was
introduced, Maitreya retained the distinction of being the only
Bodhi-sattva worshipped by all Buddhist countries, whether in the South
or in the North. Not that Gautama’s memory was neglected. He was, of
course, held to be superior to Maitreya, who was still a mere
Bodhi-sattva or Buddha-designate. But the feeling towards Gautama
Buddha, after his Nirva?a and death, became different, and the object of
bringing flowers and offerings to his shrines was simply to honour the
memory of a departed, not an existing saint. It was a mere mechanical
act, fraught with beneficial consequences, but not supplying any real
religious need. On the other <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> actual prayers were addressed to
Maitreya, as to a living merciful being, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> favour it was
all-important to secure, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> was believed to be a region of
perfect <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> and contentment, to which all his worshippers were
admitted.

In Hiouen Thsang’s Travels a heavenly ?ishi is represented as
saying:—‘No <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> can describe the personal beauty of Maitreya. He
declares a <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> not <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from ours. His exquisite voice is soft and
pure. Those who hear it can <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> tire; those who listen are <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
satiated[86].’

In fact, the aspirations of few pious Buddhists in early times ever led
them to soar <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the happiness of living with Maitreya and
listening to his voice in his own Tushita heaven.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that afterwards when the worship of the Dhyani-Buddha

But this belongs to a
later phase of Buddhism, to be explained when we speak of the
Dhyani-Buddhas (p. 203).

It was for Maitreya’s Tushita <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> that Hiouen Thsang, and other

inscription <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> at Buddha-Gaya is full of expressions indicative of
the same longing[87].

If then, we are able to enter into the feelings of Buddhists everywhere
in depending on the living, loving, and energizing Maitreya, rather than
on the extinct <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> who existed only in their memories, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> find

here revert to the early constitution of the Buddhist monastic
brotherhood, and endeavour to show how the homage paid to eminent and
saint-like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> led, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to the multiplication of Bodhi-sattvas, and
then to polytheism and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of polytheistic superstition.

A full explanation of the early monastic system is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the learned
<span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Koeppen[88]. It is clear that as <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as Gautama was alive he
was the sole Head of the brotherhood of monks. After his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> the
Headship (as in the Christian brotherhood after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Christ) was
not assigned to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> leader. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself forbade this. The
term Sa?gha at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> merely denoted a republican fraternity of
monks, bound by no irrevocable vows and subject to no hierarchical
Superior, but all intent on following the example, and propagating the
doctrines of their departed leader. Soon, however, the formation of
separate centres of union and teaching became inevitable, and the term
Sa?gha was then applied to each separate society, and sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to
a separate Conclave of each society, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as to the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> body. It
seems at least <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that each monastic association had the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to
admit monks, to hear confession, and to excommunicate. Naturally, too,
in course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it became necessary for each society to have some sort
of governing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and choose a kind of president, and this presiding
officer was originally the senior monk, and accordingly had the simple
title of Sthavira (Thera), ‘Elder.’ This title appears to have been
introduced immediately after Gautama’s death.

It is believed that ever <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> A?oka, Sthaviras or
Elders who became actual superintendents of monasteries, exercised
administrative powers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> those of Abbots; each over his own monastic
community. This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> kind of Headship recognized. It was simply
a superiority of age.

As to any still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of authority corresponding to that of Pope,
Archbishop, or Bishop, and extending over several monasteries, this did
not belong to early Buddhism or to its earliest developments. Lists of
uninterrupted series of pretended Buddhist Hierarchs exist, but are mere
fanciful fabrications. Nevertheless, it is certainly a historical fact
that along with the superiority of mere age, seniority, and experience,
there rapidly grew up _pari passu_ a superiority of knowledge, learning,
and sanctity, which were generally, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> not invariably, combined in
the person of the presiding Elder.

Any one, in fact, who was distinguished for the practice of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span>
degree of meditation, for complete acquaintance with the Law, for
special purity of conduct, and perfect fulfilment of the precepts, was
naturally elevated above the class of ordinary Bhikshus. Such a monk was
from the earliest times dignified by the title Arhat, ‘very reverend,’
i. e. more worthy of honour than the generality. Arhat, in short, was
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> grade of saint-like Bhikshu. Such a
man, too, before long, was raised to a still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> level in the
estimation of his fellow-monks. He was believed to have delivered
himself from all the consequences of acts, whether bad or good—from all
the fetters (see p. 127) of life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> from all re-birth. He
was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> elevated to a still loftier pinnacle. He was believed by his
superstitious admirers to possess unlimited dominion over nature, space,
time, and matter; to be all-seeing, all-powerful, and capable of working
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> kind of miracle. Then, of course, at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> he passed <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in
Pari-nirva?a and was, so to speak, canonized. Be it noted, however, that
such canonization was <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> accorded to an Arhat till after his
departure from the world.

Probably the immediate disciples of Gautama Buddha—that is, his
so-called ‘great pupils’ (see p. 47), were all considered perfect
Arhats. And these perfect Arhats were probably the only saints of the
earliest period of Buddhism. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> there was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who surpassed them all by
an immeasurable interval, and that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. It
was the distinguishing mark of a supreme <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> that he was infinitely
greater than all other Arhats, because he had not only gained perfect
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> himself, but had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> the Saviour of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by
imparting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of how they were to save themselves.

It seems, therefore, only natural that the followers of Buddha, and
probably the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, before his decease, should have <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it
desirable to establish a more systematic gradation of saintship by
filling up the immense gap between ordinary Arhats and the supreme
Buddha. It was this that led to the idea of Pratyeka-Buddhas, that is,
self-dependent solitary Buddhas[89] (see p. 134), as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as to the
notion of a still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Bodhi-sattva, who, as the
Buddha-designate and future successor of Gautama, occupied a still more
exalted intermediate position than a Pratyeka-Buddha.

Of course it became difficult to fix on any living man, or any recently
deceased saint worthy of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> stage of Bodhi, to which a being
about to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a perfect <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was supposed to attain.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to be so elevated (though apparently not by Gautama himself)
was, as frequently mentioned before, the mythical <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> Maitreya.
He was, we repeat, for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the only Bodhi-sattva recognized by
all Buddhists alike, whether adherents of the Hina-yana or Maha-yana.
But he was not a historical personage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Gautama or his immediate
disciples. He was a mere mythological personification of that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
love—of that kindly and friendly disposition towards all living beings
by force of which Buddhism hoped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to conquer the world, and win
it over to itself.

And in conformity with his mythical character, and probably to prevent
the rivalry of pretenders <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> future ambitious heads of monasteries,
he was not to appear for five thousand years, till the teaching of
Gautama had lost its power.

Indeed, it was only to be expected that this rank should at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> have
been accorded to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> person alone—just as in worldly affairs there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

Such was the more simple doctrine of early Buddhism in regard to the
relative position of the members of the Buddhist community.

How then did the teachers of the Maha-yana proceed to amplify this
doctrine?

They taught that there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> methods of salvation or, so to speak,

latter for beings of larger talents and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> powers. The
‘Little Way’ was the simple doctrine, which had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Arhats but only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
Bodhi-sattva; the ‘Great Way,’ on the other hand, was the wider and
broader, which had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Bodhi-sattvas as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Arhats.

satisfied the usual requirements of Saintship received the rank of an

the title Bodhi-sattva.

We have seen (p. 136) that the Hina-yana, or ‘Little system,’ taught
that there were only twenty-four Buddhas who had preceded Gautama. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span>
of these (viz. Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni, and Ka?yapa), with Gautama as
a fourth, had appeared in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age, and only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Bodhi-sattva
(Maitreya) was to come.

But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the ‘Great System,’ it was a mistake to limit the
acquisition of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> Saintship in this manner. It maintained that
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be numberless supreme Buddhas (and, in addition to them,

numberless Bodhi-sattvas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age of the world. In other
words, it propounded the doctrine that the practice of the six (or ten)
transcendent virtues (p. 128), and especially the acquisition of
transcendent wisdom (prajña paramita), <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> qualify <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> saints for the
attainment of Bodhi-sattvaship and Buddhaship. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> theory,
there were to be at least a thousand Bodhi-sattvas, followed by a
thousand Buddhas, while, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to others, Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas
were to be reckoned by myriads.

But this theory of numberless Bodhi-sattvas involved an entirely <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span>
view of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and of the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term.

In fact, the Bodhi-sattvas of the more developed Maha-yana school were
not Bodhi-sattvas at all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the strict <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term. It
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> they resembled the genuine Bodhi-sattva in having gone through a
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> series of existences leading them at last to perfect saintship and
to a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of their own, but they were under no obligation to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up
their Bodhi-sattvaship, quit their celestial abodes, or descend
ultimately as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> Buddhas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth.

Furthermore, they <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> appeared to aim at Pari-nirva?a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> their
earthly counterparts. Their most obvious _raison d’être_ seems to have
been to supply the need of personal objects of worship, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in
Tibet they were believed to have their own secondary corporeal

described as descents (avatara) of portions of their essence in a
constant succession of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> saints,—they <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> really left their own
permanent stations in the heavenly regions. Indeed, it is probable that
the chief <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of their popularity, as personal objects of adoration,
was that they were able to help their worshippers to attain to the same
permanent and unchangeable regions of bliss.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that the ‘Great Vehicle’ took up an attitude which raised it
not only above the simple effort to suppress the passions and desires,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> above the hopeless Nihilism of early Buddhism; for it soon
became the fashion for the most devoted and pious of Buddhist monks to
aspire to the title and actual blessedness of Bodhi-sattvaship rather
than to the doubtful blessedness of utter personal annihilation involved
in Buddhahood. At any rate the numerous Bodhi-sattvas of the ‘Great
Method’ appear to have remained quite contented with their condition, so
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as it involved perpetual residence in the heavens, and quite
willing to <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> off all desire for Buddhahood and Pari-nirva?a.

of Brahmanism on Buddhism. It was at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> a mere plan for creating a

superior to the majority of Bhikshus of the common stamp. Then it soon
developed into a scheme for satisfying the craving of the masses for
divinities of some kind to whom they <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> appeal for help in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of

In all probability the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to receive the title of Bodhi-sattva, next

adherents of Hinduism. And we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add that this tendency is constantly
repeating itself in the religious history of all nations.

There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a tendency to press the saints of other countries into the
service. This is remarkably exemplified in the history of Barlaam and
Josaphat, current in Europe in the Middle Ages. The zealous Roman
Catholics of those <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not exclude so noble a
monk as <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> from the catalogue of their own saints, and so they
registered him in their list as St. Josaphat (Josaphat being a
corruption of Bodhisat). Colonel Yule, in his Marco Polo, states that a
church in Palermo is dedicated to this saint.

And here mention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of a modern deified Hindu teacher or sage,
named Gorakh-nath, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have gone from India into Nepal, and

Very little is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> about him, and he belongs more to Hinduism than to
Buddhism. Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that he was a contemporary of Kabir (1488-1512), and,

<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span> describe him as the third or fourth in a series of ?aiva

<span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> about him is that he succeeded in achieving an extraordinary
degree of popularity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Northern Hindus and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> some adherents of

Western India under the hills.

But the canonization of such historical teachers in India and their
elevation to semi-divine rank did not satisfy the craving of the
uneducated masses, either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Buddhists or Hindus, for personal

existence of the more god-like Bodhi-sattva Maitreya—venerated by both
the Maha-yana and the Hina-yana schools—was not sufficient to satisfy
this craving.

Hence the ‘Great Vehicle’ soon began to teach the existence of numerous
mythological Bodhi-sattvas, other than Maitreya, to whom no historical
character belonged, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> functions were more divine.




                              LECTURE IX.
                 _Theistic and Polytheistic Buddhism._


In the preceding Lecture I have endeavoured to sketch the rise of
theistic and polytheistic Buddhism.

We have now to turn our attention to its development, especially in
regard to the worship of mythical Bodhi-sattvas, and of the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
and other mythological beings.

Some of the Bodhi-sattvas of the Maha-yana or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> System were merely
quasi-deifications of eminent saints and teachers. <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span> were
impersonations of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> qualities or forces; and just as in early
Buddhism we have the simple triad of the Buddha, his Law, and his Order,
so in Northern Buddhism the worship of mythical Bodhi-sattvas—other than
Maitreya—was originally confined to a triad, namely (1) Mañju-?ri, ‘he
of beautiful glory;’ (2) Avalokite?vara, ‘the looking-down lord,’ often
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Padma-pa?i, ‘the lotus-handed;’ (3) Vajra-pa?i or Vajra-dhara,
‘the thunderbolt-handed.’

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mythical Bodhi-sattvas were not <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to early Buddhists,
nor to the Buddhists of Ceylon. They are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in the oldest
books of the Northern School (such as the Lalita-vistara), <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they
occur conspicuously in the Saddharma-pu??arika.

All we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> with certainty is, that when Fa-hien visited Mathura on
the Jumna 400 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after Christ, their cult certainly existed there at
that time.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not be <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> wrong if we assert that it was adopted in about the
third century of our era.

As already indicated (see p. 175), the idea of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Buddhist
triad—the Buddha, the Law, and the Monastic Order—accepted by the
adherents of both Vehicles—was probably derived from the earliest
Brahmanical triad. (See <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> Brahmanism and Hinduism, pp. 9, 44. 74.)

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the second Buddhist triad introduced by the advanced
teachers of the ‘Great Vehicle,’ viz. Mañju-?ri, Avalokite?vara (=
Padma-pa?i), and Vajra-pa?i, corresponded to the later Hindu triad
(tri-murti) of deities, Brahma, Vish?u, and ?iva.

I have explained in ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism’ (pp. 54, 73) how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
Vish?u and ?iva gradually usurped the position of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma, whom
they dispossessed of his co-equality with themselves, and how the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
mythology of the Hindus, which was originally complicated by a large
admixture of pre-Aryan and Vedic elements, ultimately became more
simplified by arranging itself under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> heads of Vaish?avism and
?aivism, all other mythological personages being regarded as forms of
either Vish?u or ?iva.

In contradistinction to this, we find that each member of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
Buddhist triads holds its own, and we are led on to a system which
bewilders us by ever increasing complications—a system which preserves
the individuality of its own triads and deified saints, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
recognizes almost all the gods, demigods, demons, and supernatural
beings of Hinduism.

I propose now to offer some <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the development of the Buddhist
Pantheon, beginning with the mythical conceptions peculiar to Buddhism,
and passing on to those held in common with Hinduism.

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> as to the second Buddhist triad above-named, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be noted,
as a proof of the very gradual growth of Buddhistic mythology, that in
the earlier developments of Buddhism the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Bodhi-sattvas
constituting that triad have very restricted functions.

When I visited the Buddhist caves at Ellora, I noticed that in the
ancient sculptures there, Padma-pa?i and Vajra-pa?i (but not Mañju-?ri)
are represented as attendants of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> Buddha.

Of course it is easy to understand that the duty of guarding the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
ultimately expanded into that of watching over and protecting the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>

to the latter.

In the duty of watching over and protecting the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhist world,
Avalokite?vara (= Padma-pa?i), that is, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> who looks down with

with the reputation for answering prayer which he soon achieved.

In the Lamism of Tibet, he is, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> hereafter, a kind of

Buddhas of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age, but delegating his functions to a succession
of earthly Popes in whom he is perpetually incarnated and re-incarnated,
while at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> preserving his own personality in his own heaven.

Indeed, the popularity of his worship is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the chief
characteristics of the Maha-yana system, and is not confined to Tibet,

who during the continuance of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> presides over
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> cycle of soul-migration. In a word, the temporal welfare of
all living beings, and of all who have to wander through the worlds of
the gods, men, demons, ghosts, animals, and livers in hell, is
especially assigned to him.

People, therefore, pray to him more frequently than to any other
Bodhi-sattva, and not only for release from the misery of future
re-births, but in all cases of <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> bodily danger and domestic
affliction. Hence he has numerous other names or epithets, such as ‘God
of mercy,’ ‘Ocean of pity’ (Karu?ar?ava), ‘Deliverer from fear’
(Abhaya?-da), ‘Lord of the world’ (Loke?-vara), ‘World-protector’
(Loka-pala), ‘Protector of the Aryas’ (Arya-pala); and the Chinese
traveller Fa-hien <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> of himself, that he prayed in his <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> for the
aid of Avalokite?vara when in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> peril during a storm at sea.

That his worship was very prevalent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Buddhists of the Maha-yana

seventh century, is attested <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> by Hiouen Thsang. Both travellers tell
us that they frequently met with his images, which were often placed on
the tops of mountains. Possibly this fact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> he
acquired of the ‘Looking-down lord.’ Or, on the other hand, it is
possible that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have led to the selection of high situations
for his temples and images.

And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be observed here that although Avalokite?vara bears a close
resemblance in character to Vish?u, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> his images often conform to the
Brahma type, and sometimes to that of ?iva[97]. He has generally several
faces—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> eleven or twelve—and usually four or eight arms.
These faces are placed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> above the other in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of a pyramid, in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> tiers, and probably indicate that he looks down on all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
worlds, namely, the worlds of desire, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> form, and of no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> (pp.
213, 214), from all points of the horizon.

Note, however, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of his hands are generally folded, as if adoring
the Buddha, while his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other hands hold such emblems as the lotus and
wheel (especially the lotus). This distinguishes the images of the mere
Bodhi-sattva Avalokite?vara from those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u, who, although
he has four arms, is <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> represented in an attitude of adoration.
Note, too, that the many-headed images of Avalokite?vara probably belong
to the later phase of the Maha-yana, when he was regarded as an
emanation or <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> head
forms the eleventh above his own ten. There are descriptions of earlier
idols, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it probable that Avalokite?vara was originally
represented in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> shape.

When his worship was introduced into China the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> he received was
Kwan-she-yin or Kwan-yin (in Japan Kwan-non)—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> denoting (according
to Professor Legge) ‘one who looks down on the sounds of the world, and
listens to the voices of men.’

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that each of the chief Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> had his female counterpart or
?akti, who is often more worshipped than the male. Similarly the female
counterpart of the male Avalokite?vara is the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> chiefly
worshipped in China and Japan[98]. In those countries he is only <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>
in the feminine character of ‘goddess of mercy,’ and in this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> is
represented with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> arms, but oftener with four or more, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> with
a thousand eyes.

The connexion of Avalokite?vara with ?iva, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as with Vish?u, is
proved by the fact that in some characteristics Kwan-yin corresponds to
the Durga <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva’s wife, and in <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Parvati,
who, as dwelling on mountains, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be supposed to look down with
compassion on the world.

As to Vajra-pa?i (or Vajra-dhara), ‘the thunderbolt-handed,’ this
Bodhi-sattva corresponds in some respects to Indra. He is the fiercest
and most awe-inspiring of all the Bodhi-sattvas, and was, in time,
converted into a kind of Buddhistic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva, resembling that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> in
his character of controller of the demon-host and destroyer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits. Hiouen Thsang describes how eight Vajra-pa?is surrounded the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as an escort, when he journeyed to visit his <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> ?uddhodana.
Vajra-pa?i is of course a popular object of veneration in all Northern
Buddhist countries, where a dread of malignant spirits is so prevalent
that the waving to and fro of an implement symbolizing a thunderbolt
(Vajra, or in Tibetan Dorje) is practised as a method of keeping them at
bay and averting their malice.

Nevertheless, Vajra-pa?i is not so popular as the third Bodhi-sattva,
Mañju-?ri, ‘he of glorious beauty,’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mañju-ghosha, ‘having a
beautiful voice,’ and Vagi?vara, ‘lord of speech.’ This Bodhi-sattva, as
‘wisdom personified,’ and as ‘lord of harmony,’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be regarded as a
counterpart of the Brahmanical Brahma or Vi?va-Karman, the supposed
creator of the universe. Brahma, however, in his character of chief god,
needed no Buddhistic substitute, having been incorporated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> into
Buddhism. Mañju-?ri, as ‘lord of speech,’ seems <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to be a counterpart
of Brahma’s consort Sarasvati.

Mañju-?ri, introduced Buddhism from India into Nepal about 250 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
after the Nirva?a of Buddha, and the mythical Mañju-?ri <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been a
development of the historical personage. His worship is mentioned by
both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang[99], and seems to have been very popular.

A personification of Prajña paramita, ‘transcendent wisdom,’ is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
named. And <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it seems natural that so soon as the Buddhists began
to personify qualities and invest them with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attributes, learning
should have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> selected for deification, as it was by
the Hindus in early times.

Mark, however, that the popular Mañju-?ri has no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> assigned to him
in the Dhyani-Buddha theory.

This mystical theory was a later development. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be explained
thus:—The term Dhyana (Jhana) is a general expression for the four
gradations of mystic meditation which have ethereal spaces or worlds
corresponding to them (p. 209), and a Dhyani-Buddha is a <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> who is
supposed to exist as a kind of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> essence in these <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> regions
of abstract thought.

That is to say, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> who appears on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in a temporary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>

an ideal counterpart, or ethereal representation of himself, in the
formless worlds of meditation (p. 213). These ideal Buddhas are as
numerous as the Buddhas, but as there are only five chief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> Buddhas
in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age—Kraku-cchanda, Kanaka-muni, Ka?yapa, Gautama, and the
future <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> Maitreya—so there are only five corresponding
Dhyani-Buddhas:—Vairocana, Akshobhya, Ratna-sambhava, Amitabha, and
Amogha-siddha (sometimes represented in images as possessing a third
eye). But this is not all; each of these produces by a process of
evolution a kind of emanation from himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Dhyani-Bodhi-sattva,
to act as the practical head and guardian of the Buddhist community
between the interval of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the advent of
his successor. Hence there are five Bodhi-sattvas—Samanta-bhadra,
Vajra-pa?i, Ratna-pa?i, Padma-pa?i (= Avalokite?vara), and
Vi?va-pa?i—corresponding to the five Dhyani-Buddhas and to the five
earthly Buddhas respectively. In Nepal five corresponding female ?aktis
or Tara-devis are named (see p. 216).

It is remarkable that the Chinese pilgrims from the fifth to the seventh
centuries, while often mentioning the Bodhi-sattvas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> no allusion to
any of the Dhyani-Buddhas—whence we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> gather that Amitabha, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span>
adopted into Indian Buddhism, was not actually worshipped in India at
least as a personal god.

In point of fact, it was only the Buddhism of the North which was not
satisfied with the original triad of the Buddha, the Law, and the
Monkhood. It, therefore, invented in addition five triads, each
consisting of a Dhyani-Buddha, a Dhyani-Bodhi-sattva, and an earthly
Buddha, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> of these triads only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was of importance, namely, that
consisting of Amitabha, Avalokite?vara, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> Buddha, Gautama.
But the Lalita-vistara does not mention this theory.

It should be observed, too, that an important addition to the Maha-yana
doctrine was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Northern countries about the tenth century
of our era.

A particular sect of Buddhists in Nepal, calling themselves Ai?varikas,
propounded a theory of a Supreme Being (I?vara), to whom they gave the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of a ‘primordial Buddha’ (Adi-Buddha), and who was declared to be
the source and originator of all things, and the original Evolver of the
Dhyani-Buddhas, or Buddhas of contemplation, while they again were
supposed to evolve their corresponding Dhyani-Bodhi-sattvas.

It is clear, of course, that this addition was a mere adaptation of
Buddhism to Brahmanism, and that the Adi-Buddha was invented to serve as
a counterpart of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Brahma—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> eternally

emanations.

Sometimes, however, this Adi-Buddha is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have produced all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
through union with Prajña (mentioned before, p. 202), in which <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> he
is rather to be identified with the personal Creator Brahma.

Observe, moreover, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in early times <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the

his purely abstract character, and was worshipped by Northern Buddhists
as a personal God. He is in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> held by them to be an
eternal Being, the ideal of all that is beautiful and good, who receives

(see p. 183).

But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be noted that <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> Adi-Buddha nor Amitabha, when
regarded as personal gods, were held to be Creators of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> in the
Christian sense. They were merely Supreme rulers outside and above it;
for Northern Buddhists agree with Southern in thinking that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
exists of itself, and that its only Creator is the force of its own
acts.

We <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on now to consider how <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> and with what modifications the
mythology of Brahmanism and Hinduism was incorporated into Buddhism.

I have already pointed out that although the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> changed the
character of <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the existing mythology, he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> prohibited his
lay-followers from continuing their <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> forms of worship, or bowing down
before the deities honoured by their fathers and grandfathers.

Apart <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> from the shrewd policy of not assuming an attitude of
hostility to popular creeds and usages, the tolerant tendency and
universality of the Buddha’s teaching obliged him, in common
consistency, to recognize, and as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as possible appropriate, the
various religious elements existing around him, and to subordinate them
to his own purposes.

In fact, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the theory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, as has been <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
pointed out by other writers, there was only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> system of doctrine and
only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Law—that <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma) which Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to renovate for
the benefit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> age.

Hence all the apparently conflicting creeds, dogmas, forms, ceremonies,
and usages of all nations, tribes, and races, were in reality mere
outcomes, or dim recollections, or corruptions, of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same
universal Dharma which countless Buddhas had preached to mankind, in
countless ages before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Gautama, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> continue to preach
in ages to come.

Hinduism, therefore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all other creeds, was contained in the Dharma
of Buddhism, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> object of Gautama’s advent was not to uproot
the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> religion, but to purify it from error and restore it.

It was on this <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> that he regarded the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> as occupying a

And here it will be necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the later Buddhist
theory of twenty-six successive tiers of heavens, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> rising above the

In the centre of the world-system stands, as we have seen, the vast mass
of the mythical mountain Meru. On the upper portion of this stupendous
axis of the universe and above the eight chief hells and the worlds of
animals, ghosts, demons, and men, is situated the lowest <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of the

carnal desires.

So far, then, the heavens are all worlds of sense,—like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and
the lower regions,—and are spheres inhabited by beings who have sexual
feelings and live active lives. But at this point in the ascent upwards
all sensuality ceases, and we are introduced to beings who enjoy a
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> condition of existence in which there is no distinction of sex,
and all sensuous desires and objects have lost their hold over the
frame—a condition supposed to be induced by the exercise of mystical
abstract meditation (Dhyana, Pali Jhana).

The importance of Dhyana or intense abstract meditation in the Buddhist
system has been pointed out before (p. 32). It is the chief religious
exercise in which a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> follower of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> can engage, and although it
is divided into four stages, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who exercises himself perfectly in
any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the four, becomes so sublimated and refined that he <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be
re-born in any of the sensuous heavens, or in any region lower than the
Brahma worlds.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage of Dhyana consists in fixing (Dhara?a) the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and at
the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> exercising the thinking faculties on some object, in such
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that a state of ecstatic joy and serenity is attained.

The second consists in concentrating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> so intensely on
itself that the thinking faculties cease to act and only ecstatic joy
and serenity remain.

In the third, <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> remains but perfect serenity.

The fourth is a trance-like condition of utter indifference and torpor,
in which there is <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> any exercise of thought, nor any conscious joy
or serenity, but the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> being is released from the fetters of <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span>
and soars to a transcendental condition, characterized by latent energy
and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working miracles (p. 133).

These four stages of abstract meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be confused with the
four earnest reflections and the five contemplations (pp. 49, 127),
which are not so abstract and require more earthly objects on which to
be exercised.

The fourth and last Dhyana is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Samadhi, and properly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
such a perfect concentration of the soul’s faculties, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
becomes merged in itself. It is often used to denote an ecstatic
condition, scarcely to be distinguished from trance or hypnotism or
catalepsy. Those devotees in India who practise it are buried, not
burnt, and their tombs are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Samadhs.

To return now to Buddhist Cosmology, the theory of later Buddhism is
that he who has practised the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Dhyana will rise at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of

righteousness.

The description, however, belongs to later Buddhism. It enables us to
understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> position of the Buddhist gods. They merely
constitute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the six classes of beings, and, as they have to go
through other forms of life, are inferior to Arhats and Buddhas.

Maha-brahma is often named, whereas Vish?u, the popular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the
Hindus, is neglected. In point of fact he was, as we have seen,
represented by Padma-pa?i (Avalokite?vara, p. 198), who seems to have
taken his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in later Buddhism.

At all events the more modern <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Vish?u <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> K?ish?a, who is
generally worshipped by the lower orders of Hindus as the most popular

When I was at Kandy in Ceylon I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> solitary shrine (Devali)
dedicated, not to K?ish?a, but to Maha-Vish?u. It was near the
well-known Tooth-temple and appeared almost deserted. The shrine was at
the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of a bare room, and contained a small silver-gilt image of
Maha-Vish?u (as Vish?u is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> when worshipped by Buddhists, just as

high. In the hands of the image was a thin metal bar with a kind of
locket or amulet suspended from it, while round its neck was a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
rosary and in front of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> a large plate for offerings. The folding

Buddhism in his character of Yogi, or Maha-yogi (see ‘Brahmanism and
Hinduism,’ p. 83). Then, as the Buddhism of the North very soon became
corrupted with ?aivism and its accompaniments, ?aktism, Tantrism, and
Magic, so in Northern countries various forms of ?iva—such as Maha-Kala,
Bhairava, Bhima—and of his wife (Parvati, Durga, etc.), are honoured,
and their images are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in temples. Sometimes bloody sacrifices are
offered to them.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the female deities forms of Tara are chiefly worshipped, and

Maha-yana—especially in Nepal—that there are five ?aktis or female

Pa??ara, and Tara or Tara-devi (the latter being the Tara _par
excellence_)[101].

But the goddess Tara was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> worshipped by Buddhists in India proper;
for we find that Hiouen Thsang alludes to having seen images of Tara
Bodhi-sattva[102] in the country of Magadha.

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mention, too, that in a dilapidated building, which contains the
Vajrasana or thunderbolt throne of Gautama at Buddha-Gaya (in the same
country of Magadha), I noticed in a shrine near the temple, an image of
Tara-devi, which, from the crown of fresh flowers encircling its head,
appeared to have been recently worshipped by some Buddhist pilgrims, who
had arrived on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of my visit in 1876.

In Ceylon I observed several shrines to Kanda-Kumara, a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Skanda

Buddha.

There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> I observed shrines of Saman (sometimes spelt Samanta,

Then there were shrines dedicated to a demoniacal goddess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pa??ini

No doubt the worship of devils and demons existed in Ceylon <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before
the introduction of either Brahmanism or Buddhism. At Colombo in 1877 I
witnessed a so-called devil-dance, performed late at night before the
then Governor, Sir William Gregory.

First, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> dressed in coarse, loose, jet-black dresses, engaged in
a wild dance together. They had shaggy hair, blackened faces daubed with
white paint, and a <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> of six or eight <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> projecting false teeth,
which protruded <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> below the lower lip, sometimes one, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> at

the glare and smoke from these torches by sprinkling resin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them.

Their dance was of the wildest description, in a circle, sometimes
moving in and out, and crossing each other, and all the while beating
the ground violently with their jingling legs, which kept <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to the
noisy music of tom-toms, flagiolets, horns, etc., played by attendant

of typhus fever. At intervals during their dance they assumed frightful
black masks with hideous open mouths.

Then with them were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other dancing demons dressed in red, not so

demons are the servants of Buddha.

In regard to the other supernatural beings and figments of Hindu
mythology adopted, with a few unimportant modifications, by Buddhists,

The Pretas are beings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of ghosts and goblins who have
recently inhabited the earth, and are often of gigantic size and
terrific appearance, with dried-up limbs, hairy countenances, enormous
bellies, ever consumed with hunger and thirst, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> able to eat
and drink by reason of their contracted throats. Some are represented as
trying to swallow sparks of fire; <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> try to eat up dead bodies, or
their own flesh. Possibly this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of re-birth was invented to deter
the laity from withholding food from the monks. The Pretas inhabit a
region above the hells. Some, however, assign them habitations above the
surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or in desert places on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> itself.

The Asuras or Daityas are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the Titans of Greek
mythology, are always at war with the gods. They dwell under the
foundations of Mount Meru, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> underneath the surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as

In short, if he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be supposed to
live at the zenith, they live at the nadir, and their battle-field is on
the slopes of Meru.

Closely connected with them are the Rakshasas, who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> enemies of

man-eating propensities. They haunt cremation-grounds and cemeteries and
way-lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings in solitary places to devour them.

Then there is a class of very malignant demons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pi?acas (described
in ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 242), who are the authors of all evils.

On the other hand, the Yakshas and Yakshi?is are a class of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii
ruled over by Kuvera, ‘god of wealth,’ who is often referred to in
Buddhist writings under his patronymic Vai?rava?a (Pali Vessava?o)[103].
These beings are commonly represented in sculptures in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> and

cruel. Stories are told about some of them being converted to Buddhism.

Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the Nagas, who are constantly alluded to. They properly belong
to a class of serpent-demons, having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> faces with serpent-like lower
extremities, who live in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the lower regions below the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Patala, or under the waters. They are introduced into Buddhist
sculptures as worshippers of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and friends of all Buddhists,
but usually represented as ordinary men. The Naga Mucalinda (also
Mucilinda), who sheltered Buddha, was a real serpent (see p. 39).
Naga-kanyas or female Nagas (serpents from the waist downwards) are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
not uncommon[104]. In Kashmir Nagas are connected with fountains and the
sources of rivers.

Then there are the Mahoragas, ‘great dragons,’ who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> belong to the
Naga class of demons.

We ought <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to notice the Kumbha??as, a class of demons who attend on
Viru?haka (p. 206); the Garu?as, a bird-like race ruled over by the
mythical Garu?a, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of birds and enemy of the Nagas and serpents; the
Apsarases, or nymphs produced at the churning of the ocean. These last
are sometimes described in Hindu mythology as the Huris of Indra’s
heaven, who are assigned to heroes killed in battle. In Buddhist
sculptures they are represented as beautiful females, who are properly
the wives of Indra’s celestial musicians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gandharvas.

Finally, mention should be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the Kinnaras and Kinnaris—beings who
ought properly to be represented with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> bodies and equine heads, and
are, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the Gandharvas, heavenly musicians. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> recorded in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
legend that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself in a former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was a Kinnari.

All this proves the close connexion of Buddhism with the Hinduism which,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Buddhism, grew out of Brahmanism. In short, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> mythology is so
interpenetrated with the other, that Buddhism in making proselytes
throughout Eastern Asia <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not avoid propagating Hindu mythological
doctrines along with its own.

The consequence was that Hinduism, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> often regarded as an
unproselyting and wholly national religion, really exercised a vast
influence outside its own boundaries and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> alien races.

It is, at any rate, a remarkable fact that no mythological system has
ever spread over so large an area of the earth’s surface as that which,
originating in India, was accepted to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent by all Buddhist
communities. And this Indo-Buddhistic system of mythology, with its, to
us, absurd idolatry, rests on an extremely subtle <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of pantheism,
which is not to be brushed aside as too contemptible for investigation.

It is usual to denounce all such systems as simple Heathenism; but
‘Heathenism’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the religion of ‘the nations’—the religion evolved by
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of all countries out of their own imaginations and by their own
natural faculties, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the aid of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> supernatural revelation.

And assuredly this religion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is still a strong citadel
entrenched behind the formidable forces of pride, passion, prejudice,
and ignorance. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the walls of the fortress have numerous weak places,
which the wise missionary, armed with the still more powerful forces at
his command, will endeavour to discover and quietly undermine. By
patient and quiet working he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> win the day.

With man, speed and rapidity of action are supposed to be the chief
evidences of progress and the chief factors in success. The Evangelist,
on the other hand, is a worker for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and a fellow-worker with God, and
ought not to be discouraged by the tardy advance of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> which he
advocates. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have his moments of despondency, but he has only to

                               LECTURE X.
     _Mystical Buddhism in its connexion with the Yoga philosophy._


The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> idea implied by Buddhism is intellectual enlightenment. But
Buddhism has its own theory of enlightenment—its own idea of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
knowledge, which it calls Bodhi, not Veda. By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> acquired by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> through his own intellectual faculties and
through his own inner consciousness, instincts, and intuitions, unaided
by any external or supernatural revelation of any kind.

But it is important to observe that Buddhism, in the carrying out of its
own theory of entire self-dependence in the search after truth, was
compelled to be somewhat inconsistent with itself. It enjoined
self-conquest, self-restraint, self-concentration, and separation from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and for the
accomplishment of its own _summum bonum_—the bliss of Nirva?a—the bliss
of deliverance from the fires of passion and the flames of
concupiscence. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it encouraged association and combination for mutual
help. It established a universal brotherhood of celibate monks, open to
persons of all castes and ranks, to rich and poor, learned and unlearned
alike—a community of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> which might, in theory, be co-extensive with
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> world—all bound <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> by the common aim of self-conquest,
all animated by the wish to aid each other in the battle with carnal
desires, all penetrated by a desire to follow the example of the Buddha,
and be guided by the doctrine or <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> which he promulgated.

Cœnobitic monasticism in fact, as we have already pointed out, became an
essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism and a necessary instrument for its
propagation.

In all this the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> showed himself to be eminently practical in his
methods and profoundly wise in his generation. Evidently, too, he was
wise in abstaining at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> from all mystical teaching. Originally
Buddhism <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> its face against all solitary asceticism and all secret

In the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (Rhys Davids, II. 32) is recorded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
the Buddha’s remarks shortly before his decease:—

‘What, O Ananda, does the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> desire of me? I have taught the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span>
(desito dhammo) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> making any distinction between esoteric and
exoteric doctrine (anantaram abahiram karitva). In the matter of the
law, the Tathagata (i.e. the Buddha) has <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> had the closed fist of a
teacher (acariya-mu??hi)—of a teacher who withholds some doctrines and
communicates others.’ In short, he was opposed to mysticism.

Nevertheless, admitting, as we must, that early Buddhism had no
mysteries reserved for a privileged circle, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not shut our eyes to
the fact that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance attached to abstract meditation in
the Buddhist system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not fail in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> to encourage the growth of
mystical ideas.

Furthermore, it is undeniable that such ideas were, in some countries,
carried to the most extravagant extremes. Efforts to induce a
trance-like or hypnotic condition, by abstracting the thoughts from all
bodily influences, by recitation of mystical sentences, and by
superstitious devices for the acquisition of supernatural faculties,
were placed above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> and all the duties of the moral code.

We <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> point, too, to the strange doctrine which arose in Nepal and
Tibet—the doctrine of the Dhyani-Buddhas (or ‘Buddhas of
Meditation’)—certain abstract Essences existing in the formless worlds
of thought, who were held to be ethereal and eternal representatives of
the transitory earthly Buddhas. These have been adverted to in a
previous Lecture (see p. 202).

Our <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> concern is rather with the growth and development of
mystical Buddhism in India itself, through its connexion with the system
of philosophy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yoga and Yogacara.

The close relationship of Buddhism to that system is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> known; but the
various practices included under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Yoga did not owe their origin
to Buddhism. They were prevalent in India before Gautama Buddha’s time;
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most generally accepted facts in his biography is that,
after abandoning his home and worldly associations, he resorted to

What then was the object which these ascetics had in view?

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Yoga literally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> ‘union’ (as derived from the Sansk?it root

Doubtless this was the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> aim when he addressed himself to

teaching aimed at restoring the supposed monotheistic doctrine of the
Veda.

It is recorded that his father, desiring to initiate him into the
mysteries of ?aivism, took him to a shrine dedicated to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva;
but the sight of some mice stealing the consecrated offerings, and of
some rats playing on the heads of the idol, led him to disbelieve in
?iva-worship as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of union with the Supreme Being. Longing,
however, for such union and for emancipation from the burden of repeated
births, he resolved to renounce marriage and abandon the world.
Accordingly, at the age of twenty-two, he clandestinely quitted his
home, the darkness of evening covering his flight. Taking a secret path,
he travelled thirty miles during the night. Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he was pursued by
his father, who tried to force him to return, but in vain. After
travelling farther and farther from his native province, he took a vow
to devote himself to the investigation of truth. Then he wandered for

settled at Ahmedabad. There, having mastered the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Yoga system, he
became the leader of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> sect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Arya-Samaj.

And here we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> observe that the expression ‘higher Yoga’ implies that a
lower <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of that system had been introduced. In point of fact, the
Yoga system grew, and became twofold—that is, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> to have

The earlier was the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Yoga. It aimed only at union with the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span>
of the Universe. The more developed system aimed at something more. It
sought to acquire miraculous powers by bringing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> under control
of the will, and by completely abstracting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and mind,
and isolating it in its own essence. This condition is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kaivalya.

In the fifth century B.C., when Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> began his career, the
later and lower <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Yoga seems to have been little known.
Practically, in those days, earnest and devout <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> craved only for union

able to get rid of all bodily fetters—to be able to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> his bodily
organs into such subjection to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> that he became unconscious
of possessing any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> at all. It was in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> became
fit for blending with the Universal Spirit, of which it was originally a
part.

We learn from the Lalita-vistara that various forms of bodily torture,
self-maceration, and austerity were common in Gautama’s time.

Some devotees, we read, seated themselves in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> spot and kept perpetual
silence, with their legs bent under them. Some ate only once a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> or
once on alternate days, or at intervals of four, six, or fourteen days.
Some slept in wet clothes or on ashes, gravel, stones, boards, thorny
grass, or spikes, or with the face downwards. Some <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> naked, making no
distinction between fit or unfit places. Some smeared themselves with
ashes, cinders, dust, or clay. Some inhaled smoke and fire. Some gazed
at the sun, or sat surrounded by five fires, or rested on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> foot, or

themselves in water, or suspended themselves in air.

Then, again, a method of fasting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> very painful (atik?icchra),

that similar practices were resorted to throughout India, with the
object of bringing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> into subjection to the spirit. And these
practices have continued up to the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day.

A Muhammadan traveller, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> narrative is quoted by Mr. Mill (British
India, i. 355), once saw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> standing motionless with his face towards
the sun.

The same traveller, having occasion to revisit the same spot sixteen
<span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> afterwards, <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the very same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the very same attitude. He
had gazed on the sun’s disk till all <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of external vision was
extinguished.

A Yogi was seen not very <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> ago (Mill’s India, i. 353) seated between
four fires on a quadrangular stage. He stood on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> leg gazing at the
sun, while these fires were lighted at the four corners. Then placing
himself upright on his head, with his feet elevated in the air, he
remained for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hours in that position. He then seated himself
cross-legged, and continued bearing the raging heat of the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> above his
head and the fires which surrounded him, till the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the day,
occasionally adding combustibles with his own hands to increase the
flames.

I, myself, in the course of my travels, encountered Yogis who had kept
their arms uplifted for years, or had wandered about from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of

As to fasting, the idea that attenuation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> by abstinence from

countries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be hopelessly outdone by devotees <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> extraordinary

If we now turn to the second method of attaining mystic union with the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Essence, namely, by profound abstract thought, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> observe
that it, too, was everywhere prevalent in Buddha’s time.

Indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the names <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by Indian philosophers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span>
Universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is Cit, ‘Thought.’ By that name, of course, is meant
pure abstract thought, or the faculty of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> separated from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
concrete object. Hence, in its <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> state the eternal infinite
Spirit, by its very nature, thinks of nothing. It is the simple
thought-faculty, wholly unconnected with any object about which it
thinks. In point of fact, the moment it begins to exercise this faculty,
it necessarily abandons for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> its condition of absolute oneness,
abstraction, and isolation, to associate itself with something inferior,
which is not itself.

It follows, therefore, that intense concentration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span>
Universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> amounts to fixing the <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> on a mere abstract
Essence, which reciprocates no <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> in return, and is not conscious
of being <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> about by its worshipper.

In harmony with this theory, we find that the definition of Yoga, in the
second aphorism of the Yoga-sutra, is, ‘the suppression (nirodha) of the
functions or modifications (v?itti) of the thinking principle (citta).’
So that, in reality, the union of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> with the infinite
Principle of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> amounts to such complete mental absorption, that
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> itself becomes lost in pure thought.

In the ?akuntala (VII. 175) there is a description of an ascetic engaged
in this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Yoga, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> condition of fixed meditation and immovable
impassiveness had lasted so <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> that ants had thrown up a mound as high
as his waist, and birds had built their nests in the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> clotted
tresses of his tangled hair.

Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, I, myself, saw at Allahabad near the fort a devotee
who had maintained a sitting, contemplative posture, with his feet
folded under his body, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for twenty years. During the Mutiny
cannon thundered over his head, and bullets hissed around him, but
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> apparently disturbed his attitude of profound meditation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
Muhammadans practise the same. The Russian correspondent of the _Times_
states (Sept. 18, 1888) that he saw in a mosque at Samarkand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who
voluntarily remained mute and motionless for forty days. On a curtain
being pulled aside he beheld a motionless figure seated in profound
meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a squatting mummy. The guide <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that a cannon fired
off in front of his face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have left him equally unmoved.

It is clear, then, that, supposing Gautama to have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> to
devote himself to a religious life, his adoption of a course of profound
meditation was a most usual proceeding.

A large number of the images of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> represent him sitting on a raised
seat or throne (called the Bodhi-ma??a), with his legs folded under his
body, and his eyes half-closed, in a condition of abstraction
(samadhi)—sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yoga-nidra; that is, a trance-like state,
resembling profound sleep. (Compare frontispiece.)

He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have seated himself in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> under four trees in
succession (see p. 39 of these Lectures), namely, under the Bodhi-tree
or sacred fig-tree, under the Banyan-tree, under the Mucalinda-tree
(protected by the serpent), and under the Rajayatana-tree.

And those four successive seats probably symbolized the four recognized
stages of meditation[105] (dhyana) rising <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> above the other, till
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> itself was converted into non-thought (see p. 209).

We know, too, that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> through still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> progressive
stages of meditation at the moment of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> or final decease
(Pari-nirva?a), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described in the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (Davids,
VI. 11):

‘Then the Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> entered into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage of meditation
(pathamajjhanam); and rising out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage, he passed into the
second; and rising out of the second, he passed into the third; and
rising out of the third, he passed into the fourth; and rising out of
the fourth stage, he attained the conception of the infinity of space
(aka?anañcayatanam, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 214); and rising out of the conception of the
infinity of space, he attained the conception of the infinity of
<span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> (viñña?añcayatanam); and rising out of the idea of the
infinity of intelligence, he attained the conception of absolute
nonentity (akiñcaññayatanam); and rising out of the idea of nonentity,
he entered the region where there is <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> consciousness nor
unconsciousness; and rising out of that region, he entered the state in
which all sensation and perception of ideas had wholly ceased.’ (See p.
213 of these Lectures.)

Clearly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> four progressive stages of abstraction did not satisfy the
requirements of later Buddhism in regard to the intense sublimation of
the thinking faculty needed for the complete effacement of all <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
individuality. <span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> altitudes had to be reached, insomuch
that the fourth stage of abstract meditation is sometimes divided and
subdivided into what are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> eight Vimokhas and eight Samapattis—all
of them forms and stages of ecstatic meditation[106].

We read in the Lalita-vistara (chap. i) that at the supreme moment of

If the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was not a materialist, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of believing in the

man, and all liable to change and dissolution.

In brief, the Buddha’s enlightenment consisted, first, in the discovery
of the origin and remedy of suffering, and, next, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of

By degrees, no doubt, powers of this kind were ascribed to them as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>

probably a legendary addition.

It is interesting, however, to trace in portions of the early

In the Aka?kheyya-sutta (said to have been composed in the fourth

that of men, sounds both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> and celestial, whether <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> or near; if he

himself to that quietude which springs from within.’

Then, in the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (I. 33, Rhys Davids) occurs the
following;—

‘At that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the blessed One—as instantaneously as a strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

forth—vanished from this side of the river, and stood on the further
bank with the company of the brethren.’

And, again, the following:—

‘I call to mind, Ananda, how when I used to enter into an assembly of

Then, with
religious discourse, I used to instruct, incite, and quicken them, and
fill them with gladness. But they knew me not when I spoke, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

instructed, incited, quickened, and gladdened them with religious
discourse, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanish away.

Such passages in the early literature afford an interesting
exemplification of the growth of supernatural and mystical ideas, which
led to the ultimate association of the Buddhistic system with ?aivism,
demonology, magic, and various so-called <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> phenomena.

I now proceed to show that the development of these ideas in Buddhism
resulted from its connexion with the later Yoga, which developed similar
ideas.

In the aphorisms of this later Yoga, composed by Patañjali, eight chief
requisites are enumerated (II. 29); namely, 1. abstaining from five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
acts (yama); 2. performing five positive duties (niyama); 3. settling
the limbs in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> postures (asana); 4. regulating and suppressing the
breath (pra?ayama); 5. withdrawing the senses from their objects
(pratyahara); 6. fixing the thinking faculty (dhara?a); 7. internal
self-contemplation (dhyana); 8. trance-like self-concentration
(samadhi).

These eight are indispensable requisites for the gaining of Patañjali’s
_summum bonum_—the complete abstraction or isolation (kaivalya) of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in its own essence—and for the acquirement of
supernatural faculties.

Taking now these eight requisites of Yoga in order, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> observe, with
regard to the first, that the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> acts to be avoided correspond to
the five commandments in Buddhism, viz. ‘kill not,’ ‘steal not,’ ‘commit
no impurity,’ ‘lie not.’ The fifth alone—‘abstain from all worldly
enjoyments’—is different, the Buddhist fifth prohibition being ‘drink no
strong drink’ (p. 126).

With regard to the second requisite, the five positive duties
are—self-purification, both external and internal (both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?auca);
the practice of contentment (sa?tosha); bodily mortification (tapas);
muttering of prayers, or repetition of mystical syllables (svadhyaya, or
japa), and contemplation of the Supreme Being.

The various processes of bodily mortification already described (see p.
228) were repudiated by Buddhism.

As to the muttering of prayers, the repetition of mystic syllables such
as Om (a symbol for the Triad of gods), or of any favourite deity’s
name, is held <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Hindus to be highly efficacious[107]. In a similar
manner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Tibetan Buddhists the six-syllabled sentence: ‘Om ma?i
padme Hum’—‘Om! the jewel in the lotus! Hum!’—is used as a charm against
the sixfold course of transmigration (see pp. 121, 371-373).

Mystical syllables are very common. Sir A. Cunningham gives the
following as current in Ladak:—Bhyo, Rakmo-bhyo! Rakmo-bhyo-bhyo! Ru-lu,
Ru-lu, Hum Bhyo Hum! (Ladak, 386.)

Other mystical syllables (such as Sam, Yam, Ram, Lam, etc.) are supposed
to contain some occult virtue.

The third requisite—posture—would appear to us a somewhat trivial aid to
the union of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the divine; but with Hindus it is an
important auxiliary, fraught with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> benefit to the Yogi.

The alleged reason is that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sitting postures (asana) and cramping
of the lower limbs are peculiarly efficacious in producing bodily
quietude and preventing restlessness. Some of the postures have curious
names, for example:—Padmasana, ‘the lotus posture;’ ‘virasana, ‘the
heroic posture;’ si?hasana, ‘the lion posture’ (see note, p. 336);
kurmasana, ‘tortoise posture;’ kukku-?asana, ‘cock posture;’
dhanur-asana, ‘bow posture;’ mayurasana, ‘peacock posture.’ In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
the legs are folded under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> foot is placed on the
left thigh, and the left on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> thigh.

In short, the idea is that compression of the lower limbs, in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
as to prevent the possibility of the slightest movement, is most
important as a preparation for complete abstraction of soul.

Then, as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> aid, particular mystical twistings (called mudra) of
the upper limbs—of the arms, hands, and fingers—are enjoined.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in Muhammadan countries <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> movements of the limbs are
practised by devotees with the view of uniting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> with the
Divine. Those who have seen the whirling and ‘howling’ dervishes at
Cairo can testify that fainting fits result from their violent
exertions, inspirations, expirations, and utterances of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of God,
and such fits are believed to be ecstatic states of union with the
Deity.

The fourth requisite—regulation and suppression of the breath—is perhaps
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of all the eight which is most difficult for Europeans to
understand or appreciate; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> with Hindus it is all-important. It is
sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ha?ha-vidya. Nor are the ideas connected with it wholly
unknown in Europe.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Swedenborg[108], <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> commences and corresponds with
respiration:—

‘When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> thinks quickly his breath vibrates with rapid alternations;
when the tempest of anger shakes his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> his breath is tumultuous; when
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is deep and tranquil, so is his respiration.’ And he adds: ‘It
is strange that this correspondence between the states of the brain or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and the lungs has not been admitted in science.’

The Hindu belief certainly is that deep inspirations of breath assist in
concentrating and abstracting the thoughts and preventing external
impressions. But, more than this, five sorts of air are supposed to
permeate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and play an important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in its vitality. They
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pra?a, Vyana, Apana, Samana, Udana. In the Chandogya
Upanishad (V. 19, etc.) they are described as if they were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings
to be adored and to be honoured by offerings of food. The Ha?ha-dipika
says: ‘As <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as the air remains in the body, so <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> remains.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> is the exit of the breath. Hence the air should be retained in the
body.’

In regulating the breath, the air <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> be drawn up through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
nostril (the other being closed with the finger), retained in the lungs,
and then expelled through the other nostril. This exercise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be
practised alternately with the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and left nostril. Next, the breath

Thence it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be forced by
an effort of will towards the internal organs of the body, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to
mount to the centre of the brain.

The Hindus, however, do not identify the breath with the soul. They

A well-known instance of suspended animation occurred in the Panjab in
1837. A Hindu Yogi was there, by his own request, buried alive in a
vault for forty <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> in the presence of Runjit Singh and Sir Claude
Wade; his eyes, ears, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> orifice of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> having been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

him followed his previously-given directions for the restoration of
animation, and the Yogi told them he had only been conscious of a kind
of ecstatic bliss in the society of other Yogis and saints, and was
quite ready to be buried over again.

What amount of fraud there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be in these feats it is difficult to say.
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> possibly be accounted for by the fact that Indian Yogis have
studied the habits of hibernating animals; but in some cases the secret
introduction of food has been detected.

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add that it is commonly believed throughout India that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>

<span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of undergoing corruption and dissolution. When his supposed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
occurs he is held to be in a state of trance, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> last for
centuries, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is, therefore, not burnt, but buried—generally
in a sitting posture—and his tomb is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Samadh.

With regard to the fifth requisite—the act of withdrawing the senses
from their object, as, for example, the eye from visible forms—this is
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> compared to the act of a tortoise withdrawing its limbs under its
shell.

The sixth requisite—fixing the principle of thought—comprises the act of
directing the thinking faculty (citta) towards various parts of the
body, for example, towards the heart, or towards the crown of the head,
or concentrating the will-force on the region between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eyebrows,
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> fixing the eyes intently on the tip of the nose. (Compare
Bhagavad-gita VI. 13.)

The seventh and eighth requisites—viz. internal self-contemplation and
intense self-concentration—are held (when conjoined with the sixth) to
be most important as leading to the acquisition of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> supernatural
powers, of which the following are most commonly enumerated:—(1) Animan,
‘the faculty of reducing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the size of an atom;’ (2) Mahiman,
or Gariman, ‘increasing the size or weight at will;’ (3) Laghiman,
‘making the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> at will;’ (4)Prapti, ‘reaching or touching any
object or spot, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> apparently distant;’ (5) Prakamya, ‘unlimited
exercise of will;’ (6) I?itva, ‘gaining absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> over one’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span>
and others;’ (7) Va?ita, ‘bringing the elements into subjection;’ (8)
Kamavasayita, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of suppressing all desires.’

A Yogi who has acquired these powers can rise aloft to the skies, fly
through space, <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> through the key-hole of a door, pierce the mysteries
of planets and stars, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> storms and earthquakes, understand the
language of animals, ascertain what occurs in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the world, or
of the universe, recollect the events of his own previous lives, prolong
his <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> life, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> into the past and future, discern the thoughts of
others, assume any <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> he likes, disappear, reappear, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> enter
into <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it his own.

Such were some of the extravagant ideas which grew with the growth of
the Yoga system, and were incorporated into the later developments of
Buddhism.

We learn from Mr. Sarat Chandra Das that in the monastery of Galdan in
Tibet there is at this moment a college specially devoted to the
teaching of Esoteric and Mystical Buddhism; while magic and sorcery are
taught in the monasteries founded by Padma-sambhava (see pp. 272, 274,
441).

Of course it was only natural that, with the association of Buddhism
with the later Yoga and ?aivism, the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself should have <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a
centre for the growth of supernatural and mystical ideas.

Hence the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is fabled by his followers to have ascended to the
Trayastri??a <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of Indra, walked on water, stepped from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> mountain
to another, and left impressions of his feet on the solid rock. Although
in the Dhamma-pada it is twice declared (254, 255), ‘There is no path
through the air.’

Perhaps the climax was reached when the later doctrine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of the Buddha’s bodies is the Dharma-kaya, ‘body of the Law,’
supposed to be a kind of ethereal essence of a highly sublimated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
and co-extensive with space. This essence was believed to be eternal,
and after the Buddha’s death, was represented by the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> or Doctrine
(Dharma) he taught. The idea seems to have been invented as an analogue
to Brahman, or the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Essence of Brahmanism[109].

The second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the Sambhoga-kaya, ‘body of conscious bliss,’ which
is of a less ethereal and more material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> than the last. Its
Brahmanical analogue appears to be the intermediate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (belonging to

The Brahmanical analogue of this third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> appears to be the earthly

It is evident that the extravagances of mystical Buddhism have their
counterparts in Brahmanism.

There is a Brahmanical legend which relates how the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> sage
?a?karacarya entranced his gross body, and then, having forced out his

deceased king, which he occupied for several weeks.

The Yoga of the Brahmans, in fact, held that adepts, skilled in occult
science, <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> throw their gross bodies into a state of unconsciousness,
and by a determined effort of will project or force out the ethereal
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> through the pores of the skin, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> this phantasmal <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>

And now it is declared to be a fact that a community of Buddhist
‘Brothers’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mahatmas, are living at this moment in the deserts of
Tibet, who, having emancipated their interior selves from physical
bondage by profound abstract meditation, have acquired ‘astral’ bodies
(distinct from their gross bodies), with which they are able to rise in
the air, or move through space, by the mere exercise of will.

Sir Edwin Arnold on the other hand, in his ‘India Revisited’ (p. 273),
states that he asked ?ri Weligama of Ceylon whether there existed
anywhere Mahatmas, who elevated in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> above humanity, possessed
larger powers and more profound insight than any other living
philosophers? Weligama answered, ‘No! such do not exist; you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seek
them vainly in this island, or in Tibet, or in Siam, or in China. It is
true, O my friend, that if we had better interpretations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
Buddha’s teaching, we <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> reach to heights and depths of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and
goodness now quite impossible, but we have fallen from the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> wisdom,
and none of us to-day are so advanced.’

I believe that the Psychical Research Society once sent delegates to
India who inquired into this subject, and exposed the absurdity of some
of the alleged phenomena.

Curiously in agreement with these extravagant notions are the beliefs of
various uncivilized races. Dr. Tylor, in his ‘Primitive Culture’ (i.
440), relates how the North American Indians and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> believe that
their souls quit their bodies during sleep, and go about hunting,
dancing, visiting, etc. It is stated by Mr. Finn, late H. M. Consul for
North Persia, that he <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> induce his Persian servants to awaken
him in the morning. They gave as their reason that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> during sleep
wanders <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from the body, and that a sleeper will die if awakened
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to rejoin the body. The Indian tribes in
Central Brazil have the same belief, so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> Dr. Karl von den Steinen
(recently quoted in the _Times_ newspaper).

Furthermore it is clear that the possibility of acquiring supernatural
faculties is not an idea confined to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> country.

<span class="t20 hoverable">Old</span> legends relate how Simon Magus <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> statues walk; how he flew in the

(Colonel Yule’s Marco Polo, i. 306).

We are told that the phenomena of European spiritualism are to be kept
distinct from those of Asiatic occultism. Modern spiritualism, it is
said, requires the intervention of ‘mediums,’ who <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> control nor
understand the manifestations of which they are the passive instruments;
whereas the phenomena of occultism are the ‘achievements of a conscious
living operator,’ produced on himself by an effort of his own will.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Mr. Sinnett, the important point ‘which occultism brings
out is, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of man, while something enormously subtler and
more ethereal and more lasting than the body, is itself a material body.
The ether that transmits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> is held to be material by any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who
holds it to exist at all; but there is a gulf of difference between it
and the thinnest of gases.’ In <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> he advances an opinion that
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is distinct from the soul. It is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the soul.

And again: ‘The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the prison of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for ordinary mortals.

of his prison, and can emerge from it at pleasure. It is no longer a
prison for him—merely a dwelling. He can project his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> out of his

It is perhaps worth noting that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> believers in Asiatic occultism hold

It is alleged
that this phenomenon has been actually witnessed.

The connexion, however, of similar phenomena with feats of conjuring is
undeniable. In the Asiatic Monthly Journal (March, 1829), an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> is

Nevertheless the subject of mystical Buddhism ought not to be brushed
aside as unworthy of consideration. It furnishes, in my opinion, a
highly interesting topic of inquiry, especially in its bearing on the
‘neo-Buddhism,’ and ‘Theosophy’ of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day. At all events it is
clear from what we have advanced in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Lecture, that the
practices connected with spiritualism, mesmerism, animal magnetism,
telepathy, clairvoyance, thought-reading[115], etc., have their
counterparts in the Yoga system prevalent in India more than 2,000 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>

                              LECTURE XI.
_Hierarchical Buddhism, especially as developed in Tibet and Mongolia._


Early Buddhism was, as we have seen, opposed to all ecclesiastical
organization. It had no hierarchy in the proper <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of that term—no
church, no priests, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of prayer, no religious rites, no
ceremonial observances. It was simply a Brotherhood consisting of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>
who had renounced all family ties, all worldly desires—even all desire
for life—and were pledged to devote themselves to meditation, recitation
of the Law, self-restraint, and the accumulation of merit, not for the
sake of saving others, but for their own deliverance.

It was on this <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> that when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> died he abstained from
appointing a successor, and gave no directions to his followers as to
any particular <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of government. All that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> was, ‘Hold fast to
the Law; look not to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> but yourselves as a refuge.’ In short, the
Society (Sa?gha) he left behind was a simple brotherhood of monks which
claimed some kind of corporate authority for the enforcement of
discipline, but had no Head except the Law. Nor did Buddhism for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> think of contravening the last injunctions of its Founder. Nor has
it ever attempted to establish a universal hierarchy under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Head and
under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> central authority, and although the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa as president

successor of Buddha, and Ananda the second (p. 56), these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
claimed any supremacy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that of Popes. In point of fact Buddhism
simply organized itself in separate monastic institutions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
local ideas and necessities. And <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> the exigencies of healthy
growth, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the simple instinct of self-preservation compelled the
scattered members of the Buddhist Brotherhood to attempt some such
organization very soon after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of their Founder. In ancient
times communication was carried on with difficulty, and the Buddhist
Brotherhood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> only hold <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> by combining for mutual support in
various centres, and adopting some sort of monastic government.

It was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> collection of monks naturally tended to
crystallize into a distinct organized society with <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> definite
rules.

Naturally, the earliest constitution of each was moulded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
the family pattern. The living Head of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> monastery was a kind of
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> father, while its inmates were his children, and these, again,
resolved themselves into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes: the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> consisting of the more
youthful members of the society; the second, of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> more mature
experience entitled them to greater respect and reverence. Then, again,
some kind of pre-eminence was assigned to individuals who were
remarkable for greater knowledge, or sanctity of character.

It is easy to understand, therefore, how it happened that the Sa?gha or
collective community of monks was compelled in the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> to establish
several gradations of rank and position <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> its members.

The following were soon recognized:—1. The ?rama?era or ‘novice’ (who
began by being a Chela or ‘pupil’ under education); 2. The ?rama?a (also
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bhikshu) or full monk; 3. The Sthavira or ‘elder,’ who was merely
superior to <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> in virtue of his age; 4. The Maha-sthavira or ‘great
elder’ (sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sthavira? Sthavira?am); 5. The Upadhyaya and
Acarya. These last were teachers of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> kinds, who received honour
in virtue of their knowledge; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> positions of elder and teacher
being frequently united in the President of particular monasteries.

No doubt gradations of this kind existed in very early times in India,
Ceylon, and Burma. But in India the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Buddhistic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of monks
passed away.

In Ceylon and Burma, on the contrary, Buddhism has held its own. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

any other region of Eastern Asia, although it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span>
that, when it was introduced there, it was grafted on serpent-worship,
Naga-worship[116], demon-worship, and Nath-worship[117], with all of
which, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as with the worship of numerous Hindu gods, it continues
to be adulterated in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day.

The Sinhalese (Koeppen, i. 207, 386) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a list of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> five
successive enforcers of discipline (viz. Upali, Dasaka, Sonaka, Siggava,
and Moggali-putta), and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> list of ten successive Sthaviras or
elders, beginning with Sari-putta. These lists are untrustworthy,
especially as omitting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa.

And I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> here state that the condition of Buddhism in Ceylon is a
subject which I have had an opportunity of investigating personally. I
visited Ceylon in 1877, and had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> interesting conversations with
intelligent monks, heads of monasteries, and a few really learned men,
including a leading monk named Suma?gala, who described himself to me as
‘High Priest of Adam’s Peak[118].’

I found, too, that a lofty idea prevails in Ceylon in regard to the
status of the monkhood. Theoretically, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> monk is regarded as a kind
of inferior Buddha, and revered accordingly. There are boy-pupils,
novices, and full monks, as in Burma (see p. 259). The
admission-ceremonies resemble those before described (p. 77). Admission
confers no priestly powers. Those monks who are Anglicized by contact
with our civilization call themselves ‘priests,’ but they are not real
priests, and have no sacerdotal functions except teaching, intoning the
Law, and preaching. They live as celibates and cœnobites in Pan-salas
(‘houses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of leaves,’ p. 430), or monastic buildings of the simplest
structure.

The number of such monks is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be about 8,000, and their chief

that is, to recite the Tri-pi?aka with its commentary the A??ha-katha in

services in temples. Nor is it the daily practice of monks to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> an example of worshipping and presenting offerings there. So <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
as I was able to observe, the duty of visiting temples belongs rather to
the laity. The monks receive offerings, rather than <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> them. As to
their dress, it resembles that represented in the Buddha’s images, and
ought to consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces of cloth stained yellow or of a dull
yellowish colour. The principal garment is in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> piece, but torn and
sewn <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> again, the object being to reduce its value and assimilate
it to a dress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of rags. The <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the dress is <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> over the
left shoulder, and generally so as to leave the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> shoulder bare. In
some cases both shoulders are covered, or the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> partially so.

A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal of care seems to be taken in Ceylon to instruct the youthful
members of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> in Pali; that is, in the language of their sacred

In the former I noticed
a large central hall, in which the ceremony of admission to the monkhood
takes place.

At Colombo there has been recently a revival of learning, and a modern
Oriental College (called Vidyodaya), for the cultivation of Sansk?it,
Pali, and Sinhalese, has been established under the superintendence of
the learned Suma?gala, ‘the High Priest of Adam’s Peak,’ mentioned
before.

Each monastery in Ceylon has a presiding Head, and generally a temple
and library attached, with considerable property in land, but there is
clearly no organized hierarchy in the proper <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the term, and no
supreme authority <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that of an Archbishop; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the

amounts to thinking about <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> in particular, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> tend, in the

affirmed that the chief religious aim of the Buddhists of Ceylon is to
acquire merit with a view to ‘better’ themselves in future states of
existence, and that their <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> aspiration is to attain to the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span>
of Indra (?akra, p. 207). They have no real desire for Nirva?a (p. 141),
and still less for Pari-nirva?a (p. 142).

Passing on to Burma we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> remark that although in Burma, as in Ceylon,
a pure <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism has prevailed ever <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> its introduction by
Buddha-ghosha (p. 65), and is still existent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> we find that the purer
system is mixed up, as in Ceylon, with the worship of Nagas, demons,
spirit-gods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Naths (commonly spelt Nats, p. 217), and with a kind
of Shamanism derived from the surrounding hill-tribes.

In regard to the gradations of the monkhood a more complete organization
exists in Burma than in Ceylon.

To begin with the boy-pupils:—In Burma nearly all boys <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> inmates of
monastic houses (called Kyoung) with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> object of learning to read
and write. They are simply school-boys and <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> more. Indeed, until
our advent, the monasteries monopolized the education of the country,
and to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent do so still. The real gradations are as follow:—

1. The She? or Shi?, that is ?rama?eras or novices. These are properly
youths of at least fifteen <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age (but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 307); their hair is
cut off and yellow garments are <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> on for a time.

It should be noted that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> male throughout Burma is required to enter
a monastery and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a novice for a portion of his life, if only for a
single Vassa. This is because the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> taught that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhist
ought to conform to his example and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a monk, although he wisely
abstained from imposing any irrevocable vows. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> process is often
merely formal, and sometimes only lasts for seven days.

2. The Pyit-se? or Pyit-si? (sometimes pronounced Patzin) or full monks,
who have the title Pungi or Phungi (sometimes spelt Phungee or Phongie),
‘full of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> glory,’ when they have been at least ten <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> members of
the order. They correspond to the ?rama?as, and are by Europeans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Talapoins (from their carrying fans of palm leaves). Their dress usually
consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> pieces of yellow cotton cloth.

3. The Hsaya (always a Phungi) or Head of a separate monastery, who
corresponds to the Abbot of European countries.

4. The Gai?-ok or provincial Head, who has a kind of episcopal
jurisdiction over all the monasteries of a district.

5. The Thathana-paing (Thathana = Sansk?it ?asana) or supreme rulers,
who correspond to Archbishops. They superintend all religious affairs.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Mr. Scott, there are now eight of them.

Occasionally instances occur of hermit-monks who lead solitary lives,
and sit motionless in meditation for years.

In Siam the gradations of monkhood are nearly similar to those in Burma,
and we learn from Mr. Alabaster that the monastic vow is not binding for
life, but can be cancelled at any time. This rule leads to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Siamese
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> spending at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a monastery.

We have now to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> from Ceylon, Burma, and Siam to Tibet (properly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bod or Bot or Bhot, Sansk?it Bho?a). And here we leave the
simpler forms of Buddhism and are <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> face to face with that highly
developed system which, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> nominally resulting from an expansion of
the Hina-yana, ‘Little Method,’ into the Maha-yana, ‘Great Method’ (p.
158), was really the product of a still further expansion of the ‘Great
Method’ and its combination with other creeds.

In truth, Tibetan Buddhism is so <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other Buddhistic
system that it ought to be treated of separately in a separate volume,
as Koeppen has done. In his elaborate and excellent <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on this subject
he has remarked that for the development of a hierarchy no circumstance
is more favourable than isolation, and that this advantage was offered
in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> degree by Tibet. Up to the moment of its conversion to
Buddhism a profound darkness had rested on it. The inhabitants were
ignorant and uncultivated, and their indigenous religion, sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bon, consisted chiefly of magic based on a kind of Shamanism.

To describe exactly what Shamanism is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no easy task. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be of Tungusic origin[120], and to be used as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for the
earliest religion of Mongolia, Siberia, and other Northern countries.

Perhaps we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not be <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> wrong in asserting that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal
constituents of Shamanism are the worship of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the dread of
spirits.

The inhabitants of Tibet and Mongolia and <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> of other Northern
countries believed that spirits, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and bad, influenced the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
course of nature. They held that such spirits were able either to <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span>
or to avert diseases and disasters, to control the destinies of men, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to decide the fate of the lower animals. Hence it is easy to
understand that the chief function of the Shamans, or wizard-priests,
was to exorcise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons, or to propitiate them by sacrifices and
various magical practices. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they pretended to prevent storms,
pestilences, and other calamities. They were supposed, too, to
understand omens and to predict the future by watching the flights of
birds, by examining the shoulder-blades of sheep, and by similar
devices. Shamanism, in fact, with its Tibetan offshoot, Bon, had <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in
common with the lowest types of ?aivism, ?aktism, and Tantrism, with
which the Buddhism of Northern India, Nepal, and the countries bordering
on Tibet, had already <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> adulterated.

When, therefore, this mixed <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism advanced from those
countries into Tibet, its approach was not resisted as an intrusion. On
the contrary, Tibetan Shamanism, although it had possession of the
field, was quite ready to meet the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> religion halfway. The result was
an alliance, or rather perhaps an amalgamation; and this led to the
establishment of a complex religious system which I have ventured to
call Lamism[121].

Lamism, then, is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism which, although based on the
Hina-yana and Maha-yana of India, is combined with Shamanism,
?iva-worship, and magic, and has a marked individuality and a peculiar
hierarchical organization of its own. This organization has been
compared to that of the Roman Catholic Church. Doubtless in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
receptivity Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have borrowed from Christianity, but Lamism
possesses <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> unique features which distinguish it from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other
system in the world.

Unfortunately few Europeans have, as yet, penetrated into Tibet, and its
sacred literature has been little studied. It follows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> that the
various gradations of the Tibetan hierarchy are not easily described,
and only a general idea of them can be given.

We ought <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> the boy-pupil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Genyen, sometimes spoken of
as Bandi or Bante (= Bandya[122], a term more properly applicable to
monks). Boy-pupils are inmates of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Tibetan monastery; but under
exceptional circumstances a pupil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> live with his parents. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
received after seven <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, and until fifteen, as in Burma (p.
259). He is placed under a full monk, who teaches him and makes him
promise to keep the five chief commandments (p. 126). <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> sometimes

candidate for the monkhood. The real degrees of the Lamistic hierarchy,
as explained by Koeppen and others, are as follow:—

1. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> and lowest in rank comes the novice or junior monk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Gethsul (Getzul), who has been admitted after fifteen <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stage of monkhood by a Khanpo Lama or his representative. His
hair is cut off and he wears the monkish garments, and has 112 rules to
observe. He waits on the full monk, and assists in all functions except
blessing and consecrating. He has been compared to the deacon of the
European ecclesiastical system, but the comparison is misleading, as
shown at p. 76.

2. Secondly and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> in rank we have the full monk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Gelong (or
Gelo?). He corresponds to the Bhikshu, who has received complete
consecration, and is often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by courtesy a Lama (see note, p. 262),
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> he has no real <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to that title. He is not properly a priest,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that in Tibet he often discharges sacerdotal
functions. The ceremony of admission to the full monkhood can only be
performed after the twentieth year, and binds the recipient to 253 rules
of discipline[123].

3. Thirdly we have the _superior Gelong_ or Khanpo (strictly mKhan po),
who has a real <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to the further title Lama, and from his <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and sanctity sometimes becomes a kind of head-teacher
(Sansk?it Upadhyaya or Acarya). As the chief monk in a monastery he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
be compared to the European Abbot; but in respect of consecration he is
only a Gelong. Nor are any of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> grades of monks—so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the
forms of consecration are concerned—higher than Gelongs and Khanpos.

At this point, however, we have to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> the special peculiarity of the
Lamistic system, namely, that some of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Khanpo Lamas are
supposed to be living re-incarnations or re-embodiments of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>
canonized saints and Bodhi-sattvas who differ in rank. These are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Avatara Lamas (see p. 190), and of such there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> degrees, which
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> denote by the letters A. B. C. as follow:—

A. The lowest degree of Avatara Lama. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> an ordinary
Khubilghan (from a Mongolian word—written by Huc, Hubilghan). He
represents the continuous re-embodiment of an ordinary canonized saint
(p. 188), or founder of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery. He is <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> degree
than the Khanpo Abbot, as presiding over a more important monastery.

B. A <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> grade of Avatara Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Khutuktu. He exercises a kind
of episcopal jurisdiction over a still more important monastery than
that presided over by the ordinary incarnated Lama. He represents the
incarnation of a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Bodhi-sattva or deified saint, but he sometimes
claims to be an incarnated Buddha.

C. The <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> Avatara Lama commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Supreme or Grand Lama. He
is not an incarnation of a mere ordinary Bodhi-sattva (p. 188), but a
continuous re-embodiment of either a supreme <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> or of his
Bodhi-sattva. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> notable examples of this <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> degree are the
Dalai and Panchen Lamas, who claim an authority, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that of a Pope or
Archbishop, over extensive regions outside their own monasteries. They
will be more fully described in the sequel (see p. 284).

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be stated generally, therefore, that the Lamistic hierarchy
consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lower and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> grades. We have, besides, to
reckon <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> other distinctions of rank, such as those of the
Rab-jampa, ‘doctor of theology or philosophy,’ the Chorje (strictly
Chos-rje), ‘lord of the faith.’ These are sometimes associated with the
Khanpo or Abbot, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> slightly inferior in rank to that dignitary. It
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the Chorje often acts as a kind of coadjutor Abbot.
Practically they rank below the incarnated or Avatara Lamas. Moreover,
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> monastery there are numerous other subordinate officials; for
example, schoolmasters, teachers who explain the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and guide the
studies of the brotherhood, precentors or choirmasters, secretaries,
collectors of revenue, treasurers, stewards, overseers, physicians,
painters, sculptors, manufacturers of relics, of amulets, of rosaries,
of images, and in some monasteries-especially those of the Red
sect—astrologers, fortune-tellers, magicians (Chos-kyong or Chos-kyo?),
and exorcists. The Lama is not only the priest; he is the educator,
schoolmaster, physician, astrologer, architect, sculptor, painter; he is
‘the head, the heart, the oracle of the laity.’

There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> class of mendicant Lamas, who have vowed to live a
vagabond <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> number of years. They are better <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> than
some others, for they often find their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into British territory.

When I was staying at Darjiling, I encountered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> specimens of the
vagabond class who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from some distant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of Tibet. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
themselves Lamas, though, of course, they had no real <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to that
title. They were clothed in ragged garments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up of thirty-two
patches of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> cloths, and wore thick buskins to protect them from
the snows. Then they carried a kind of knapsack or wallet of goat-skin
behind their backs, and in their hands a sort of sacred drum or tabour
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ?amaru (see p. 384).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to M. Huc, these vagabond Lamas travel for the sake of
travelling. They wander through China, Manchuria, Southern Mongolia,
Kuku Nur, Tibet, Northern India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Turkestan.

There is scarcely a river which they have not crossed; a mountain which
they have not ascended; a Grand Lama before whom they have not
prostrated themselves; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> whom they have not lived, and of
whom they do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> the manners and language.

It should be noted that when an incarnated Lama is the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Head of
a monastery there is generally a temporal Head to manage its affairs.

Then we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not forget that Tibetan Buddhism has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> its organized
female hierarchy, on the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> steps of which are female Khutuktus and
incarnated Abbesses, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as lower gradations of nuns and novices,
living <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in their own convents.

The rules of discipline for the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Lamistic hierarchy fill at least
thirteen out of the 108 volumes of the Tibetan Canon (see p. 272). They
do not differ materially from those of other Buddhist countries. The 253
rules of the Pratimoksha-sutra (see p. 62) are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to contain commands
and prohibitions relating to five sides of the monastic life—conduct,
dress, food, habitation, and occupation.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that early Lamism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism, had
properly no secular priesthood and encouraged no intercourse with the
outer world, except for the reception of alms and food from the laity.
All grades of the hierarchy were supposed to live <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
celibate fraternity in monastic seclusion, apart from mundane
associations. Their only duties were to meditate, recite the Law, and

however, was not <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> borne with equal patience by the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> fraternity.
It soon became irksome to a large section, and the same state of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
which arose in early Buddhism and generally arises in all religious
communities, occurred in Lamism. The fraternity of Lamas became split up
into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief parties or sects—the strict and the lax. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> in
the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> that these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects were distinguished from each other by the
colour of their garments, and especially of their caps, the former
adopting yellow and calling themselves Gelug pa or Galdan pa, the latter
adopting red (Shamar). Of course the lax or Red-cap sect soon infringed
the rule in regard to celibacy, and allowed the marriage of monks under
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> conditions, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> such marriages seem at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to have been
exceptional.

It is said, indeed, that in Nepal, under modern Gorkha rule, the
celibate occupies a lower position than the married monk, to whom the
services in the temples are committed. It is said, too, that the Lamas
of Sikkim and other northern countries constantly have <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> living
with them, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they do not admit them to be their own (p. 152). Yet,
for all that, celibacy is the rule, and nominally, at any rate, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> majority of Lamistic monks in Eastern Asia are unmarried
cœnobites, who live <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in monasteries.

Certainly in no other country in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are monasteries so numerous
or on so vast a scale as in Tibet and Mongolia (see p. 426).

And, indeed, in all probability it was the difficulty of enforcing
discipline and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> in these immense establishments, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some
method of securing obedience to a presiding Head acceptable to all the
inmates, that led to that strange re-incarnation or ‘Avatara’ theory
which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> chief distinguishing feature of Lamism.

The process by which this remarkable theory was developed is so

equal authority with the other. Then in process of time, a rivalry
sprang up between them. Moreover the Brikhung monastery strove with the
Sakya, each trying to acquire predominance. Ultimately they appealed to
the Chinese authorities, who decided that the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> position belonged
to the monastery of Sakya and to the Red sect.

Sovereign of a vast empire, was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to elevate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> above a

of civilizing them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be by adopting and promoting Buddhism, which
the greater number of the races subject to him already professed.

Between the indigenous Shamanism of Northern countries and the doctrines
of Confucius, or of Islam, or of Christianity, there were no points of
contact; whereas Shamanism, as we have seen, had <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> common ground with
Northern Buddhism, which had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> mixed up with ?aivism and magic.

It was this that led Khubilai to adopt the Lamistic or Tibetan <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
Buddhism.

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Lamistic prelates, the Head of the Monastery of Sakya and of

ruler of Tibet. He was <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as the Phaspa (strictly Phags pa),
‘excellent Lama,’ and in return for the supremacy granted to him, was
required to consecrate or crown the emperors of Mongolia.

Koeppen observes that Khubilai was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the creator of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

The Mongolians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> owe their written character and literature to
Buddhism. It was Phaspa Lama who invented the Mongolian alphabet. Taking
the Tibetan alphabet as his model, he invented a square character with a
thousand syllables. He then undertook a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> revision of the Buddhist
sacred writings, causing the Tibetan sacred texts (Kanjur) to be
compared with the Chinese. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that this lasted from the year
1285 to 1306.

Twenty-nine learned men, versed in the Tibetan, Ugrian, Chinese, and
Sansk?it languages, were occupied on the task of collation, and a few
<span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Mongolian translation of the sacred texts was

in Tibet, except that the successive Heads of the Sakya monastery
maintained their position under Khubilai’s successors, and of course
perpetuated and extended the doctrines of the Red school of Buddhism.
Probably they resided at Lhassa, and possibly at the Mongolo-Chinese
Court.

In 1368, the last Mongol emperor was expelled by the founder of the Ming
dynasty, after Jenghiz’s family had occupied the throne of China for
about a century.

The emperors of this dynasty did their best to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> Tibet under the
Chinese Government, and to conciliate the Tibetan Lamas by gifts,
titles, and other favours. But they <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it politic to prevent the
predominance of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> monastery.

Tsong Khapa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> is as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> celebrated in Mongolia and Tibet and

where the celebrated monastery of Kunbum or Kumbum—situated North of
Tibet on the borders of China—now stands. All sorts of legends, but none
worth repeating, are related about him. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> note, however, a probable
tradition that a learned Lama, ‘with a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> nose and bright eyes,’ who
had settled in the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Amdo, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> possibly have been a Roman
Catholic priest, became his teacher.

In process of time, Tsong Khapa <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out on a journey from Amdo to Tibet,
his object being to acquire a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the doctrine from original
sources. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have studied the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at Sakya,
Brikhung, and Lhassa. It was in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that he became impressed with
the necessity of purifying and reforming the discipline of Tibetan
Buddhism, which the Red sect had corrupted by allowing the marriage of
monks and by laxity in other matters. Innumerable pupils gathered round
him, all of whom adopted, as their distinguishing mark, the orthodox
yellow garments of primitive Buddhism, and especially the yellow cap (p.
268); while the followers of Padma-sambhava and the more corrupt school
wore red garments and a red cap.

Tsong Khapa soon acquired vast influence, and in the year 1409 was able
to build on a hill about thirty miles from Lhassa, the afterwards
celebrated monastery <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Galdan (or Gahdan) of the Yellow school. Of
this Tsong Khapa was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Abbot. His followers, however, rapidly
became too numerous to be comprehended <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> so limited an area. Hence
there arose in the immediate neighbourhood of Lhassa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
monasteries, Brepung (also written Dapung, etc., <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 442), founded by
Jam-yang Chos-rje, and Sera ‘the Golden,’ founded by Byam Chen Chos-rje.

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> monasteries once held 30,000 monks of the Yellow sect, but
now have only 16,500.

Tsong Khapa wrote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> works, which enjoy a quasi-canonical authority

Undeniably, Tsong Khapa’s chief merit was that he caused his followers
to revert to the purer monastic discipline, especially to the rule of
celibacy. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> purified the forms of worship, and greatly restricted
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> altogether prohibiting the use of magical rites. Tsong Khapa,
too, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have re-established the original practice of retirement
for religious meditation at <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> seasons, although as there was no
rainy season in Tibet, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> period had to be chosen.

Travellers in Tibet have often described the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> points of resemblance
between the Roman Catholic and Lamistic systems, such as the Popedom,
the celibacy of the priesthood, the worship of saints, confession,
fasting, processions, <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> water, bells, rosaries, mitres, croziers,
etc. These resemblances and coincidences will be more fully noted in a
subsequent Lecture (see pp. 338, 339).

It is possible that Tsong Khapa <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have imbibed some of his notions
from his instructor at Amdo already named (p. 277), who was either a
Roman Catholic missionary, or was familiar with the constitution of the
Romish hierarchy. On the other hand, it is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that celibacy,
confession, and fasting existed in Buddhism before the teaching of
Christ, and <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before that of Tsong Khapa.

In fact, Tsong Khapa’s reformation had been to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> extent
anticipated, as we have seen, by the school of Kadampa, founded in the
eleventh century, by Atisha’s disciple, Brom Ton (p. 273).

Very little more is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> about Tsong Khapa. He died in the year 1419,
or, as his disciples believe, ascended to heaven, and that ascension is
still celebrated during the festival of Lamps by all orthodox Buddhists
of the Lamistic Church (see pp. 345, 346).

When some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> after his death, he was canonized, he was regarded by
some as an incarnation of Amitabha, or by <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> of Mañju-?ri, or by
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> of Vajra-pa?i (see p. 195), or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of the Maha-kala <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
?iva, and his image is generally <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in the temples of the Yellow
sect, and often between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> images of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen
Lama, on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and left respectively.

His followers of the Yellow school <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> themselves Gelugpa (or
Gelukpa), ‘adherents of virtue’ (or, Gal-danpa from their monastery);
their principal characteristic being that they adhered to the purer
discipline.

The chief point of interest in connexion with Tsong Khapa is the bearing
of his reformation on the development of the Avatara theory already
mentioned (see pp. 190, 265).

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that Tsong Khapa himself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Gautama Buddha, had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief
pupils, and that he appointed these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to succeed him with equal
authority as Heads of the orthodox sect. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> credited with having
been the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to promulgate the doctrine that no election of successors
to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pupils <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> at any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> be needed, as each of them on dying
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be constantly re-born in a supernatural manner.

There is, however, no historical foundation for such a statement.
Indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the opinion of some, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Grand Lamas were
merely the lineal successors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> eminent Lamas, Atisha and his
pupil Brom Ton (see p. 273).

After all, it seems most likely that the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Avatara theory was an
invention of some shrewd Head Lama, who, perceiving that the strict
enforcement of celibacy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> prevent any hereditary succession, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
that possible in monasteries of the Red school, and foreseeing that it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be necessary to prevent the suicidal divisions to which the
intrigues of an election to the Headship of monasteries—especially of
Grand Lama monasteries—would be likely to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> rise, bethought himself
of a compromise between hereditary succession and election. After more
than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> trial, the system was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> to <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> that it was
eventually adopted with little modification by all Northern Buddhists,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> by those of the Red sect.

The date of its invention is as uncertain as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the inventor.
All that can be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> is, that it <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be traced back to an earlier
period than the fifteenth century.

And here we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> again guard against the confusion of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> likely to
arise from the usual practice of translating Avatara by ‘incarnation.’

We have seen that the doctrine of transmigration (gati) through various
embodiments, as applicable to all beings, is a fundamental dogma both of
Brahmanism and of Buddhism, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in Buddhism transmigration properly
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> a mere continuous transformation and reconstruction of the
elements (Skandhas) of being (p. 109).

The idea is very dimly, if at all, adumbrated in the Mantra portion of
the Veda.

It is more clearly traceable in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the Brahma?as, and distinctly
enunciated in the Chandogya Upanishad (V. x. 7) thus:—‘He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> conduct
has been good, quickly attains to some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> embodiment as a Brahman,
Kshatriya, or Vai?ya. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> conduct has been bad, assumes an inferior
embodiment, as a dog, a hog, or a Ca??ala.’ In Manu the theory is fully
developed.

Now it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that in Buddhism this kind of transmigration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
described as a continuous series of incarnations, although genuine
Buddhism denies the separate existence of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> between each
incarnation (see p. 110).

But the doctrine of repeated incarnations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> in six forms
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is quite distinct from the Tibetan Avatara theory. This theory
not only recognizes the separate existence of an immaterial essence or
soul, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> teaches that the Head Lama of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> monasteries is the
living, visible embodiment, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, of the continuous
descent (avatara) on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> of a portion of the essence of the canonized
Founder of a monastery or of a celestial Bodhi-sattva or Buddha, who
will perpetually continue to descend from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and re-appear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>
forms for the welfare of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (see p. 109)[129].

A similar idea, we know, prevails in India, where the doctrine of the
descent (avatara) of portions of the essence of Vish?u and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> is
common. There is, however, a noteworthy distinction in the Hindu
doctrine, because the descents of Vish?u are not continuous and
uninterrupted (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ pp. 47, 107-116); and
although <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hindu teacher is supposed to be the embodiment of a
portion of the essence of a deity, each such embodiment is isolated and
single.

And here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> theory is that the continuous descents of
Bodhi-sattvas and Buddhas into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> forms were effected by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of

Bodhi-sattvas as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as to Buddhas; or, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> theory,
through rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> proceeding from the essences of the Bodhi-sattvas,
just as the Bodhi-sattvas themselves were held by some to have been
generated by rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> proceeding from the Dhyani-Buddhas.

Or again, the Dhyani-Buddhas <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> incarnate themselves not only
intermediately through their Dhyani-Bodhi-sattvas, but by the
transmission of rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> directly from their own essences into a
continuous succession of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings of pre-eminent sanctity.

Hence it is clear that the Avatara Lama is no example of the working of
either Hindu metempsychosis or of Buddhist metamorphosis. And indeed,
re-birth, through transmigration and transformation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the
ordinary Hindu and Buddhist theories, is regarded as a kind of natural
act, whereas continuous incarnation through the descent of a portion of
a celestial essence into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> bodies is a supernatural act.

Of course, as we have stated, there were lower and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Avataras,
corresponding to the difference in rank of Saints and Bodhi-sattvas (see
pp. 190, 265).

Examples of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> Avataras are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> quasi-Popes, or <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
Kings, who are supreme Lamas of the Yellow sect—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> residing at
Lhassa, and the other at Tashi Lunpo (Krashi Lunpo), about 100 miles
distant, in a south-westerly direction, not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the town of
Shigatse (or Shigatze, capital of the province of Tsang), and not very
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from our Indian frontier.

The Grand Lama at Lhassa is the Dalai Lama, that is, ‘the Ocean-Lama, or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and learning are as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> as the ocean;’ a half
Mongolian half Tibetan title—Dalai (or Tale) <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> in Mongolian
‘Ocean,’ and Lama <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> in Tibetan ‘a superior Teacher’ (see note, p.
262). He has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the Tibetan title of rGyamthso Rinpoche (Rin-po-ce),
‘Ocean-Jewel’ (the Tibetan equivalent for Dalai being rGyamthso).

The other Grand Lama who resides in the monastery of Tashi Lunpo, is
<span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> in Europe under the names of the Tashi Lama (sometimes written
Teshu Lama) or Panchen Lama (called in Mongolian Bogdo Lama). He has the
Tibetan title of Panchen Rinpoche (Pañ-cen Rin-po-ce), ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Pa??it
Jewel’ (Pan being equivalent to Pa??ita, and chen <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> great).

Hence Tashi Lunpo is the second metropolis of Lamism (see p. 443). It is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been built by Gedun grub pa, the chief pupil of the
Reformer Tsong Khapa, in 1445 (see p. 291).

<span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">Neither</span> of these Grand Lamas are Popes in the European sense, for
<span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> are elected by a conclave of chief Lamas.

The belief is that when they quit their bodies at death, they re-appear
after nine months, or occasionally after the second or third year, in
<span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> bodies they have occupied from conception.

The Dalai Lamas are held to be continuous re-incarnations of the
Dhyani-Bodhisattva Avalokite?vara (p. 197), while the Panchen Lamas are
continuous re-incarnations of his <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha (p.
203).

Hence, as the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is superior to the son, and the master to the
pupil, the Panchen Lama at Tashi Lunpo <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> reasonably have ranked
above the Dalai Lama at Lhassa. But, as Avalokite?vara is the special
patron of the Lamistic Church in Tibet, his incarnation at Lhassa is
practically a more important personage than the incarnated Dhyani-Buddha
at Tashi Lunpo. Some hold that the Panchen Lama is only a re-incarnation
of Tsong Khapa, who was identified with Mañju-?ri.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the Dalai Lama exercises secular authority over about
four millions of people, including monks; although in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
political <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> has to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent been taken from him by the Chinese
Government, which has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> permanent Commissioners or Residents (called
Ampas) at Lhassa, and sometimes sends a special Envoy (Kin-Tche)[130].

The real fact is, that <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> mere children, who are too young to have
received any education, are elevated to the Grand Lamaship, and most of
them either die naturally or are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to die before they have gained any
knowledge, the re-incarnated Lamas are generally unfit to govern, and in
monasteries which have an Avatara Grand Lama, an elected chief Lama acts
as regent or administrator of affairs, while the incarnated <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
supposed to lose himself in sublime heights of meditation and receive
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> homage[131]. This elected Regent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> governs during the
intervals of the incarnations, and at Lhassa he is the real Head and
most powerful Tibetan official. He is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nomun-khan or Nomin-khan
(or No min han).

The manner in which the Avatara doctrine is carried into practice has
varied at <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> times.

It is alleged that formerly the departing Lama, before he transferred
himself to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> body, was in the habit of revealing where and in what
family he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be re-incarnated. Or occasionally it happened that
<span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out suddenly, as if
impelled by some <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> influence, ‘I am a living Buddha, I am the
chief Lama of such and such a monastery.’

Or more commonly the sacred books were consulted; or the official
soothsayers gave their opinion.

But the usual rule was that at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the Dalai Lama the
interpretation of the traditions and oracles about his re-birth and the
duty of discovering the family in which he was to appear were committed
to the Panchen Lama. When the Panchen Lama himself died, the Dalai Grand
Lama did the same service for him.

It was only natural that the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Tibet, and especially the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
<span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa, should have been most fruitful in re-incarnations, and
should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> have supplied foreign countries with them.

When Messrs. Huc and Gabet were travelling in Mongolia they were about
to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Lamistic convent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> stopping, when a Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>
out and invited them to enter, that they <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have an opportunity of
paying adoration to the saint enthroned within. ‘Our saint,’ he said,
‘is not a mere man. In our small convent we have the happiness to
possess a living Buddha! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago he deigned to descend from the

Buddhas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to M. Huc, are very numerous. Sometimes a clever Lama
builds a small temple and attracts a few disciples. Then by degrees his
reputation increases. Other Lamas build their cells near the temple, and
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> it into fashion, and proclaim him to be a living Buddha.

It is said, indeed, that some <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> Heads of the Hierarchy in Lhassa
have contrived to instal their illegitimate <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> in the Headship of

these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> on lots, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them in a golden urn.

in retirement. During all that period they are supposed to fast and to
be engaged in repeating prayers. On the seventh day, the leading
Khutuktu draws a lot, and the infant or child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> comes out is

In a similar manner, the Panchen Lamas, Khutuktus, and ordinary Avatara
Lamas are elected.

The Mongolian mode of election is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> described by M. Huc. (The
quotation is not literal, and is abridged.)

  The election and enthronization of the living Buddhas is extremely
  curious. When a Grand Lama is ‘gone away,’ that is to say, is dead,
  the event is by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a matter of mourning in the convent.
  There are no tears or regrets, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> knows that the living
  <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> will soon re-appear. The apparent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> is only the
  commencement of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> existence, a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> link added to a boundless and
  uninterrupted chain of successive lives—a simple palingenesia. While
  the saint is in the chrysalis state, his disciples are in the greatest
  anxiety, and the grand point is to discover the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where their
  master has returned to life. If a rainbow appears, they consider it as
  a sign sent to them from their Grand Lama, to assist them in their
  researches.

  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> then goes to prayers, and especially the convent which has
  been widowed of its <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is incessant in its fastings and orisons,
  and a troop of chosen Lamas <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out to consult the Churchun or diviner
  of hidden things. They relate to him the time, place, and
  circumstances under which the rainbow has appeared: and he then, after
  reciting some prayers, opens his books of divination, and at length
  pronounces his oracle; while the Tartars who have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to consult him,
  listen on their knees with the most profound devotion.

  ‘Your Grand Lama,’ they say, ‘has returned to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in Tibet—at such a
  place—in such a family;’ and when the poor Mongols have heard the
  oracle, they return full of joy to their convent, to announce the
  happy news. Sometimes the living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> announces himself, at an age
  when other infants <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> articulate a word; but whether his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
  abode be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of the rainbow, or by this spontaneous
  revelation, it is always at a considerable distance, and in a country
  difficult of access. A grand procession is then made, headed by the
  king, or the greatest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> in the country, to fetch the young living
  Buddha. The Mongols often go through incredible fatigue and hardships,
  traverse frightful deserts, and sometimes, after being plundered by
  robbers, stripped of everything, and compelled to return, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out
  again with undiminished courage. When the living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is found,
  however, he is not saluted Grand Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a previous examination.
  Doubtless, the simple Mongols are in this matter often the dupes of
  those who have an interest in making a Grand Lama of the baby. The
  title of the living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> having been confirmed, he is conducted in
  triumph to the monastery of which he is to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> Grand Lama; and as
  he passes along, the Tartars <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> troops and prostrate
  themselves before him, and <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> him offerings. As soon as he arrives
  at the convent, he is placed on the altar, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Tartar, from the
  <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> to the lowest in the land, bows down before this child. There
  is no Tartar kingdom which does not possess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these living
  Buddhas; but there is always <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> Grand Lama, chosen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the
  members of the royal family, with whom the real government of the
  convent rests. The famous maxim ‘Le roi règne et ne gouverne pas’ has
  been of <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> application <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the Tartars. [See <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> p. 306 of these
  Lectures.]

It should be noted that the Lamistic community <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> to keep up the
fiction of these re-incarnations; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they pretend to
ascertain the genuineness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> re-birth by clear signs. Hence before
a re-born saint is installed, his identity is established by his passing
a kind of examination before a solemn assembly, thousands of witnesses
being present.

Some of the books, clothes, and sacred or secular utensils which the
dead Lama was in the habit of using, are <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and mixed with others.
The child is then asked to pick out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> ones, or he has to answer
questions as to the events in his previous state of existence. If the
replies are satisfactory, he is installed as the re-born Lama amid <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
rejoicings.

Koeppen asserts that no positive information as to the relationship
between the Dalai and Panchen Lamas is forthcoming. Some maintain that
both hierarchical systems developed simultaneously. Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the
Panchen Lama of Tashi Lunpo was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Grand Avatara Lama, while
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> hold that the elevation of the Panchen Lamas took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> later,
and only resulted from the increase in importance of the Tashi Lunpo
monastery in which they reside (p. 284).

The Dalai Lamas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be enumerated as follow:—

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been Gedun grub pa (otherwise pronounced Gedun
dubpa). Probably he was the nephew and chief pupil of the Reformer Tsong
Khapa. It was he who founded the monastery of Tashi Lunpo in 1445, and
he is by some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Lama of that monastery. His
birth is supposed to have occurred in 1391 or 1419, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> in
1473 or 1476. Then he was born again after ten months as Gedun GyamThso
(or Gedun Yamtso), the second Grand Lama, who is held by some to have
been the real founder of the Avatara system of perpetual succession by
reincarnations. He filled the Dalai Lama Chair from 1474 or 1476 to 1540
or 1542.

The third embodiment took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in 1543, and bore the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Sod nam

A similar list of the Panchen Lamas who have reigned at Tashi Lunpo has

pilgrimages there. Sarat Chandra Das states that it is inhabited by
9,000 Lamas of the Yellow sect. Koeppen <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that it has a University
with four Faculties, and an important printing-press, and that at the
head of it is an incarnated living Buddha. The Lamas from Amdo are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
by Koeppen to be more highly-gifted, intelligent, learned, and religious
than the monks of other monasteries. They are intrusted in Lhassa with
the most important offices, and are employed in the education of the
infant representatives of Buddha. Amdo is still almost a terra
incognita.

Passing on to Nepal—this country probably adopted Buddhism before the
beginning of the Christian era. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that A?oka’s missionaries

flourished in Nepal till the seventh century, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> then it <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
existed except in conjunction with Brahmanism. It is probable that
Buddhist monasteries and Brahmanical temples always adjoined each other.
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the immigration of the Hindus into Nepal, and especially
<span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the invasion of the Gorkhas, there have always been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

with each other.

In recent times Brahmanism has gained the predominance as the
State-religion, and Buddhism has degenerated, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it is everywhere
tolerated.

It is a question whether the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> supremacy of the Tibetan Grand
Lama has ever been acknowledged in Nepal proper. But, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to some,
the Dalai Lama formerly had a legate or representative in the largest
and oldest Buddhistic temple of Khatmandu—the temple of Svayambhu-nath,
who is here at once Adi-Buddha and ?iva. The Dalai Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> claimed the
ownership of this temple, which, he maintained, had been dependent on
him from the earliest times. But it is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> if the Tibetan
Legate ever possessed the authority arrogated by him, he was compelled
by the Gorkhas to abandon his claims. Nevertheless the Tibetan tribes
now in Nepal still adhere to Buddhism. The same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of the
Newars, who are the original possessors of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> valley of Nepal.
They profess a kind of Buddhism, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they reject the Lamas, and have
priests of their own, whom they call Bandya (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> p. 263).

With regard to Bhutan (capital town Punakha) it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
Buddhist about 350 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. Its <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> ruler and incarnated saint
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharma-raja (or Lama Rinpoche). He belongs to the Red-cap
school, and calls himself Chief of all the monks of the Dugpa sect. His
subordination to the Dalai Lama is little more than nominal. The
temporal Governor is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Depa-raja (Deb-raja).

The following titles engraved on the Dharma-raja’s seal of office will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> some idea of his pretensions:—

‘I am the Chief of the realm. Defender of the Faith. Equal to Sarasvati
in learning. Chief of all the Buddhas. Head-expounder of the ?astras.
Caster out of devils. Most learned in the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Laws. An Avatar of God.
Absolver of sins. Head of the best of all religions.’ (See Dr. Wright’s
Nepal.)

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that there are about 10,000 monks, and about 50,000 Buddhist
lay families in Bhutan. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of the monks do not live in monasteries,
but hold offices under the Government.

Next, as to Sikkim—of which Darjiling, now the Sanitarium of the Bengal
Government, once formed a part. This is a small boundary country between
Bhutan and Nepal. It seems to have adopted Buddhism about the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
as Bhutan, or perhaps a century earlier. The Lamas there belong to the
Dugpa Red sect (p. 268). The aborigines, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lepchas, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> they
venerate the Lamas, are really only half Buddhists; and their priests,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bijna (Bhikshu?) beggars, are half devil-exorcists. The oldest
temple is that of Pemyangchi (see p. 432). Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the important
monasteries of Tassiding, Changachelling, Raklang, and Tamlung (one
residence of the Raja, the other being at Chumbi in Tibetan territory).
There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> near Darjiling.

We ought finally to advert briefly to China and Japan. It is noteworthy
that next in rank to the Mongolian Grand Lama comes the Head Lama of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery of Peking, who represents Lamism in that country.
Koeppen informs us that in China, for at least six centuries, there have
been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes of Buddhist monks side by side, viz. first, the
Ho-shang (p. 92) or Chinese monks, who had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> naturalized in the
year 65 after Christ; and, secondly, the Lamas. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> schools are
not distinguished so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> by difference of doctrine and discipline, as
by the position they hold in the empire. The Ho-shang are little more
than separate fraternities of monks, tolerated by the State. They have
no hierarchical organization, and no bishops, but each monastery stands
independently, and has no superior except its own Abbot.

On the other hand, the Lamas constitute in China a public organized
society, acknowledged to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent and supported by the State, and
possessing <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> and temporal rights over particular
districts. It is said, however, that the Lamistic hierarchy in China is
subordinated to the Government Committee for foreign affairs.

It is further stated that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monasteries situated in or near
Peking are exclusively reserved for the Tibetan and Mongolian Lamas, and
that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Lamas who preside over these the chief is the
before-mentioned representative of Lamism at the Government Court (p.
295).

In China proper, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the eighteen Provinces, the number of the Lama
monasteries is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be small, and these are generally to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in
the Provinces nearest to Tibet and Mongolia.

As to Japan, it does not appear that the Lamistic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism has
penetrated into that country. In all probability Buddhist writings were
introduced there from Corea about A.D. 552[134], but it is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that
Buddhism did not gain <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> ascendency in Japan till the ninth century,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> then was not able to displace either Shintoism or Confucianism
and the worship of deceased ancestors. In fact, Buddhism commended
itself to the Japanese, as it did to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> country to
which it spread by its receptivity; and just as in Tibet, it adapted
itself to the Shamanism which previously existed there, so in Japan it
adopted Shintoism, and turned some of the Shinto deities into
Bodhi-sattvas. Then followed the inevitable splitting up of Japanese
Buddhism, as of all other religious systems, through disagreements and
divisions; and in the thirteenth century various sects were developed.
As to these, we need only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> that while some sects adopt the early
Atheistic and Agnostic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Buddhism with its doctrine of Nirva?a,
the principal sect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Shin is decidedly Theistic.

Sir Edward Reed, in his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on Japan (i. 84), informs us that he met a
learned priest named Akamatz in company with the Archbishop of the
Western sect. This priest’s <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the Shin sect coincides with the
information which I myself received from a learned Japanese priest at
Oxford.

It appears that the members of this sect believe in Amitabha <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as a
Being of infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> and goodness, their chief prayer-formula being
Namo Amida (for Amita) Butsu, ‘Reverence to the Infinite Buddha,’ that
is to Amitabha[135]. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> faith in the <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> and mercy of Amita
Buddha, or rather in his readiness to receive them into his paradise
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sukhavati (see pp. 183, 204). At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they are required
to lead moral lives, and salvation is practically only obtainable
through their own works. The monks are allowed to marry and to eat flesh
and fish.

Their doctrines have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> points of contact with Christianity. The late
Mr. Kasawara of Japan, who belonged to this sect and was highly esteemed
by all who knew him in England, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to a Christian friend that ‘it gave

aspirations of his own Buddhist faith, and that he greatly admired the
idea of the <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> as the concrete expression of the Inscrutable Essence

the following effect:—‘Glory be to the salvation-bringing <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> of the
Law!’

country to which Lamistic Buddhism has hitherto penetrated. There are
adherents of the Dalai Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the Burat (Buryad) tribes on the

Hierarchical Buddhism naturally leads us on to the subject of ceremonial
Buddhism, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be reserved for the next Lecture.




                              LECTURE XII.
                 _Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism._


Having in the last Lecture described the manner in which hierarchical
systems were established in various Buddhist countries, we are naturally
led on to consider in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Lecture the development of what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Ceremonial and Ritualistic Buddhism’; for no hierarchy can
maintain its hold over the masses anywhere <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the aid of outward
manifestations, rites, ceremonies, and appeals to the senses.

Early Buddhism was, as we have already shown, vehemently opposed, not
only to all sacerdotalism, but to all merely external ritualistic and
ceremonial observances. It swept <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> Vedic ritual—the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
sacrificial system of the Brahmans; it rejected all penitential
austerities and painful bodily mortifications; it denounced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
of superstition, idolatry, and priestcraft; it maintained that to lead a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of purity and high morality was better than all the forms and
ceremonies of religion.

But the very vehemence of its opposition tended to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> about a
reaction. Indeed, the history of all religious movements proves that the
teaching of extreme doctrines of any kind is almost invariably followed
by a Nemesis, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the teacher of them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> himself not live to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it.

At the outset a reformer of the ultra type is sure to gain adherents by
his enthusiasm and earnestness, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as by his ardour in condemning
abuses, but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is almost <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> when his followers will
themselves lapse into the identical practices which it was his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
object to denounce.

At all events, it is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the Buddha’s
followers have invented a mass of complicated forms and ceremonies
wholly out of keeping and incompatible with the purer and simpler system
which he himself sought to establish.

In point of fact the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in promulgating his creed did not <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> into
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> the impossibility of eradicating <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> deep-seated cravings
inherent in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> nature, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> religion aiming at general
acceptance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> reckon with and satisfy:—for example, the craving for
the visible, for the audible, and for the tangible; the craving for some
concrete impersonation of infinite goodness and power; the craving for
freedom from personal responsibility and for its transference to a
priesthood; the craving for deliverance from the pains and penalties of
sin; the craving for an infallible guide in all matters of faith and
doctrine.

Later Buddhism, on the other hand, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> itself to satisfy these
longings—these ineradicable yearnings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> heart. It felt that
it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not establish itself on a firm foundation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hierarchical
organizations, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not maintain these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> external forms,
ceremonies, and ritual observances. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> turned the simple
monastic brotherhood into a caste of priests, and it attracted and
gratified the senses of unthinking multitudes by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> variety of
religious rites, usages, and symbols, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of which are quite unique,
while nearly all are accompanied with superstitious practices implying
an amount of ignorance and credulity on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the people, quite
unparalleled.

This corrupt phase of Buddhism is especially dominant in Tibet,
Mongolia, and Northern countries. In real <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> it <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be affirmed of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Buddhist in Tibet that religious superstition colours all his
thoughts, words, and deeds. It is interwoven with the tissue of his
daily life, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> and parcel of his worldly occupations. It is
equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> and parcel of the national life, and enters into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
Government transaction. Furthermore, it is fostered by <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> and science,
and ministered to by painting and sculpture. Nay, it is stamped on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> itself. It is impressed on rocks, stones, and trees. It finds its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to the summit of snow-clad mountains, to the recesses of
inaccessible ravines, and to the extremities of remote deserts.

To crown all, it <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be affirmed that in Tibet religious superstition
goes on by machinery, quite independently of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> will. It is kept
in continual activity, night and day, by the flapping of flags, and by
the revolution of innumerable wheels and cylinders, which are acted on
by the forces of wind and water.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> easily, therefore, be imagined that to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an exhaustive <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span>
of all the ceremonies and superstitious practices of Tibetan, or, as it

time. They have been treated of by Koeppen in his second volume, and by
Schlagintweit in his ‘Buddhism in Tibet,’ and have been illustrated by
descriptions in Huc’s travels[136], in Markham’s <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the travels
of Bogle, Turner, and Manning, and in the recent narrative of Mr. Sarat
Chandra Das’ Journey. All I can attempt is to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a concise <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of
some of the chief Lamistic observances, taking the books just named as
my authorities, and adding whatever information I have been able to
collect myself from other sources, while travelling in Buddhist
countries.

We must, however, guard against the notion that ceremonial observances
are confined to Tibet and Northern regions. They are now more or less
prevalent in Burma and Ceylon, which have adopted <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the Maha-yana
system, and to these countries we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> attention. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
the ceremonies now observed at the reception of novices and monks in
Burma and Ceylon are less simple than the early admission-forms already
described (pp. 77, 78, 256).

Of course <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> novice has to cut off his hair. He does this to prove
that he is ready to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up the most beautiful and highly-prized of all
his personal ornaments for the sake of a religious life.

But other forms have to be gone through in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day, and I now
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the admission-ceremony of a novice—as performed in

interesting volume <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the Burman[137].’

(p. 77 of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Lectures), a boy ought not to be admitted to the
novitiate until he is fifteen, but in modern times, the admission often
takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at twelve or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> eleven <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, the belief being that

of his secular name, and the receiving of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> title to mark that it
is then possible for him to escape the suffering of life. As he is sure
to have been a scholar or pupil in a monastery (Kyoung) before applying
to be admitted as a novice, he has learnt beforehand all the forms of
worship and <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> that will be required of him during his monastic life;
for instance, that he is to address senior monks in a particular manner
and to wait <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them respectfully; that he is to walk through the
streets keeping his eyes fixed on the ground, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> gazing about, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
if he have to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> a pageant or attractive spectacle of any kind; that
he is to wear his garments in the prescribed fashion; that he is to eat
with moderation and dignity.

On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> appointed for the induction-ceremony, the young neophyte
dresses in his gayest clothes, and mounted on a pony, passes at a foot’s
pace through the town or village. A band of music goes before him, and
all his friends dressed in their best garments, follow in a crowd, the
young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> dancing and singing, the girls smiling and laughing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he
proceeds in procession to the houses of his relations, to bid them
farewell. Of course the introductory observance is intended as a kind of
dramatic imitation of Gautama Buddha’s celebrated abandonment of his own
family and worldly associates, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Mahabhinishkrama?a, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

visits is finished, the would-be novice turns back with all his
companions to his parents’ house. There he finds a large number of
persons assembled, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> them the Head of the monastery, with
several of his brother monks. These are seated on a raised dais in front
of which are the offerings intended for presentation to them, consisting
of fruit, cooked food, yellow cloth, etc.

The monks (‘Talapoins’) seated in a row, carefully hold up their large
fan-like screens to shut out the female portion of the assemblage from
their view. Portions of the Vinaya (p. 62 of this volume) are then
recited, after which the would-be novice is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to throw off all his
fine clothes and bind a piece of white cloth round his loins. Then his
hair is cut off close, and his head is carefully shaved and washed. Next
he is taken to a bath, and after immersion in pure water, is <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
once more, partially clothed, before the assembled monks. Prostrating
himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times before them, he raises his hands in reverence, and,
using the regular Pali <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of words, asks to be admitted to the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
brotherhood. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> that the Head of the monastery presents him with the
yellow monastic garments. These are duly <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> on, and the mendicant’s
bowl is hung round his neck. The ceremony concludes by the formal
announcement of his having <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a member of the monastery.

The <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> admission-ceremony in Ceylon appears to be of a simpler
character. In fact it differs little from the ancient form. Those boys
who are destined for the novitiate usually begin their connexion with
the monastery to which they intend to belong by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> becoming pupils in
the monastery-school. The devotion of the monkhood to the education of
mere boys was perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the best results of the progress and
development of Buddhism. In monasteries, all boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> learn to read and
write[138]. There <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> they gain some experience of monastic duties and
requirements, so that when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes for any pupil to enter the
novitiate, his preparedness is taken for granted. He merely makes <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>
his intention to a superior or senior monk. Then having shaved his head,
and undergone the ceremony of bathing, the applicant, who has furnished
himself with the proper yellow robes, presents them to the superior
monk, and requests to be allowed to receive them again that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a novice. Next, on his reciting the three-refuge formulary, and
the ten prohibitions, he is permitted to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> back the monkish garments
and to <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> them on. He is then formally admitted, and his admission
announced to the other members of the monastery (Hardy’s Eastern
Monachism, p. 23). It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be noted that the monkish garments do not
include a head-covering as in Northern countries.

As to the ceremony of admission to the full monkhood, it differs so
little from the ancient rite (described at p. 79), that no further
description need here be given.

With regard to the religious services performed in the monastic
institutions of modern times, they are, of course, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> advance on
the simple formularies used in early days, before the establishment and
organization of large monasteries.

The earlier and purer Buddhism, as we have seen, had only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> religious
formula, and that was a simple expression of veneration for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
jewels—the Buddha, his Law, and his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Order</span> of Monks (p. 78).

Any <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of worship was altogether out of place, if not a mere mockery,
when there was no supreme Being to worship; when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, who
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> claimed to be more than a perfected man, had passed <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> into
non-existence, and when all that he left behind was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> ideal of
his own memory, to be venerated and imitated.

When, however, monastic establishments were organized and the doctrine
became developed, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> development of worship took place.

To illustrate this I submit a description of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a Burmese
monastery, based on the information <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by Shway Yoe (p. 307), and
often using his words.

It appears that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> monastic community in Burma is roused a little
before daylight by the sound of a big bell, beaten with a wooden mallet.
Each monk has then to rise, rinse out his mouth, wash his hands and
face, arrange his dress (the same in which he has slept all night) and
recite a few formularies, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to the following
effect:—‘How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a favour has the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> bestowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me in
manifesting to me his law, through the observance of which I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> escape
the purgatorial penalties of hell and secure salvation!’ All the members
of the fraternity then station themselves before the image of the
Buddha, with the Abbot at their head, and the rest of the brotherhood,
full monks, novices and scholars, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their order. This done,
they proceed to intone the morning service. At its conclusion each
stands before the Head of the monastery, and pledges himself to observe
during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> all the rules and precepts incumbent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. They then
separate—the pupils and novices to sweep the floor of the monastery,
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> drinking water, filter it, etc., the more advanced novices and
full monks to tend the sacred trees; the elders to meditate in solitude
on the miseries of life, such meditation being beyond all other actions
meritorious. Some gather flowers and offer them before the relic-shrine
(Dagaba).

Then comes a repast, preceded by a grace to the effect that the food is
eaten to satisfy bodily wants, not to please the appetite; that garments
are used to cover nakedness, not for vanity; that health is desired to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> strength for the performance of religious worship and meditation.
After the meal, all devote themselves to study or to teaching. Then
arranging themselves in file, they <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out with the Abbot at their head
to receive their food (not beg). Silently they move on through the
streets, fixing their eyes steadily on the ground six feet before them,
meditating on the vanity and mutability of all things, and only halting
when a layman emerges from some door to pour his contribution of rice or
fruit or vegetables into their alms-bowls. The gift received, not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
or a syllable of thanks is uttered; for is it not the receivers who
confer the favour and not the givers? In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they circle back to
the monastery.

On their return from their perambulation a portion of the food is
offered to the Buddha, and then all proceed to eat the remainder,
consisting perhaps of cooked rice, boiled peas, fish, cocoa-nut cakes,
cucumbers, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> curried flesh and fowl, usually wrapped separately in
plantain-leaves. Next the bowls are washed, and a few hymns are chanted
before the Buddha’s image. During the succeeding hour the boy-scholars
are allowed to play about, while the monks <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in
conversation, and the Abbot receives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to pay their
respects. All visitors prostrate themselves before him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, once
for the Buddha, once for the Law, and once for the Monkhood. The Abbot
in return says: ‘May the supporter’ (so he calls all laymen; compare p.
89), ‘as a reward for merit, be freed from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> calamities (of war,
pestilence, and famine)!’ At about half-past eleven the last regular
meal of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is eaten. Monks are forbidden to eat after noon. When
the mid-day meal is over, all return to work. Some undertake the
teaching of the boy-scholars. <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span> read the texts of the Tri-pi?aka
with their commentaries, or superintend the writers who are copying
manuscripts. Some of the older members of the monastery talk with the
idlers, who are to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> lounging about the precincts, and some sink
into deep meditation, which probably ends in deep sleep.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> this profound meditation is believed to be all important, for is it
not the path to Arhatship, to Nirva?a, and to the acquisition of
supernatural faculties (see p. 245)? Other monks tell the beads of their
rosaries and repeat the prescribed formularies, such as: ‘All is
changeful, all is sorrowful, all is unreal,’ followed by invocations to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> holies (see p. 175). Between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> and four o’clock the
lessons are finished, and the scholars perform any domestic duties
required in the monastery. This is the chief return for the teaching
they receive. Then most of the pupils go to their own homes for dinner.
As to the youthful novices or junior monks, these are all obliged to
fast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the full monks. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of them go out with some of the senior
monks for a solemn walk. Then at sunset the far-reaching notes of the
bell summon the walkers back to the monastery. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
walls before the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> goes down. The day’s duties now draw to a close.
The boy-pupils are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to repeat all they have learned during the day,
and some of the Pali rituals are chanted ‘with spasmodic energy.’ At
half-past eight or nine there are further recitations before the image
of the Buddha. All assemble, as in the morning, and <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> intone the
hymns. When the last sound of the chant has died away, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the

and thrice before the Head of the monastery, and retire to rest (see
Shway Yoe’s ‘Burman’).

It is noteworthy that severe asceticism and painful austerities—as

We now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to a description of the observances usual during the
period of Vassa (see pp. 82-84).

Mr. Dickson has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> us some valuable notes on the method of keeping
this season in Ceylon, and I venture to <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a short narrative on the
information he has communicated[139].

It seems that the villagers of Ceylon esteem it a privilege and a <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

The season begins on the fifteenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the eighth month; that is, on

accommodation, a room for his meals, a temporary chapel for the
reception of the Buddha’s image, of the relic-casket and of the sacred
books, and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in which he can recite the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> and explain it.

where the priest, whom they desire to invite, resides. Thence they
conduct him in procession to their homes. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> act, after his

Then the monk-priest proceeds to the preaching-chamber, in the middle of
which is a chair with a cushion. He takes his seat, and, holding a
screen before his face to prevent his attention being distracted,
commences his recitations. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> sit on the floor—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

the discourses of Buddha, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> generally selected being the
Nidhi-ka??a Sutta (see p. 129). If any listener interposes a remark, or
hints that he does not understand, the priest explains the meaning. The

The monk-priest next repeats to himself the appointed Pirit for the

Kara?iya-metta-sutta (see p. 318), after which he retires to rest for a
few hours. Rising before daybreak, he meditates on the virtues of
Buddha, on goodwill towards all living beings, on the impurities of the
body, and on death, walking up and down in his own chamber, or in any
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> suitable for perambulation. Next he goes to the temporary chapel,
and prostrating himself before the shrine, says, ‘I worship continually
all the relic-shrines, the sacred Bodhi-tree, and the images of Buddha.
I reverence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> jewels’ (see p. 175). He then arranges his
offering of flowers, and places these with a small portion of his
morning meal on the altar. His meal being concluded, he teaches the

Demons are beings who are regarded as created by men, rather than by
God; for they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> in their last state of existence and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

cherishing spiteful and malevolent feelings against the superior race to
which they once belonged; and all kinds of safeguards and counteracting
influences are <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> to be needed to protect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings from their
malignity.

This is quite in keeping with the Hindu theory, which holds that when a

applies equally to women, so that the resulting demons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be of either
sex, and the female is held to be more spiteful than the male.

The most effective of all safeguards against the machinations of such
malignant beings, is believed to be the recitation or intoning of the
Buddha’s Law, and especially of the Sutta (Sutra) division of it already
described (p. 62). And of this division there are choice
portions—twenty-nine in number[141]—supposed to possess greater
prophylactic potency than other portions. Collectively, they constitute
what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Pirit, and of these, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> are most commonly

The Rev. D. J. Gogerley witnessed the performance of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Pirit
ceremony in Ceylon (Hardy’s Monachism, p. 240). Taking his <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> and
that of Mr. Dickson, I have compiled the following brief description of
the Maha-ba?a Pirit, ‘great Pirit recitation’:—

So soon as the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> crowds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> arrive at the
Recitation-Hall, bringing oil-lamps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> out of cocoanut-shells. The
Hall is decorated, and a canopy, shaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a pagoda, is erected over
the pulpits, which are placed on a raised platform. When darkness
supervenes a blaze of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> illuminates the Hall. A relic of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
is deposited on the platform, and a sacred thread is fastened round the
Hall, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> extremity of it being <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> close to the relic and to the
Reciters. On the morning of the next day, the recitations begin. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of
the Reciters repeats the three-refuge formula, and the five commandments
(see pp. 78, 126). Then incense is burnt round the platform, and the
musicians outside the Hall strike up a lively air. Next, the formula of
‘the twelve successive causes of existence’ (see p. 102) is intoned, and
a hymn of victory chanted.

The recitation of the Pirit continues uninterruptedly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night,
for seven days. Twenty-four priests are employed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of whom are
constantly seated on the platform and engaged in reciting. Moreover
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times in each day—at sunrise, mid-day, and sunset—they all
assemble <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> and chant in chorus. Of course, when the recitation of
the Suttas constituting the Pirit is concluded, it is recommenced, and
in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> all the Suttas are recited again and again. On the morning
of the seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> a messenger is sent to a neighbouring temple to
invite the attendance of the gods. Then by a stretch of the imagination
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and spirits are believed to answer the summons, and
on their supposed arrival, the protective Suttas are chanted more
energetically than ever till the morning of the eighth day, when a
benediction concludes the ceremony, and offerings of robes are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to
the priest-reciters.

We now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to Tibet and Mongolia.

The ceremonies of admission to the monkhood in those countries do not
deviate sufficiently from the practices just described to require
special notice.

With regard, however, to the dress of Lamistic monks after their
admission to the Order, the ancient rule, as we have seen, obliged them
to wear only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> garments of a dirty yellowish colour, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> out of
rags, or picked up in cemeteries or on dust heaps. But the necessities
of a colder climate have compelled the Lamas to increase their official
vestments, and the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Lamas sometimes wear bright silken robes
enriched with ornament. The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> is sufficiently obeyed by putting a
patch or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> corner.

A full equipment is supposed to consist of an under vestment, a sort of
tunic worn over it, a mantle, a kind of scarf worn over the left
shoulder, a loose robe <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> round over the same shoulder, and a
cap[142]. The <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> shoulder is rarely bare, as it generally is in
Southern Buddhist countries.

The colour of these six articles of clothing, especially of the cap, is
yellow or red, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the sect to which a monk belongs.

The cap is an important mark of sectarian difference, and is of various
forms, and when it has five points, has been compared to a bishop’s

repetition of prayers—the instrument being then held between the fingers

The efficacy of the Dorje in securing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> fortune and warding off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

was really borrowed from ?aivism or from the Tantra system, introduced
through Nepal by the Red sect. It is easy to understand the enormous

wielders of a formidable thunderbolt, sent to them directly from heaven.

No wonder that the original Dorje preserved at the Sera monastery has
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> an object of actual worship. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to M. Huc, countless

It should be mentioned that the fierce Bodhi-sattva Vajra-pa?i (see p.

Prayer-bell (called Drilbu) employed at the performance of daily
religious ceremonies, and rung to accompany the repetition and chanting
of prayers, or to fill up the intervals of worship. It often has half a
Dorje as a handle, or the handle is ornamented with various mystical
symbols carved on it. The object of ringing bells during worship is to
call the attention of the beings who are worshipped, or to keep off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>

The bell here represented was <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by me from Darjiling.

The bells used in Burma are described at p. 526.

Other religious implements used by novices and lay-brethren, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
by full monks, are prayer-wheels, prayer-cylinders, rosaries, amulets
(see p. 358), drums (see p. 385), and the Phurbu or Phur-pa (pp. 351,
352).

As to the daily religious services and ceremonies performed by Monks in
Tibet and Mongolia, these, of course, are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> more ritualistic than in
southern Buddhist countries. It has already been explained (at pp. 202,
225) that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> abstract essences or mystical forms of the Buddha,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhyani-Buddhas, were imagined to exist, and these had their
concrete energizing vice-gerents <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bodhi-sattvas—beings who
received adoration as if they were actually gods. In Tibet the
Bodhi-sattva Avalokite?vara, and the canonized reformer Tsong Khapa, and
other supposed saints, became prominent objects of religious worship.
Then, in process of time, a complicated ceremonial was developed, which,
as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> (p. 338), has <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in common with the ritual of Roman
Catholic Christianity.

The language employed in the religious services of the Lamistic
Hierarchy, whether in Tibet, Mongolia, or in the Lama monasteries of
China and Manchuria, is Tibetan. In fact, Tibetan is to the Lamistic
Church what Latin is to the Romish. It is the sole orthodox language of
religion and religious ceremonial.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Koeppen, only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Mongolian Lama-monastery (and that
established at Peking) has the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> to perform religious services in
Mongolian instead of in Tibetan[143].

Dr. Edkins, however, states that there is a temple (called Fa-hai-si)
near the hunting-park, in which the Manchu language is employed instead
of Tibetan. (Chinese Buddhism, p. 406.)

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt the acquisition of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Tibetan language
is incumbent on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Lama. Nevertheless, few, except in Tibet, really
understand it. They simply repeat the usual prayers and formularies
mechanically[144].

It appears that the Lamistic priests assemble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to go
through the prescribed ritual—at sunrise, at mid-day, and at sunset. We
read that, before commencing the service, they enter the temple or hall
of worship in procession and seat themselves on low seats in <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> rows.
These are placed the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> length of the hall, from the entrance-door to
the altar, being divided in the middle by a passage. At the further
extremity, close to the altar, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> raised thrones for the Head
Lamas—a five-cushioned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> for the Abbot and a
three-cushioned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> for the Vice-Abbot.

When all have seated themselves, the choir-master or precentor gives a
signal with a bell. Then the prayer-formularies are recited or chanted,
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> passages out of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> are intoned and <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> litanies sung,
sometimes in loud tones, accompanied by noisy music or by clapping of
hands, and generally in unison, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> occasionally verses are sung
alternately with responses.

Then at other times a sentence of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> is repeated by each monk in
turn; or a chant is <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up consisting of such <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> as: Praise be to the
Buddha! or praise be to some Bodhi-sattva! followed by a recital of all
his names, titles, and epithets; or mystical sentences and syllables are
ejaculated. The result is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be a chaos of voices and a deafening
confusion of sounds.

The chief instruments used in the services are a spiral shell, a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
trumpet of copper or brass (sometimes more than ten feet long), a large
drum, flutes, cymbals, and horns—the last being sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the
thigh-bones of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings[145].

The ritual is imposing, and still more so when a living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
present. It has been described by M. Huc, and I here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the substance
of his account[146].

  In front of the chief idol, and on a level with the altar, is a gilded
  seat for the living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> or Grand Lama of the Monastery. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>
  space of the temple, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> to the other, is occupied by <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
  low seats almost level with the ground, stretching <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and left of
  the Grand Lama’s throne. These are covered with carpets, a vacant
  space being left between each row for the Lamas to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> and repass.
  When the hour of prayer is come, a Lama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> office it is to summon
  the choir, places himself in front of the grand entrance of the temple
  and blows with all the force of his lungs into a conch-shell trumpet,
  the sound of which is audible for a league round. This effectually
  rouses the Lamas and calls them together. Each then takes his mantle
  and official hat of ceremony, and repairs to the interior court. The
  trumpet sounds again, and when its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> is heard for the third time,
  the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> door is suddenly thrown open; the living <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> enters, and
  takes his seat in front of the image on the altar. Then the Lamas,
  after depositing their red boots in the vestibule, advance towards him
  barefoot, and adore him by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> prostrations. This done, they seat
  themselves on the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> seats <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their dignity, cross-legged
  and face to face. As soon as the director of the ceremonies has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>
  the signal by tinkling a little bell, everyone murmurs the prescribed
  prayers, unrolling the formularies on his knees. After this
  recitation, there is profound silence for a minute. Then the bell is
  again rung, and a hymn or chant in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> choruses begins. The Tibetan
  prayers, ordinarily arranged in verses, and written in metrical style,
  are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> adapted to harmony; but sometimes at <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> pauses indicated
  by the rubric, the Lama musicians execute a strain in little accord
  with the gravity of the psalmody. The result is a stunning noise of
  bells, cymbals, drums, tambourines, conch-shells, trumpets, and pipes.
  Each musician sounds his instrument with a sort of fury, and each
  strives to outdo his neighbour in the noise he can produce. (Huc’s
  Travels, i. 88, abridged.)

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> important element in some Tibetan religious services is the
consecration and distribution of <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> and grain by the chief
Lamas.

Perfumes, too, are burnt, and censers containing incense are swung
backwards and forwards during the ceremonies.

Then, again, some Lamistic ceremonials include the drinking of tea
poured into little cups, kept in the breast-pockets of the monks’ robes,
and replenished <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times during the service.

Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 208) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> describes a tea-drinking
ceremonial at which he was present, at the monastery of Pemyangchi in
Sikkim (see p. 298 of these Lectures).

  The priests and monks, some thirty-five in all, were drawn up in full
  robes to receive us. Then the officials of the monastery were
  introduced—the steward, the rod-bearer, the deputy master, and lastly,
  the master. A procession was quickly formed, which we followed into
  the chapel, where they all took their accustomed seats, while we sat
  on places prepared for us. The interior of the chapel seemed an odd
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for this, but we were told that it was the correct ceremonial. A
  chant was begun, which lasted some ten minutes, as a sort of grace,
  and then tea was handed round—first to us, next to the priests, and
  lastly to the monks. A short chant followed, and then the procession
  preceded us out of the chapel.

In the picture which accompanies Sir Richard’s description, all the
monks have head-coverings, some of which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> caps or hats of a high
sugar-loaf shape, while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> have several points <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> episcopal mitres
(see p. 321).

The monks of Sikkim are generally of the Dugpa sect[147], and wear red
caps (see pp. 273, 298).

When Dr. Watt was in Ladak, he was <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> at a service performed by a
number of monks belonging to both sects, who seemed to fraternize very
amicably. All the monks of the red sect took up a position on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side
of the chapel, while those of the yellow sect ranged themselves on the
opposite side. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects entered together, as usual, in procession,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the ceremonial—as in that witnessed by Sir Richard
Temple—consisted in drinking tea from little cups taken from the folds
of their robes, and <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> back again, to be again taken out and
replenished; and this, too, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interrupting the continuous
repetition of prayers, chants, and formularies[148].

M. Huc <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> describes a ‘Tea-general’ ceremony after morning service in
a temple. Each monk drinks in silence, carefully placing his scarf
before his cup, as if to prevent the sight of the apparent incongruity
of drinking tea in such a sacred spot (ii. 57).

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> instance of tea-drinking as an element in Lamistic ceremonial,
occurs in Mr. Sarat Chandra Das’ highly interesting <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the
ceremony of his presentation to the Dalai Lama at the palace-monastery
of Potala, in Lhassa, on June 10, 1882. I venture to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the substance
of it in an abbreviated <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> and not quite literally[149].

An <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of other presentations both to the Dalai Lama and Tashi Lama
will be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in a future Lecture (see pp. 439, 444, 447).

  Early in the morning I was informed of the arrival of Chola Kusho, who
  was ready to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> me to Potala for presentation to the Dalai Lama. We
  sallied <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> on horseback, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> bundles of incense-sticks in
  our hands, and a roll of scarves in our breast-pockets, chanting as we
  <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> along <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> hymns, and particularly the mystic ‘Om ma?i padme
  Hum.’ In the street we saw a calf sucking milk, and several women
  fetching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> in our direction. My companions were delighted at these
  auspicious omens. Arrived at the eastern gateway of Potala, we
  dismounted, and walked up a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> hall, on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides of which were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
  rows of prayer-wheels, <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> there to be twirled, on going in and coming
  out.

  A young monk now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> down to conduct us, and we ascended slowly,
  looking only on the ground before us. The several ladders which
  conducted us from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> story to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> were steep, and placed in dark
  halls. I counted five, which took us as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the ground-floor of the
  Red palace. Half-a-dozen ladders still remained to be scaled.

  At about eight we reached the top, and there <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a number of monks
  anxiously awaiting an interview with his Holiness. A seat was pointed
  out to me. A monk sat near me, and smilingly observed that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
  have been on <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the sins of my former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that I was born in
  India, where there is no living Buddha.

  From the top of the Red palace we enjoyed a grand panorama of Lhassa
  and its suburbs. Shortly afterwards some Lamas of high rank, dressed
  in loose yellow mantles, arrived. They entered the hall of reception
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> after <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> in solemn array. We remained outside in anxious
  suspense, fixing our eyes on the entrance door, and expecting to be
  summoned to his Holiness’ presence.

  At last, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Lamas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> towards us and asked us to enter in a line
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> after another. Walking very gently, we proceeded to the middle of
  the audience hall—a spacious apartment supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> rows of four
  wooden pillars. The walls had paintings of the exploits of Buddha, of
  Chanrassig[150], Tsong Khapa, and other celebrated saints, besides
  images of the successive incarnations of the Dalai Lama.

  As soon as we had entered the official scarf-collectors received the
  presentation-scarves from our hands. We seated ourselves on rugs,
  spread in about eight rows, my seat being in the third row, at a
  distance of about ten feet from the Grand Lama’s throne, and a little
  to his left. When all were seated, perfect silence reigned in the
  grand hall. The state officials walked from left to <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> with serene
  gravity, as became their exalted rank, in the presence of the Supreme
  Vice-Regent of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> on earth. At their head walked the Kuchar
  Khanpo, who carried in his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> the bowl of benediction, containing
  the sacred Thui (that is, consecrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> stained yellow with
  saffron) for sprinkling over the audience. The bearer of the
  incense-pot, suspended by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> golden chains, the carrier of the
  royal golden tea-pot, and other domestic officials, now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up, and
  stood motionless as pictures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> looking on either side, but
  fixing their eyes and their attention, as it were, on the tips of
  their respective noses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large golden lamp-burners, resembling
  flower-vases, flickered on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides of the throne. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
  altar—resembling an oriental throne, and supported by lions[151]
  carved in wood—on which sat his Holiness, a child of eight, was
  covered with silk scarves of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> value. It was about four feet high,
  six long, and four broad. A yellow mitre-hat[152] covered the Grand
  Lama’s head, the pendant portions veiling his ears, and a yellow
  mantle enveloped his person. He sat cross-legged, with the palms of
  his hands joined <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> to bless us. When it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to my turn I
  received his Holiness’ benediction, and was able to look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> face. Other Lamas approached him with downcast looks, and
  resumed their respective seats, not presuming to look up. I longed to
  linger a few seconds, but other candidates for benediction displaced
  me by pushing me gently forward. I noticed that the princely child
  possessed a really bright and fair complexion, with rosy cheeks. His
  eyes were large and penetrating. The contour of his face was
  remarkably Aryan, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> somewhat marred by the obliquity of his eyes.
  The thinness of his person was probably owing to the fatigues of the
  court-ceremonies, religious duties, and ascetic observances, to which
  he had been subjected <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> taking the vows of monkhood. Remembering
  the stories about the freaks of fortune, which had lately <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him
  to this proud position, and had compelled his predecessors to undergo
  untimely transmigrations, I pitied his exalted rank: for who knows
  whether he will not be forced to undergo <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> transmigration before
  reaching his twentieth year?

  When all were again seated after receiving the Dalai Lama’s
  benediction, the Sol-pon Chhenpo poured tea in his Holiness’ golden
  cup from a golden tea-pot, while four assistant Sol-pons poured tea in
  the cups of the audience, consisting of the head Lamas of Meru
  monastery and ourselves. Before the Grand Lama lifted his cup to his
  lips, a grace was solemnly said, beginning with ‘Om ah Hum’ thrice
  chanted, and followed by a prayer to the following effect:—‘Never <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

  breast-pockets. Then the Sol-pon placed a golden dish full of
  consecrated rice in front of his Holiness, which he only touched. The
  remainder was distributed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> those present. I obtained a handful,

  grace was then uttered by the assembled monks, with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> gravity:—‘The
  most precious _Buddha_ is the most perfect and matchless teacher; the

It appears that a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> well-known Khanpo had died of small-pox. He
was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most distinguished scholars of Tibet, and held the

was performed was the twenty-seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of this chief Lama’s _Bardo_

of the intermediate state only lasts for forty days.)

The Dalai Lama, seated on his throne, chanted a hymn in a low indistinct
voice. Afterwards the assembled monks in grave tones repeated what the
Grand Lama had uttered. Then a venerable personage rose from the middle
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> row of seats, and addressing the Grand Lama as the

mercy performed by him, as the patron-saint of Tibet, for the benefit of
its people. Next, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> offerings of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> precious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

saying:—‘I pray that you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> graciously accept these presents for the

Finally, he prostrated himself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times before the Grand Lama’s
throne. A solemn pause followed; after which the audience rose, and the
Grand Lama retired. Mr. Sarat Chandra Das goes on to relate that at the
<span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the ceremony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the assistant Lamas gave him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> packets of

he was told, were chinlab or blessings, consecrated by the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and
other saints; and the consecrated scrap of silk, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> sungdu, ‘knot of

then Dalai Lama. He was a handsome boy about thirteen <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old, and was
seated on a throne six feet high. He had the Regent on his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> hand.
He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be in his thirteenth transmigration[154].

Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 239) describes a ceremony in which consecrated
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> (thui) is poured from a teapot-like vessel over a metallic mirror
(pp. 458, 463 of these Lectures), which is held so as to reflect the
image of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> seated on the altar. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> falls down into
a flat vessel containing a bag filled with rice, and is then suitable
for ceremonial ablutions.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> ceremony (called Nyungne? by Schlagintweit), involving <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
abstinence, lasts for four days.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and second <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> are passed in preparations. Those who are to

themselves several times before the image of Avalokite?vara. The head
Lama then bids them confess their faults, and meditate on the evils
resulting from demerit. He next, with his attendants, recites extracts
from <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> books of confession. This goes on till ten o’clock, when
tea is taken. After this the recitations and prayer-recitals continue
till <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> o’clock, when a meal of vegetables is eaten. Then comes a
pause, but the prayers and readings are afterwards carried on till late
at night, tea being handed round at intervals. Before retiring to rest,
the head Lama specifies the various duties to be performed by the
devotees on the following day, and orders them, as a penance, to sleep
in ‘the lion-posture,’ viz. to lie on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side, to stretch out the
feet and to support the head with the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> hand[155].

The third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is the most important, and is passed in rigorous
abstinence from all food. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> allowed to swallow his saliva,
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be ejected into a vessel placed before him. Not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
be spoken. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> prays and confesses his sins, but does so in
absolute silence. This continues till sunrise on the fourth day.

It was at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the rule that repetitions of the Law, confessions of sin
(especially the Patimokkha), and some of the chief religious ceremonies
(including fasting) should <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> place, more particularly on the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of

(Mahasudassana-sutra, 1-10). This was in conformity with the ancient
Brahmanical rule that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> new-moon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> (Dar?a) and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> full-moon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
(Paur?amasa) should be <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> apart for special religious observances[156].

In later times the intermediate quarter-moon <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> held sacred,
and so the number of Uposatha <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> (see p. 84) was increased to four in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> month, or once a week. Very strict Buddhists in Tibet eat <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span>
on these <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> between sunrise and sunset except farinaceous food with
tea (p. 346).

The laity are invited to join in keeping the Uposatha days, but <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> no

religious ceremonies. Laymen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> at any rite, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

short prayers—such as the ‘three-refuge’ and ‘jewel-lotus’ formula (pp.
78, 370)—and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> declarations to avoid the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sins (p. 126).

it and receive the Lama’s benediction. Theoretically, the laity only
exist to honour and support the monkhood, and to be blessed by them in
return. At all events a layman’s religion is usually restricted to a
very limited range of duty.

utmost severity of the weather does not <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> any obstacle to their
courageous devotion. They continue their prostrations through rain,
snow, and cold. Sometimes they go through the additional penance of
carrying an enormous weight of books on their backs. You meet with men,
women, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> sinking under these excessive burdens. When
they have finished their circumambulation, they are considered to have
acquired the same merit as if they had recited all the prayers contained
in the books they have carried.’ In point of fact they are generally <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
too ignorant to be able to read the books, and the carrying of them on
their backs is taken as an adequate equivalent.

The acquisition of merit by circumambulation is not an exclusively Hindu
or Buddhist idea. The <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> at Loretto near Ancona—believed to have
been transported there from Bethlehem by angels—is circumambulated by
pilgrims on their knees, but keeping the sacred object to the left.
Indeed, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> fitly conclude the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Lecture by a comparison
between the ritual of Tibetan Buddhism and that of Roman Catholicism—a
comparison, too, drawn by the Roman Catholic Missionaries themselves:

‘The cross, the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope, which Grand Lamas wear
on their journeys, or when they are performing some ceremony out of the
temple; the service with double choirs, the psalmody, the exorcisms, the
censer for incense, suspended from five chains, and opened or closed at
pleasure; the benedictions pronounced by the Lamas by extending the

celibacy, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> retirement, the worship of the saints, the fasts,
the processions, the litanies, the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> water, all these are analogies
between the Buddhists and ourselves’ (Huc, ii. 50). To these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
added sacred images, sacred pictures, sacred symbols, relics, lamps, and
illuminations[157].

opinion which the missionaries express—‘that these analogies are of
Christian origin’—is equally deserving of our assent. No doubt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> chief

                             LECTURE XIII.
        _Festivals, Domestic Rites, and Formularies of Prayer._


We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> now turn to the consideration of some of the chief festivals,
domestic rites, and prayer-formularies of Buddhism—a subject which
follows as a natural sequel to the last Lecture.

It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that the Hindus have <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> festivals and <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> days,
celebrated at the junction of the seasons which in India are properly
six in number—namely, spring, summer, the rains (Varsha), autumn,
winter, and the season of dew and mist (see ‘Indian Wisdom,’ p. 450;
‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 428).

Buddhism has adopted the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Hindu ideas on this subject, and has added
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> of its own, but generally only reckons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> seasons—summer, the
rains (Vassa = Varsha) and winter.

The festival of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year is, of course, universal. It is supposed to
celebrate the victory of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> over darkness, and, in Buddhist
countries, of Buddhism over ignorance. The corresponding Hindu festival
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Makara-sa?kranti. In India this marks the termination of the
inauspicious month Pausha and the beginning of the sun’s northern course
(uttaraya?a) in the heavens. It is a season of general rejoicing.

In Burma, where a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> type of Southern Buddhism is still to be found,
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year’s festival <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> suitably be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a ‘water-festival.’ It
has there so little connexion with the increase of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year’s light,
that it often takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as late as the early half of April (see Mr.
Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii. 48). It is, however, a movable feast, the date of
which is regularly fixed by the astrologers of Mandalay, ‘who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>
intricate calculations based on the position of various constellations.’
The object is to determine on what precise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Naths
(see p. 217 of this volume) will descend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and inaugurate
the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> year. When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> arrives all are on the watch, and just at the
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> moment—which invariably occurs at midnight—a cannon is fired off,
announcing the descent of the Nath-king <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. Forthwith (according
to Mr. Scott) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women sally out of their houses, carrying pots
full of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> consecrated by fresh leaves and twigs of a sacred tree (p.
514 of this volume), repeat a formal prayer, and pour out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> on
the ground. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> all who have guns of any kind discharge
them, so as to greet the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> year with as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> noise as possible.

Then, ‘with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> glimmer of light,’ all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> jars full of fresh

usually done by the women of the party, ‘who reverently clamber up’ and
empty their goblets of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> over the placid features of the Buddhas and
Bodhi-sattvas. Then begin the Saturnalia. All along the road are urchins
with squirts and syringes, with which they have been furtively
practising for the last few days. The skill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> acquired is exhibited
by the accuracy of their aim. Cold streams of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> catch the ears of

Before breakfast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is soaked, but no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thinks of changing his
garments, for the weather is warm, and ‘water is everywhere.’ The girls
are the most enthusiastic, and as they generally go in bands and carry
copious reservoirs along with them, ‘unprotected males’ are soon routed.
Then a number of ‘zealous people’ go down to the river, wade into the

clothes. The wetting is a compliment. A clerk comes up to his master,
bows, and ‘gravely pours the contents of a silver cup down the back of
his neck,’ saying, ‘let me do homage to you with water.’

It appears from Mr. Scott’s amusing narrative that, when there was a

and, as usual, is a season of general festivity, gifts, congratulations,
mummery, dancing, and acting. It is the Lamistic carnival.

midnight. At Lhassa all the inhabitants sit up, awaiting the solemn
moment which is to close the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> year and open the new. The usages
differ so curiously from those customary in Southern Buddhist countries,
that I here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an abbreviated version of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> French travellers’

  wrapped in profound slumber, when we were suddenly awakened by cries
  of joy issuing from all quarters of the town. Bells, cymbals, conchs,
  tambourines, and all the instruments of Tibetan music, were <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> to

  of Lhassa, but the cold was so cutting that, after reflection, we
  decided to remain under our woollen coverlets, and to unite ourselves
  in <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> only with the public felicity. Unhappily for our comfort,
  violent knocks on our door, threatening to smash it into splinters,
  warned us that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> renounce our project.

  were not in the habit of taking food during the night, but they
  entreated us so warmly, and <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> out their tongues at us with so
  friendly a grace, that we were obliged to comply, and resign ourselves
  to a participation in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year’s festivities. Each of us,
  therefore, hooked a ball, which we then crushed between our teeth to
  ascertain its flavour. For politeness sake we had to swallow the dose,
  but not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> making some grimaces.

The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year was inexorable. Our numerous
  friends at Lhassa succeeded each other almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interruption,

the invasion of the town and its environs by innumerable bands of Lamas.
Immense numbers of Lamas, some on foot, some on horseback, some on asses
or oxen, and all carrying cooking-utensils and prayer-books, crowd into
Lhassa from all points. The town is completely over-run. Those who
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> get lodgings encamp in the streets and squares, or pitch their
tents in the suburbs. The tribunals are closed, and the course of
justice is suspended. The Lamas parade the streets in disorderly bands,
uttering discordant cries, pushing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> about, quarrelling,
fighting, and yet, in the midst of all, chanting their prayers (Huc, ii.
218).

In Tibet there is a ‘water-festival’ in the seventh or eighth month
(about our August and September). At this festival the Lamas go in
procession to rivers and lakes, and consecrate the waters by benediction
or by throwing in offerings. Huts and tents are erected on the banks,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> bathe and drink to wash <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> their sins. It concludes with
dancing, buffoonery, and masquerading.

The festival of Gautama Buddha’s conception, or of the Buddha’s _last_
birth—for it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that, before Buddhahood, he <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
through innumerable previous births—is a most important anniversary in
all Buddhist countries, but the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> date has been the occasion of <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
controversy. The event is generally celebrated at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of April, or
beginning of May, or on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> corresponding to the 15th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the Hindu
month Vai?akha, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> sometimes <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> as the date of the
Buddha’s attainment of Buddhahood, and of his death. Everywhere

the worship of his images, followed by processions.

As to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of his death, Sarat Chandra Das was at Lhassa on June 1,
1882, and wrote thus:—‘To-day being the holiest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the year—the
anniversary of Buddha’s Nirva?a—the burning of incense in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> shrine,

his blessing.’

The ‘festival of lamps’ is an important anniversary with all Buddhists.
The Hindus have their Divali or feast of illuminations (see ‘Brahmanism
and Hinduism,’ p. 432) when the cold season begins. The early Buddhists
marked the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the rainy season (Vassa = Varsha), which terminated
their period of retirement, by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of rejoicing (see p. 84). In
process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they connected the celebration of Gautama’s descent from
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (p. 417) with the termination of Vassa.

In Tibet the orthodox followers of the Dalai Lama have a festival of
their own, with illuminations, on the 25th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the 10th month
(Nov.—Dec.), to celebrate the ascension of Tsong Khapa to <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> (p.
280). Sarat Chandra Das was at Tashi Lunpo on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in 1881, when
‘hundreds of lamp-burners were tastefully placed in rows on the roof of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> building.’ The illuminations of the temples, tombs, and grand
monastery ‘presented a magnificent appearance.’

With regard to the season <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vassa, it should be noted here that
<span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> there is no rainy period of the year in Tibet which corresponds to
the Indian ‘Rains,’ <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> seasons of abstinence from food are observed
either before, or at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Festivals. These
periods of fasting are distributed equally throughout the year—one in
February, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in May, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in July, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in November or December.

The festivals and <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> briefly described, are by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the
only festivals of Buddhism. There are numerous other special and local
ones. For example, in Ceylon, the Sinhalese celebrate the coming of the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> to their island and his victory over the Rakshasas and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
demons by a festival in March or April, when the greater number of
pilgrims flock to his supposed foot-print on Adam’s Peak, or to the
sacred Bodhi-tree at Anuradha-pura (see p. 519). Other Southern
countries have festivals connected with the worship of special
foot-prints and relics of their own.

Then the Lamas in Lhassa keep the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the worship of the Dorje (see
p. 322) on the 27th <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> month, while those in Sikkim
celebrate as a festival the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> on which the Lepchas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> offerings to
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the mountain Kinchinjunga.

Then, again, at the beginning of the third month an exhibition of sacred
vessels and pictures takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at Lhassa, accompanied by processions
in masks, the Lamas appearing as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genii, and the laity as tigers,
leopards, elephants, &c.

In other places, too, there are special festivals. For example, a
singular festival, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Chase of the spirit-kings,’ is kept by
Northern Buddhists on the 30th of the second month, when there is a vast
amount of religious dancing (with tediously slow movements),
masquerading, mummery, and buffoonery, not unlike the devil-dancing
which goes on in Ceylon, and closely connected with the universal belief
in demons and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits.

The most hideous masks are used on these occasions. In 1884 I had an
opportunity of inspecting in a Buddhist monastery near Darjiling a most
singular assortment of religious masks, which for distortion of feature
and horrible unsightliness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> scarcely be matched anywhere; for
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> mask-making is an <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> which Buddhism has <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to the greatest
perfection. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> witnessed a religious dance performed by a party of
masqueraders which struck me as a remarkable example of the utter
debasement of Buddhism in Northern countries.

Mrs. Bridges describes a similar religious dance in Ladak thus:—

  ‘A group of grinning masks—lions’ heads and harlequins’ bodies—came
  down the steps, and whirling slowly round, retreated again into the
  gloom and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> out dragon-headed. Then a band of skeletons, the skulls
  (masks) admirably painted, gnashing their hideous jaws and shaking
  their lanky limbs, rushed out into the sunshine and executed a real
  “Dance of Death” before us.’ (‘Travels,’ p. 101.)

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhists are prohibited from dancing and masquerading (p.
126 of this volume); just as Manu (II. 178, IV. 15, 212) prohibited
Brahmans from engaging in similar frivolities.

Then the religious dramas performed on some of the Buddhist festive <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span>
are not the least interesting examples of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> prevalent
superstitions.

I witnessed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a dramatic performance at a Burmese Theatre in
Calcutta (during the Exhibition year), when the story of the Hindu Epic,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ramaya?a, and especially that portion of it which relates to the
carrying off of Sita by demons (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 42,
and ‘Indian Wisdom,’ p. 337), was dramatically represented. The theatre
was a rude wooden enclosure open to the sky, with the exception of a
portion roofed over for a band of musicians, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> noisy performances
appeared to constitute an important element in the proceedings. The
chief musician sat on the ground in the middle of a circular
frame-work—about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> feet high—hung round with drums of
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> sizes, which he struck with his hands, and occasionally tuned
by the application of moist clay in larger or smaller lumps. In the
centre of the open area of flat dusty soil which served for the stage, a
big branch of a tree was stuck upright, possibly to represent the forest
in which Rama lived with his wife. Then the hero and heroine of the
drama—Rama and Sita—kept up a tedious colloquy, interspersed with jokes,
for hours. The former—who, be it remembered, was supposed to be a
god—smoked a cigar all the while, and occasionally ejected saliva with
perfect indifference to all appearances and to all laws of congruity,
while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> now and again Sita, in spite of a tight dress, varied the
monotony of the dialogue by executing a slow dance, characterized by
strange contortions, twistings, and wrigglings of the limbs. Hideous
masks were at intervals assumed by the actors, and, of course, by the
demons who intervened at odd moments with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> ludicrous gesticulation.
The action of the play <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> on continuously for about ten days, during
which period <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> and <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> as they liked, and the last comers
entered into the progress of the plot with as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> interest as if they
had witnessed the whole. There is <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> originality of invention in
these religious plays. The Indian heroic poems and the five hundred and
fifty birth-stories (see p. 63) of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> furnish the basis of all.

The religious dramas of Tibet are of a somewhat <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> character. The
following description is founded on Dr. Schlagintweit’s <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> (p.
233), and on that of Mrs. Bridges in her interesting ‘Travels’ (John
Murray, 1883, p. 130).

  The dramatis personæ consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> classes.—1. Tutelary deities or

  distinguished by their masks. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> class—that is the Dragsheds or

  colour, and their garments are <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> padded to deaden the force of the

  usual dress of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings, and masks of a natural size and colour,
  while under their clothes they carry heavy wooden sticks, with which
  at times, during the progress of the drama, they belabour the demons.
  The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> get <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> knocked about by the demons, <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to the
  amusement of the spectators.

  The drama is preceded by the recital of hymns and prayers and by noisy
  music. The Dragsheds occupy the centre, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are on their <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and

  execute slow dances, each group by itself. At last, an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and

  an unusually large yellow mask, advances against them surrounded by
  about a dozen followers. Other Dragsheds next rush out from the
  back-ground, shoot arrows, throw stones, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with muskets

This curious dramatic performance is paralleled in India by the Hindu
drama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Prabodha-candrodaya, ‘Rise of the moon of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> knowledge,’
in which we have Faith, Volition, Opinion, Imagination, Contemplation,
Devotion, Quietude, Friendship, &c., on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side; Error, Self-conceit,
Hypocrisy, Love, Passion, Anger, Avarice, on the other. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sets of
characters are, of course, opposed to each other, the object of the play
being to show how the orthodox faith of the Hindus became victorious
over the erroneous doctrine of the Buddha—the Buddhists and other
heretical sects being represented as adherents of the losing side.

Then—to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> a parallel nearer home—we find similar religious dramas
acted in England not so very <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> ago (about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Henry VIII).
For example, in the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> English morality play, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Every-man,’ some

Fellowship, Kindred, Good-deeds, Knowledge, Confession, Beauty,
Strength, Discretion; while on the other are personifications of the
opposite qualities. Then, again, in ‘Lusty Juventus,’ we have a medley
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> Counsel, Knowledge, Satan, Hypocrisy, Fellowship, Abominable

In Burma the tattooing of mystical squares, triangles and cabalistic

as a sufficient substitute for the use of magical weapons, and is held
to be highly efficacious.

                      _Domestic Rites and Usages._

I now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to domestic rites and usages, which are as numerous and
important in Buddhist countries as in India. It is said, indeed, that in
Tibet and Mongolia no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is so poor as not to possess an altar in his
dwelling on which he daily lays his offerings, and before which he
performs devotions.

In Ceylon and Burma <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> ceremonies <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> soon after the birth
of a child. Mr. Scott, describing those in Burma, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that a fortnight
after birth a fortunate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and hour is fixed by an astrologer for the
naming of the infant. A feast is prepared, and all the friends and
relations of the family are invited. ‘The child’s head is usually washed
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> on this day,’ and some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> suggests a name.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> actually <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> appears to be a matter of choice, but this is
not so. The consonants of the language are divided into groups, which
are assigned to the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the week, Sunday having all the vowels to
itself. ‘It is an invariable rule in all respectable families that the

common belief is that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the week (or rather the
constellation representing that day) on which a child is born, so will
its character be.

In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> person’s probable characteristics <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be inferred. For
example, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> born on a Monday is likely to be jealous; on Tuesday,
honest; on Wednesday, hot-tempered—but soon appeased—this characteristic
being intensified under the influence of Rahu[162].

Then, again, if born on a Thursday, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> will probably be mild; on
Friday, talkative; on Saturday, ill-tempered and quarrelsome; on Sunday,
parsimonious. Saturday is a bad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> for everything.

(according to Mr. Scott) a particular animal assigned to symbolize
it—for example, a guinea-pig stands for Friday; a dragon for Saturday; a
tiger for Monday—and red or yellow wax candles are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in the forms of
these animals to be offered at the Pagoda by the pious. Each worshipper
offers the creature-candle representing his birth-day.

Then a careful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the exact hour of birth, with the
important object of drawing up the child’s horoscope. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

He records the year, the month, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and
hour at which the child was born; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to it and the planet in
the ascendant at the moment. All this is scratched neatly on a palm-leaf
with a metal style. On the other side are a number of cabalistic squares
and numbers from which future calculations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be made.

A person born on Monday remains under the influence of the moon for
fifteen years. Then he passes under Mars for eight years. At the age of
twenty-three Mercury presides over him, and so on through all the
planets to the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of his life, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be protracted to 108 years.

Rahu, and especially Saturn, have a particularly sinister influence. A
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does most of the stupid and wicked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> while he is in
Saturn’s house. Other details will be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in ‘Shway Yoe.’

The horoscope is carefully kept by the parents until the child is <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span>
enough to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> care of it himself, and thenceforward it is guarded as a
valuable possession.

All these Buddhist customs have their counterpart in the ceremonies of
Brahmanism and Hinduism.

For example, the Hindus have their birth-ceremonies (Jata-karman), and
their name-giving ceremony (Nama-kara?a[163]), and the latter is a
solemn religious act fraught with momentous consequences in its bearing
on a child’s future. Hence Hindu boys are generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> after some
god, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> indicates that the child is the god’s servant.
Horoscopes, too, are as important in India as in Buddhist
countries[164].

In India, too, all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> boys go through the ceremony of tonsure and
cutting off the hair.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the Buddhists of Burma a boy is sent to the monastery school at
about the age of eight. Before he can <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a novice he has to undergo
the hair-abscission ceremony, followed by shaving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> fort-night (as
before described). But those who afterwards elect to lead a secular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
wear <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> hair, to wash which is regarded as a kind of religious
ceremonial, and only to be performed about once a month, partly, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span>
Mr. Scott, because the washing of a Burman’s luxuriant hair takes a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
time, and partly because too frequent ablutions ‘would disturb and
irritate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> genius who dwells in the head and protects the man.’

It is considered unlucky to wash the head on a Monday, Friday, or
Saturday; and ‘parents sending their boy to a monastery <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> remember
not to cut his hair off on a Monday, or on a Friday, or on his
birth-day.’

It is noticeable that a kind of baptism is practised in Tibet and
Mongolia. It is usual to sprinkle <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> with consecrated water, or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to immerse them entirely on the third or tenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> after birth.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Khrus-sol (according to Jäschke).

The priest consecrates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> by reciting some formula, while candles
and incense are burning. He then dips the child <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times, blesses it,
and gives it a name. After performing the ceremony, he draws up the
infant’s horoscope.

Then, so soon as the child can walk and talk, a second ceremony takes
place, when prayers are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> for its happy life, and an amulet or little
bag is hung round its neck, filled with spells and charms against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
spirits and diseases.

The use of _amulets_ (Sansk?it kavaca), charms and spells in Northern
Buddhist countries is universal.

At Darjiling I noticed that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the crowds of persons who frequented
the bazaar—many of whom were travellers from Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and
Sikkim—almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> wore an amulet, or a string of amulets round the
neck. Most of these amulets are simply ornamental boxes or receptacles
for supposed relics of saints, or for little images, or pictures, or for
prayer-formularies, worn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> breast-plates or phylacteries. They are
composed of wood, bone, and not infrequently of beautifully-worked
filigree silver, embossed and ornamented with turquoise. The shape is
sometimes square, sometimes circular or curved, and <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> round to a
point[165]. I purchased several specimens, but the vendor of any amulet
in actual use invariably removed the contents before consenting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span>
with it. Here is a specimen of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of exceptionally beautiful design
which was <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to me by Mr. Sarat Chandra Das. It was taken from the
neck of a woman in the bazaar, but not purchased <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>

We <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on next to the Buddhist _marriage-ceremony_. This in Ceylon,
Burma, Tibet, Mongolia, and <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> in all Buddhist countries, is
properly a purely civil contract witnessed only by parents and
guardians. We have already pointed out, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism considers
celibacy to be the only sure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of attaining real sanctity of
character. Consistently with this idea, it has not prescribed any
religious ceremony to be performed by monks or priests, as a condition
of the validity of marriage[166].

Hence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Buddhists the ceremony of marriage is very simple, and has
no religious character, or at any rate no complicated religious
observances connected with it, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the Hindus[167]. In fact the
celibate monks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> scandalized if they were
asked to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in the celebration of a wedding, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to ratify it
by their presence.

The principal ceremony consists in a feast <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by the bridegroom or
his parents, to which all the relations, friends, and neighbours are
invited. Nevertheless, in most Buddhist countries in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the
monks manage to have some remunerative <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> to do in connexion with
weddings; for their business is to fix the most auspicious <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> for the
performance of the ceremony, in return for which they receive offerings
of various kinds. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that in India astrology is a chief factor in
all marriage-arrangements. Similarly in most Buddhist countries no
wedding can <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> till the astrologer, who is usually a
monk-priest, has been consulted as to lucky and unlucky combinations,
and the benign or baleful aspects of planets and stars. For example, in
Burma, Saturdays and Thursdays are pronounced unlucky days, and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be the height of imprudence to marry in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> months of the year.
Then, again, a woman born on a Friday <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be guilty of utter folly if
she married a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> born on a Monday, seeing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon
die[168]; and so on through a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> list of auspicious and inauspicious
potentialities.

It should, however, be <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> down to the credit of Buddhism that wives and
daughters are not imprisoned in Zananas, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Hindus and
Muhammadans. I was <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> at an evening-party <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by a rich native of
Ceylon, when the ladies of the family were introduced to the European
guests, and conversed freely with the rest of the company. Nor is the
marriage of mere boys and girls insisted on in Buddhist countries as in
India. The bridegroom is seldom of a less age than eighteen or nineteen.

Then, again, not only births and marriages, but illnesses and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> are

First, as to _sickness_.

In Ceylon, when any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is dangerously ill, the monk-priest is summoned
from the neighbouring Vihara, after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sending offerings of flowers,
oil, and food. Then a temporary preaching-place is erected near the
house, and all the relatives and friends, and if possible the sick <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
himself, listen to the reading of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (Ba?a) for about six hours.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> especially read and intoned is the Ratna-valiya section of the
Pirit (see p. 317). After the Ba?a a number of offerings are <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to
the reciting priest, including a piece of calico, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of which is
held by the priest, and the other by the sick man. Then the priest
pronounces a benediction, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the following effect:—‘By
reverence do the wise secure health, by almsgiving do they lay up
treasures for themselves[169].’

When the sick <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is likely to die the priest repeats the Three-refuge
formula (p. 78), the five commandments (p. 126), and the Sati-pa??hana
Sutta (p. 49).

In Burma, if an epidemic happens to break out in any village, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

with a heavy stick[170]. Then as soon as it gets dark all the villagers
shout, yell, shriek, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> kind of deafening din, with the hope

there are 140 <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> maladies, and that most of these are caused by
devils. The monk-priests are the sole doctors, and a sick person can
only be cured by them. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> process is simple. It begins by the Lama
doctor writing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of a remedy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a morsel of paper, moistening
it with saliva, and rolling it into a pill. The patient takes the paper
pellet with as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> faith as if he were swallowing the veritable drug.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> Mongols believe that ‘it is precisely the same, whether you swallow
a drug or its written appellation.’ Then, ‘if the patient be poor, the
devil is a little one, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be dislodged by a few prayers; but, if he
be rich, the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> is different; fine clothes, handsome boots, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a

A very effective medicine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be composed of the bones of some pious
Lama ground into a powder. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> alone or in combination
with other substances.

It appears to be essential that the prayers recited on these occasions
should be accompanied by terrific noises. M. Huc relates a story of an
<span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> woman—the aunt of a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> chief—who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> attacked by
intermittent fever. The Lama, of course, announced that a devil had
possession of her body; and so in the evening he and eight other Lamas
began operations for its expulsion. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a little figure or
manikin of dried herbs, which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the devil of intermittent
fevers. This they stuck upright in the tent of the sick woman. Then at
eleven o’clock at night the Lamas ranged themselves at the back of the
tent, armed with bells, tambourines, conch-shells, and other noisy
instruments. Nine members of the family closed the circle in front,
crouching on the ground, while the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> woman remained seated on her
heels in front of the manikin. Next, ‘at a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> signal, the orchestra
performed an overture capable of scaring <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the most imperturbable and
obstinate devil, while all the secular assistants beat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with their
hands to the hubbub of the instruments and the howling of the prayers.
When this demoniacal music was over, the chief Lama began his exorcisms,
scattering millet seeds around as he proceeded; sometimes speaking low,
sometimes in stentorian tones. Then, appearing to throw himself into a
passion, he addressed animated appeals, with violent gesticulation, to
the manikin.’ Finally, after further incantations, he gave a signal; the
Lamas thundered out a noisy chorus, the instruments added to the din,
and the members of the family rushing out in file, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the circuit of
the tent, striking it frantically with stakes, and uttering terrific
cries. Finally, the chief Lama and his assistants, after joining in the
yells, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the manikin. This ended the ceremony; the demon being
compelled to beat a retreat.

Mr. Sarat Chandra Das has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of a somewhat similar
ceremony in Tibet performed by some Lamas to cure him of a sickness. An
image representing the patient, and supposed to resemble him, was
constructed, and a suit of his clothes placed in front of it, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span>
with portions of his usual food and drink. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Lamas then muttered
mystic sentences, ringing a bell, waving a Dorje (see p. 323 of these
Lectures), and twisting their fingers and hands into the mysterious
shapes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mudra (p. 241). Next they broke out into alternate
exhortations and threats, and at the conclusion of the ceremony the
officiating priests supplicated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> (Yama) to accept the
image in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the moribund man.

On <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> occasion, when Mr. Sarat Chandra Das was seriously ill in
Tibet, an effective method of curing his disease was proposed to him,
and, with his consent, actually carried out. This mainly consisted in
the ransoming of fish-life. A <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Lama started off for a fisherman’s
village, and in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> returned in a high state of satisfaction.
He had saved the lives of five hundred fishes for the benefit of the
sick man. The merit of this deed was credited to the patient on his
repeating the following prayer:—

‘By virtue of my having ransomed the lives of these animals, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> health,
longevity, prosperity, and happiness perpetually accrue to me.’

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in Burma, in times of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat and drought, when the
ponds and tanks appear to be on the point of drying up, it is held to be
a <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of enormous merit to rescue fish, <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> them in jars, and transport
them alive to the rivers. (See Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii. 43.)

Similarly a bird-catcher will sell live birds to pious persons, that
they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> gain merit by releasing them.

We <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on, in the next place, to the usages and ceremonies common at
death.

If a man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is to be separated from his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> properly and
peacefully, so as not to hurt the survivors, and in a manner likely to
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> a happy re-birth for himself, alms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be bestowed on the
monk-priests, and their presence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be invited for the repetition of
prayers. In Ceylon and Burma monks go to the houses of mourners and
repeat portions of the Pirit (see p. 317).

In Tibet the priest not only recites prayers but compresses the skull
till it appears to crack, or else the hair is torn off and a little
incision is made, to enable the dying man’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to escape. The priest
then settles what method of burial is to be followed, and the place, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
and hour, all of which depend on astrological combinations, <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> only
to him.

The method of disposing of a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> differs in all Buddhist countries
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to station, condition, rank, and wealth.

In Ceylon the bodies of monks are all burnt, and the cremation
ceremonies are carried out under decorated arches or canopies, which are
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> removed, but left to crumble away.

In Burma the cremation of a monk distinguished for sanctity is an affair
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> state and ceremonial. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (see Mr. Scott’s ‘Burman,’ ii.
331) is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> embalmed, and next tightly wrapped in white cloth, which
is varnished and afterwards covered with gold-leaf. The corpse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
gilded is placed in an unclosed inner coffin, and left exposed to view
for a considerable time. When fastened down, the inner coffin is covered
with gold-leaf, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the body. An outer sarcophagus is then prepared,
and painted to represent scenes from the lives of the Buddha. This is
placed in a building erected for the purpose, and there the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> lies in
state for several months, while a constant line of pilgrim-worshippers
<span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> in and out. In process of time, when enough money for the expenses
has been collected, a grand cremation takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> under a lofty canopy,
which on special occasions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be fifty or sixty feet high. The calcined
bones are then reverentially collected, and either buried near the
temple or pounded and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up into a paste, with which an image of the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is constructed for worship in the monastery.

In Tibet the bodies of the Grand Lamas are generally embalmed and
preserved in monuments or Stupas. Other Lamas and monks distinguished
for sanctity are burnt, and their ashes are either distributed as
relics, or preserved in idols or in small Dagabas. Kings, princes, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> burnt, and of course with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> ceremony and
repetition of prayers. Then for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> afterwards prayers continue
to be recited by the priests, the object being to propitiate Yama, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
of Death, and to deliver the deceased from the possible purgatorial
torments of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the hells. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that this repetition of prayers
is prolonged, in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of the rich, for seven weeks, and in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span>
of princes, for a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> year.

Mr. J. Ware Edgar, C.S.I., in his interesting Report of his visit to
Sikkim in 1873, gives a description of the remarkable funeral ceremonies
performed on the occasion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the Raja of Sikkim’s sister
(see p. 62), which I here abbreviate:—

  The Raja’s sister had died a few <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> after his return to Choombi. The
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> had been buried at Choombi, but her clothes had been sent to
  Toomlong, and her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> was supposed to accompany them. There a
  lay-figure meant to represent her, dressed in her costume as a nun,
  and wearing a gilt mitre and a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> white veil, was placed on a kind

  afterwards the lay-figure of the nun was taken to Pemyangchi. There,

  from Choombi. On the third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> towards evening the tea-cup of the nun

  When the Lama had finished his address, some of the monks took down
  the lay-figure and undressed it, while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> formed a procession and
  conducted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the nun into the darkness outside the monastery,
  with a discordant noise of conch-shells, thigh-bone trumpets, Tibetan
  flutes, gongs, cymbals, tambourines, and drums.

In Japan small portions of the calcined remains (often not larger than
peas) are preserved in globular glass shrines, and then duly honoured
and worshipped.

The method of disposing of the dead bodies of the laity and of the
common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> is generally <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more simple. In most Buddhist countries
laymen are buried, and the priests lead the processions to the grave. In
Ceylon, the laity are certainly, as a rule, buried and not burnt.

In Burma rich laymen are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> generally buried, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Mr.
Scott, the funeral is a grand affair.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is swathed in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> white cotton cloth, leaving the face
uncovered. A piece of gold or silver is placed between the teeth to
serve as ferry-money over the Buddhist Styx—the terrible river of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span>
which all deceased persons are compelled to pass. This river is clearly
the counterpart of the Vaitara?i of the Hindus (see ‘Brahmanism and
Hinduism,’ p. 297).

If the dead man’s family is poor, a copper coin or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a betel nut will
suffice. Next the monks are sent for, their immediate presence being
necessary to keep off the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits who always swarm near a corpse.
After an interval the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is placed in a coffin, which is sometimes
gilded and placed on a bier under a canopy. When the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> arrives
for the funeral, a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> procession is formed, with a number of priests
in proportion to the amount of alms bestowed, and a crowd of relations,
friends, and neighbours. Occasionally those who carry the bier stop and
go through a sort of solemn dance, while mournful tunes are played by
the musicians and funeral dirges are sung. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is finally buried in
a cemetery to the west of the town or village. A funeral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> go
to the north or to the east. The ceremony concludes by alms to the
priests, who in return intone the commandments and other portions of the
<span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> in Pali. After the funeral, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> festivities go on in the
family-abode for the benefit of the crowds who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to offer condolence.
Then the presence of the priests is again needed, and has to be paid for
by alms to the monastery, or the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, who are sure to hang
about, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be got rid of. In some parts of Burma the cremation of
rich laymen is not uncommon, and the ashes are either deposited in
Dagabas—that is, in small Stupas or Pagodas[171]—or are pounded into
paste and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> into miniature Stupas (p. 506) or into small images of
the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> for worship at the domestic altar.

In Tibet and Mongolia the corpses of the laity, especially of the poor,
are often exposed in the fields, in deserts, or on mountain tops, or
rocks, or in lonely ravines, or sometimes in open places enclosed for
the purpose. Occasionally they are covered with a thin layer of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or
loose stones. Usually they are devoured by vultures, dogs, and other
animals.

It seems that in Lhassa <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> dogs are kept for that purpose[172]. A
class of professional <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> exist there, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> business it is to cut up
dead bodies, and throw the flesh piecemeal to dogs and vultures. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span>
the bones are sometimes pounded, and the dust, being mixed with flour,
is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to be devoured. The strange <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> is, that this kind of burial
is <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> desirable, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> honourable. To be eaten up by sacred dogs

Huc, a common funeral ceremony <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the Mongols
consists in carrying the corpse to the summit of a mountain, or to the
bottom of a ravine. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is walled up in a sort of kiln of a
pyramidal form, with a small door at the bottom, and an opening at the
top to maintain a current of air, and allow the smoke to escape. During
the combustion the Lamas recite prayers. When the corpse is consumed,
the kiln is demolished. Then the bones are collected and carried to the
Grand Lama, who reduces them to a powder, and, after adding an equal
quantity of wheaten flour, kneads the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> carefully, and, with his own
hands, fashions a number of cakes of various sizes. These are afterwards
placed in a pyramidal Stupa, which has been built beforehand in some
auspicious place.

The soil of the famous monastery of the Five Towers in the province of
Shan Si, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be so <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> that those interred there are sure to

frequently seen carrying on their shoulders the bones of their kindred,
and journeying to the Five Towers—there to purchase, almost at its
weight in gold, a little surface of ground whereon to erect a small
Stupa. Some of them undertake a toilsome journey of a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> year’s
duration, to reach this <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> spot (see p. 435).

Burial in rivers, which is highly prized by the Hindus, is not in favour
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Buddhists.

It is certainly a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> which is accepted and
employed by all Buddhists of whatever nationality.

Tsong Khapa, it is said, established at Lhassa an annual
prayer-congregation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Monlam Chenpo (see p. 386). But the most
common prayer used in Tibet is a mere formulary, the constant repetition
of which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most amazing instances of the tyranny of
superstition to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the world.

It consists of the six-syllabled sentence, Om ma?i padme Hum, ‘Om! the
Jewel in the Lotus! Hum!’

This prayer, or rather mystical sentence, is supposed to have been
composed by Padma-pa?i (Avalokite?vara), and to have reference to his
own manifestation as the Patron-Saint of Tibet[173]. It is sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Ma?i or ‘Jewel’ prayer, and, if brevity is a valuable
quality, its excellence is undeniable, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> it consists of merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
Sansk?it words, between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mystical, untranslatable auspicious
ejaculations, Om and Hum[174].

Doubtless the prayer really owes its origin to the close connexion which
sprang up between Northern Buddhism and ?aivism. The worshippers of ?iva
have always used (compare p. 240) similar mystical sentences and
syllables <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhara?is, to which a kind of miraculous efficacy is
attributed. In all probability an occult <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> underlies the
‘Jewel-lotus’ formula, and my own belief is that the majority of those
who repeat it are ignorantly doing homage to the self-generative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
supposed to inhere in the universe—a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> pointed at by the popular
Sa?khya theory of the union of Prak?iti and Purusha, and by the
universal worship of the Li?ga and Yoni throughout India[175]. No
thoughtful person can have travelled <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in India <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> being
impressed with this.

At all events, whatever be its origin and meaning, no other prayer used
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings in any quarter of the globe is repeated so often. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span>
Tibetan believes it to be a panacea for all evil, a compendium of all
knowledge, a treasury of all wisdom, a summary of all religion. But if
you ask Northern Buddhists to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you the reason for this belief, very

learned doctors of philosophy who are to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in Tibetan
monasteries, it is certainly addressed to their patron deity
Avalokite?vara, and the real secret of its efficacy lies in the fact,
that each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of its six syllables has a potent influence on some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
the six _Gatis_ or courses of being—that is to say, on some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the
six kinds of transmigration or transformation through which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> living
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> has to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> (see p. 121)[176].

The oftener, therefore, this mystical formula is repeated the shorter
will be an individual’s course (gati) through some of these six forms of
existence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of which involves misery or evil. Or it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be that
by repeating it he will be able to escape some of the six existences
altogether.

Strange <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> appear to us, it is impossible to shake the
faith of a Lamistic Buddhist in the absolutely infallible efficacy of
his six favourite mystic syllables. He repeats them, not at all as if he
were praying in a Christian sense, but as if he were a farmer intent on
planting the very best seed in the most productive soil, and watering it
incessantly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the most scientific principles of irrigation. A
bountiful harvest is absolutely <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> to reward his efforts.

It need not, therefore, surprise us if these six syllables are murmured
morning, noon, and night, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> man, woman, and child, wherever the
Lamistic Hierarchy has extended. And, if not repeated by the voice, an
incessant stream of repetition—an incessant scattering of the six mystic
seeds—is kept going by the hand.

The <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are written or printed on roll <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> roll of paper and
inscribed in cylinders, which, when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to revolve either by educated
monks or by illiterate laymen, have the same efficacy as if they were
actually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> or repeated. The revolutions are credited as so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
prayer-merit, or, to speak more scientifically, as so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
_prayer-force_, accumulated and stored up for the benefit of the person
who revolves them.

The cylinder is generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of metal, the prayer being engraved on
the outside, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as written on paper and inserted inside. It is held

handle in a particular direction (with the sun). If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to revolve the
other way, its rotations will be <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> down to the debtor rather than the
creditor side of the owner’s account. Here is a drawing of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of

Tibetan, Chos-kor or Chos-kyi or Khor-lo), obtained by me at Darjiling:—

Then, again, the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the prayer are written or printed millions and
millions of times on rolls or strips of paper, and enclosed in <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
larger barrel-like cylinders, which are <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up in temples, chapels,
monasteries, corridors, passages, houses, villages, by the road side,
and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> possible corner, for the convenience of the mass of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are too ignorant to read, and too indolent to engage in
continuous oral repetition[177].

It sometimes happens that quarrels arise from rival claims in regard to
the use of such prayer-cylinders. In illustration of this an amusing
story is told by the French missionaries:—

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> when they happened to be passing a praying-machine, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up near
a monastery, they saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Lamas engaged in a violent quarrel; and, as it
appeared, all on <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of their zeal for their prayers. The fact was
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Lama had come, and, having <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the barrel in motion for his own
benefit, was retiring modestly and complacently to his own abode, when
happening to turn his head to enjoy the spectacle of the wheel’s pious
revolutions, he saw the other Lama stop it, and <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> it whirling again
for himself. Indignant, of course, at this unwarrantable interference
with his own devotions, he ran back, and in his turn <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> a stop to his
rival’s piety, and both of them continued this kind of demonstration for
some time, till at last losing patience they proceeded to menaces, and
then to blows, when an <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Lama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> out of a neighbouring cell, and
<span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> the difficulty to a peaceful termination by himself twirling the
prayer-barrel for the benefit of both parties.

On the occasion of my visiting Darjiling in 1884, I was desirous of
judging for myself of the method of using these remarkable instruments
of religion. I therefore, soon after my arrival, walked to a Buddhist
temple near the town. There I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> several large barrel-like cylinders
<span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up close <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in a row at the entrance, so that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span>
<span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving them at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> twirl, or by a rapid sweep of
his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> them all twirling at once. Inside the
entrance-portico a shrivelled and exceptionally hideous <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> woman was
seated on the ground. In her left <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> she held a small portable
prayer-cylinder, which she kept in perpetual revolution. In her <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
<span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was a cord connected with a huge barrel-like cylinder, which with
some exertion she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to rotate on its axis by help of a crank, while
she kept muttering _Om ma?i pamme Hum_ (so she pronounced it) with
amazing rapidity. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> she completed at least sixty oral
repetitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> minute, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reckoning the infinite number of
rotatory repetitions accomplished simultaneously by her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hands. And
all this was done with an appearance of apathy and mental vacuity in her
withered face, which was so distressing and melancholy to behold, that
the spectacle will <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be effaced from my memory. In <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> the
venerable dame seemed to be sublimely unconscious that any effort of
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> or concentration of either <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> or <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> was needed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span>
prayer of any value at all.

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Tibet are quite as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> slaves to this superstition as
the women. A friend of mine when staying at Darjiling had some
conversation on serious subjects with an apparently sensible native, and
observed with surprise that all the while he was engaged in talking with

And the hold which this extraordinary superstition has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

monks in some parts of Tibet, their inventive powers being stimulated by
a burning desire to economize <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and labour in the production of

prayers are repeated in this manner by a single monk, who takes a minute
or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to wind up the complicated <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> machinery, and then hastens

feeling that the ingenious contrivance of praying by clock-work enables
them to promote the common weal by making the most of both worlds. The
story goes that, in times of special need and emergency, additional
weights are attached to the machinery, and, of course, increased cogency
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to the rotatory prayers. It is to be hoped that when European
inventions find their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> across the Himalayas, steam-power <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not be
pressed into the service of these gross superstitions.

The use of prayer-wheels of various kinds is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> common in Japan, as
described in Sir Edward Reed’s work.

But praying by machinery is not all. Beneficial results are believed to
accrue through the carving of the all-powerful six syllables on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>
conceivable object.

The traveller, as he walks along, sees the mystic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> impressed on the
stones at his feet, on rocks, doors, monuments, and trees. Indeed, rich
and zealous Buddhists maintain at their own expense, companies of Lamas
for the sole object of propagating the Ma?i-padme formula. These strange
missionaries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> occasionally be encountered, chisel and hammer in hand,
traversing field, hill, dale, and desert, their only mission being to
engrave the sacred six syllables on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> rock in their path (Huc, ii.
194).

Absolutely incalculable is the grand total of Ma?i-padmes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> placed to
the credit of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of living beings during the short space of
twenty-four hours. Yet, at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">New</span> Year’s festival in Tibet,
the chief Lama will sometimes pretend to proclaim the exact sum of
mystic syllables supposed to have been repeated during its continuance,
amounting perhaps to billions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> billions, for the consolation of all
those faithful Buddhists who, oppressed by the evils of life, are
seeking for some antidote.

But the ‘jewel-lotus’ is not the only antidote. There are other short
prayer-formularies, such as Om Vajra-pa?i-Hum (addressed to the
Bodhi-sattva Vajra-pa?i, p. 201), and other still more mystical
ejaculations (such as Om ah Hum); and magical sentences, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dharani,
and profoundly significant monosyllables, such as Ram, Pha?, H?im, H?im,
?im, ?im, H?is.

And here in connexion with the ubiquity of prayer-formularies, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
not omit to notice the _Praying-walls_, that is, the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> stone walls or
banks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> (from the ‘jewel-lotus’ prayer inscribed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them)

Mendong).

These remarkable stone-structures, peculiar to Lamism, are erected by
the side of high-roads, and in frequented thoroughfares, with the simple
object of aiding in the accumulation of prayer-merit. Some are only a
few feet long, six feet high, and from six to twelve feet broad; <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>
have been met with nearly 1000 yards long, with pyramidal Stupas[179] or
Caityas (in Tibetan Chortens) at each end. Inserted in these walls are
slabs on which the six-syllabled, and other prayer-formulas, and
sometimes images of saints, are carved and dedicated as votive
offerings. Passing travellers acquire merit by keeping them on their
left side[180], so that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> follow the letters of the inscription

In the same connexion we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> advert to _Praying-flags_ and

visited a village to which a monastery is attached, and, on approaching
the spot, was surprised to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> neighbourhood studded with
poles from which <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> flags were flying. On the tops of the poles were
curious ornaments <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> caps, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of coloured cloth with flounces. I
naturally supposed that I had arrived on a gala day, and that at least a

inquiry, however, I ascertained that there was <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> unusual about the
appearance of the village, which was merely praying, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
custom, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of its flag-staffs. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the wind, which happened
to be blowing fresh, extended the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> flags, a vast number of prayers

probably hard at <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> either in the fields or at Darjiling.

I managed to obtain facsimiles of some of the flags. On them are
inscribed various versions of the inevitable Ma?i-padme formulary,
<span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with figures of the ‘flying-horse’ (Lungta, strictly rLu?-rta,
‘wind-horse’)[182] and other symbols, such as those of the Norbu
gem[183] and of the Phurbu—which are held to be peculiarly efficacious
in warding off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits or neutralizing the diseases inflicted by
them. <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> in most cases these flags are regarded by the peasantry as
talismans or charms to protect the village from the malice of
mischievous ghosts and demons, believed to haunt the atmosphere and
swarm everywhere around.

Here are some of the mystic formularies inscribed on my flags. They
resemble ?aiva Mantras and Dhara?is—that is, mystical <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> or sentences

Sarva-siddhi-phala Hum, Om muni muni maha-muni, ?akya-muni svaha, Om

It is of course a <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit to erect prayer-flags. They <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> a
conspicuous feature in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> landscape throughout Tibet, fluttering on
hills and in valleys, by the roadside, and on the river bank, on walls
and on the tops of houses, in streets, squares, and gardens.

Then, again, the duty of a constant repetition of prayer-formulæ and
mystical sentences has led Northern Buddhists to employ _Rosaries_,
which were used both by Hindus and Buddhists <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into
vogue in Europe. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> these necessary aids to devotion the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
rounds of repetition <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be accurately completed. In Northern
Buddhist countries rosaries ought to consist of 108 beads, which in
Tibet are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to represent the 108[185] volumes of the Kanjur. The same
number of beads is used by the worshippers of Vish?u, who use the rosary
to aid them in repeating any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the names of Vish?u 800 times, the
eight additional beads marking each century of repetitions.

The commonest Buddhist rosaries are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of wood, or pebbles, or
berries, or bone[186]; the more costly, of turquoise, coral, amber, or
silver, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> of pearls and gems. If a rosary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the bones of
some <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Lama can be procured, it is of course prized above all others.
Sometimes a Dorje is appended. Northern Buddhist worshippers hold their
rosaries (like Roman Catholics) in the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> hand, and move on the beads
with the left, and they will do this while talking <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
quarrelling. In China and Japan Buddhist rosaries are often arranged in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rings. They sometimes consist of enormous beads with relics in the
central bead.

Be it observed, however, that the prayer-formularies of Buddhists are
not always a mere unintelligible string of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> and syllables,
muttered, iterated, and reiterated with the aid of rosaries. Their
prayers sometimes contain lofty sentiments. For instance, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
vagabond mendicant monks seen by me at Darjiling (described at p. 267)
<span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> about chanting the following:—

  Reverence to all the noble Father-Lamas! I address this to the feet of
  Duang our patron saint. I, Milaraspa[187], sing it. If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> be
  white (enlightened), it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be white inside and outside. I am born in
  consequence of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> of this world. My earthly <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is a sower
  of the seed of sin. My mother is the soil which receives the seed of
  sin. The child is myself tied to the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> by the cord of sin. When
  you think of your earthly father, think <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of your Lama (spiritual
  father). Your earthly <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> is the source of your sin. Your Lama
  frees you from sin[188].

But this song, which was repeated over and over again, invariably
concluded by a repetition of the inevitable six-syllabled formula. This
they repeated very rapidly, pronouncing it as usual, ‘Om ma?i-pamme
Hum,’ and adding the mystical syllable H?is. Their chanting was
accompanied by an incessant agitation of their ?amaru or sacred drum,
which I was able to purchase. It is shaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hemispheres, joined
on their convex sides, and is encircled by sacred shells. It is sounded
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of buttons attached to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pendulous strips of leather. The

Again, Dr. Eitel (Lectures, iii.) mentions a manual of daily prayer used
by Northern Buddhists, which shows that striking <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are sometimes

those who repeat them. For instance, the following:—

‘May all the Buddhas abide in me, instruct and enlighten me with

Before, therefore, concluding this Lecture we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> acknowledge, in
fairness to the inhabitants of Tibet, that <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
religion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be mingled with their superstitions.

prayers are not merely repeated by machinery, written on paper, and
inscribed on rocks and stones. The voices of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, if not their
thoughts, often go heartily with uttered prayers. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> of prayer is
raised at all times and seasons—in the morning, mid-day, and evening, in
private and in public, at home or abroad, in the midst of labour and
idleness, in lying down and rising up, in moving about and keeping
still, on the march and on the battle-field, on mournful occasions, and
in the midst of joy and laughter. Nor is any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> ashamed of praying
aloud or praying <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in the open streets and squares of crowded
towns.

‘There exists,’ <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> the French Missionary (ii. 194), ‘a very touching
custom at Lhassa. In the evening, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is verging on its

prayers.

‘The religious concerts produced by these numerous assemblages create
throughout the town a solemn harmony, which operates forcibly on the
soul.

                              LECTURE XIV.
                            _Sacred Places._


It was only to be expected, that Buddhism, closely connected as it was
with Brahmanism and Hinduism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in some respects opposed to those
systems, should have <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sacred places and hallowed regions, some of
which were identical with those of Brahmanism and Hinduism, and some
peculiarly its own.

In the Maha-parinibbana-sutta (V. 16-22, Rhys Davids), we have the
following declaration:—

  ‘There are four places which the believing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> should visit as a
  pilgrim with feelings of reverence and awe. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can
  say, “Here the Tathagata (one of the names of Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 23) was
  born.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can say, “Here the Tathagata attained to
  perfect insight and enlightenment.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which he can say,
  “Here the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> preached by the Tathagata.” The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at which
  he can say, “Here the Tathagata passed finally <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in that utter
  passing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> which leaves <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> whatever behind” (see p. 142, note,
  and p. 477).

  ‘And they who die, while with believing <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> they journey on such
  pilgrimages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be reborn, in the happy realms of heaven.’

The Chinese traveller, Fa-hien, names the same four sacred places (Chap.
xxxi.), and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that the situation of the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Stupas (see p.
504) has been fixed, namely, (1) where the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was born, (2) where he
attained wisdom, (3) where he began to turn the wheel of his Law, (4)

the scene of the Buddha’s itineration for forty-five years—a region
about 300 miles long, by nearly 200 broad, lying in Gangetic India,

                            _Kapila-vastu._

Kapila-vastu (in Pali, Kapila-vatthu) was <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> searched for by
archæologists in vain, but is now identified by General Sir A.
Cunningham and Mr. Carlleyle with Bhuila, a village surrounded by buried
brickwork in the Basti district under the Nepal mountains, about
twenty-five miles north-east from Faizabad, twelve north-west from
Basti, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hundred and twenty north of Benares. Both Fa-hien (Legge,
67) and Hiouen Thsang describe the neighbouring Lumbini (Lava?i) garden,
where the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was born from the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side of his mother (see p. 23,
and engraving opposite p. 477). They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> mention the Arrow-fountain
where Gautama contended with <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> of his tribe in a shooting-match.
The legend is (p. 24) that he gained the victory by shooting an arrow
which passed through the target, buried itself in the ground, and caused
a clear spring of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> to flow <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> (Legge, 65-67; Beal, ii. 23, 24).
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> ?ara-Kupa, ‘arrow-fountain,’ has now been corrupted into
Sar-Kuia (or Sar-Kuhiya), and the spot has been identified (Cunningham’s
‘Reports of Survey,’ xii. 188).

It <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have been expected that so sacred a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> as Kapila-vastu—the
birth-place of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the scene of his education and youthful
exploits—would have been a favourite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage for Buddhists
through all time; but we learn from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chinese travellers, that

neighbourhood was a desert and the town in ruins (Beal, i. 50; ii. 14).
The reason probably is that Hinduism gained the ascendancy over Buddhism
in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> localities, and that when this happened the Brahmans took
pains to obliterate all traces of the rival creed. In later times
Muhammadan invasions contributed to the same result.


                             _Buddha-Gaya._

This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> obtained perfect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
enlightenment after his sexennial course of fasting and meditation (see
p. 31 of this volume). It is situated six or seven miles from the town
of Gaya, and about sixty miles from Patna and Bankipur. It is of all
Buddhist sacred places the most sacred, and abounds in profoundly
interesting memorials of early Buddhism.

Of course it was only to be expected that memorial structures intended
to mark important epochs in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the extinct Buddha, and
calculated to foster feelings of reverence in the minds of his
followers, should have been erected at this and various other <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> spots
of ground consecrated by the presence and acts of Gautama on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
occasions. And of all such Buddhist monuments the ancient pyramidal
temple at Buddha-Gaya, which I visited in 1876 and 1884, is the most
striking and full of interest. Probably a monument of some kind was
erected there not very <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> after the Buddha’s death, and Hiouen Thsang
(see p. 399) mentions the temple built there by A?oka. The temple which
I saw on the occasion of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> visit was probably not built till the
middle of the second century, but was erected on the foundation of
A?oka’s temple, the ruins of which are traceable under the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span>
one[190]. The materials consist of bluish bricks, plastered with lime.
Hiouen Thsang states that in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it had eleven stories and an
altitude of about 165 feet. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> had niches in each story, with a
golden statue of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in each niche. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> was crowned with the
representation of an Amalaka fruit (Emblic myrobalan) in gilt copper
(Cunningham’s Report, i. 5). The Burmese probably restored the temple
between 1035 and 1078 A.D. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Though</span> falling into decay in 1876, its
appearance struck me as exceedingly imposing,—even more so than that of
the grand pyramidal towers, built over the entrances to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> South
Indian temples[191]. The annexed engraving of this ancient monument as
it appeared in 1880, before its restoration, is from a photograph by Mr.
Beglar, taken on the spot, and enlarged by Mr. Austen.

[Illustration: ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAYA, AS IT APPEARED IN
1880.]

Erected about the middle of the second century over the ruins of A?oka’s
         temple, at the spot where Gautama attained Buddhahood.

The original object of its erection seems to have been simply and solely
to serve as a monument, and not as a Dagaba or receptacle for relics.
Very soon, however, monuments of this kind were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to enshrine images,
and were used as temples and places of worship. On inquiry I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that
the ancient image or images of Buddha, which once occupied the shrine in
the ancient Buddha-Gaya temple, had been destroyed or carried off at
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> times[192], and that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> stone image, believed to have
been carved in the eighth century, had been recently substituted for it.
It is remarkable that during the process of restoring the so-called
‘diamond throne,’ on which the statues were placed, a mass of fragments
of coral, sapphire, cornelian, crystal, ruby, pearl, ivory, and gold,
but no diamond, was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> compacted or cemented <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in front of
it[193].

At the back of the raised terrace which surrounded the ancient temple
was a Pipal or sacred fig-tree, fabled to be the very tree under which
Gautama sat during his course of profound meditation ending in
Buddhahood (see p. 31). Its vitality was on the wane, for its decaying
branches drooped over the parapet as if they sought, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> those of a
neighbouring Banyan tree, to gain <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by rooting themselves in the
ground beneath. Some Buddhist pilgrims happened, at the moment of my
visit, to be worshipping at the temple, deputed by the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Burma to
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> offerings. I observed that they had <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> packets of
gold-leaf, and had gilded the stone steps that surrounded the tree.
Having performed this act of homage, they sat near muttering their
prayer-formularies. No doubt they believed it to be the very Bodhi-tree
of Gautama’s time, the stem of which had been miraculously preserved,
though, had it been really so, the stem <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been about
twenty-three centuries old. Considering the well-known properties of the
Pipal tree, it is possible that the worshippers were, after all, paying
honour to the descendant of the original tree, the fact, no doubt, being
that as each tree began to decay a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was produced, by the dropping
of seeds into the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> roots and the springing up of fresh scions.
Probably most of the sacred trees in the neighbourhood of Buddhist
temples throughout India, Ceylon, and Burma were originally raised from
seeds <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from the ancient Buddha-Gaya tree.

[Illustration: ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLE AT BUDDHA-GAYA, AS RESTORED IN
1884.]

It is a received tradition that a shoot from this tree was taken by the
Missionary Mahendra, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of A?oka, in the third century B.C. to Ceylon,
and planted at Anuradha-pura, where its descendant still flourishes.

When I again visited Buddha-Gaya in 1884, I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> pyramidal
temple had been restored <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> (as is conjectured) to Hiouen
Thsang’s description of the Vihara of his day.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the late Burmese government, not very <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> ago, spent
about thirty thousand rupees in building a wall round the temple and
making excavations with a view to its restoration. Then our government,
about 1881 or 1882, undertook the work, and I believe at least a lakh of
rupees has been spent in completing it. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a representation of the
restored temple (as it appeared in 1884), from a photograph taken by Mr.
Beglar, and enlarged by Mr. Austen. Its <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> height is 176 feet, as
it has several tiers of the usual umbrella-like ornament, tapering to a
point at the summit[194].

The reconstruction of the temple led of course to the removal of the
sacred Bodhi-tree, but an effort was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to preserve the tree by
transplanting it to a neighbouring garden. No sooner was this done than
parties of pilgrims from Burma and Ceylon, in their pious desire to
maintain the vitality of the venerated tree, covered the stem with
gold-leaf, and, bringing Eau de Cologne and other scents, poured them
over the roots, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> manuring them with the contents of
boxes of sardines steeped in oil, choice biscuits, and other delicacies.
Of course, the result was the speedy destruction of the tree, root and
branch. To compensate for its loss, a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> Pipal tree was planted behind
the restored temple by Sir A. Cunningham in 1885. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> near the
temple appeared to be in a flourishing condition in 1884, and I observed
that both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims met <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> there as worshippers
of the same sacred object.

The idol-shrine, under the principal tower of the restored temple,
consists of a small vaulted stone-chamber lighted only by the door. My
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> act, on arriving at Gaya in 1884, was to descend to this
interesting spot. At the further <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> is the principal statue of Buddha,
seated, in the ‘witness-attitude’ (see p. 480)—on an altar-like throne
having five pilasters, and supposed to represent the original
Bodhi-ma??a. The pedestal of the statue is ornamented with
diamond-shaped carvings, and sculptures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elephants and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
lions[195].

Inside the shrine, at the moment of my visit, were five Burmese pilgrims
from Mandelay. They were apparently monks, as all were habited in yellow
dresses. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> bowed down before the image, with hands joined in
reverence, occasionally touching the ground with his forehead, and going
through a course of prayer-repetition by help of a rosary. After
worshipping for some time, they deposited a quantity of offerings, of a
somewhat miscellaneous description, in front of the image. I noticed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> other things, rice, fruit, vegetables, flowers of the Bel-tree,
tin boxes filled with sardines, Huntley and Palmer’s biscuits, bottles
of the genuine Maria Farina’s Eau de Cologne for watering the
sacred-trees, and a large number of packets of gold-leaf. I left the
shrine for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hours, and on returning <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that the pilgrims
had crowned their act of worship by gilding the image with the contents
of these packets, reserving a supply for covering the other images in

considerable.

At the back of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Buddha-Gaya temple, I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a stone tablet for
offerings, recently <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and fixed horizontally in the ground by
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> pilgrim who was from Colombo in Ceylon. It bore an inscription
indicating that the slab had been placed there as a votive offering by a
person calling himself Gu?a-ratna Muddali Raja of Kolamba-pur. The date
carved on it (Buddha-vasse 2427) shows that the Buddhists of Ceylon are
no believers in the researches of modern scholars. They still reckon
from B.C. 543 for the supposed Nirva?a of Buddha.

At a little distance in front of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Temple, but on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>

In the
latter is a circular stone with nine circles of complicated ornaments.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Vajrasana, from the thunderbolt ornament in the second

I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> mention here that a portion of the original A?oka stone-railing,
with an inscription, lotus-ornaments and carvings, was discovered in a
fair state of preservation by Sir A. Cunningham, and is now to be seen
_in situ_. The Buddha’s walking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was unearthed by Mr. Beglar. The
massive <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> brick railing which now encloses the temple has been <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
constructed after an ancient pattern, and ornamented with numerous
carvings representing scenes in the lives of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 111). The

<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> appearance of the square and the sacred area of ground
adjoining—strewn with ruins of the Stupas erected by A?oka and
others—and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the legend by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Indra and Brahma—is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of the most striking sights in all India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be seen to be
appreciated.

In truth, Buddha-Gaya is a kind of Buddhist Jerusalem, abounding in
associations of thrilling interest, not only to the followers of Buddha,
but to all who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> in that spot the central focus whence radiated a
system which for centuries has permeated the religious <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of the
most populous regions of Eastern Asia, and influenced the creed of a
majority of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> race.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> remarkable characteristic of this spot is that it was converted
into a kind of Buddhist Necropolis, teeming with the remains of
generations of the Buddha’s adherents contained in relic-receptacles
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Stupas (pp. 503-506), some of which have been <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to light,
while countless <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> still remain to be unearthed.

The fact was that immense numbers of pilgrims from all parts of India
and the outlying countries once thronged in crowds to Buddha-Gaya, and
nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> pilgrim <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with him a Stupa or relic-shrine of some
kind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to his means, and deposited it as a votive offering in
this hallowed region, either with the object of acquiring religious
merit for himself, or of promoting the welfare of the deceased in other
states of being. Often it was inscribed with the usual Buddhist formula,
Ye Dharma, etc. (see p. 104), and sometimes bore a date and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of
the reigning king. Generally the votive Stupa contained the relics of
deceased relatives—perhaps the ashes of a <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> or mother, or pieces of
bone, or a small fragment of a single bone placed in an earthen vessel
or casket of some other material, and buried in the interior of the
Stupa.

Relics, however, were not always forthcoming, and so the votive Stupas
were frequently mere cenotaphs or models in clay or stone of actual
Stupas erected in other places. Often they were beautifully carved and
ornamented with rows on rows of images of the Buddha. I obtained some
beautiful specimens for the Indian Institute at Oxford, a drawing of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of which will be <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> (see p. 505). Layers on layers of these have been
exhumed during the process of the excavations. They are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> variety
of size, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> inches to several feet high, and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> variety of
material, from terra cotta and clay turned on a potter’s wheel to
elaborately sculptured brick and stone. All the upper layers are now
gone (those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of clay and pottery having naturally crumbled to
pieces), but the lowest are still _in situ_, and furnish specimens of
all ages from the second century to the tenth or twelfth. I noticed
hundreds lying about on the ground in 1884.

A sacred tank, mentioned by Hiouen Thsang, is situated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four
hundred yards to the left of the Buddha-Gaya temple. I found, on
visiting it, that this hallowed pool is quite as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> venerated by
Hindus as by pilgrims from Buddhist countries.

Indeed, I was <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> struck by the evidence which Buddha-Gaya affords of
the inter-relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism—especially that
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vaish?avism. For instance, on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side of the
temple I noticed the tombs of the Mahants, or Heads of the neighbouring
Hindu monastery, who are buried there in a sitting posture. Near these
again are shrines of the five Pa??ava heroes (who <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the
five Buddhas), and a shrine containing the supposed impression of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet of Vish?u. The upper portion of a small Buddhist Stupa has been
sawn off and inverted[196], and Vish?u’s footsteps carved on the smooth
surface. This certainly symbolizes in a remarkable manner the merging of
Buddhism in Vaish?avism, and bears out Dr. Sachau’s assertion that in
Alberuni’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> Vish?u-worship was dominant in India.

Then, again, on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> of the entrance to the principal temple is a
raised platform of earth, on which are images of Vish?u, ?iva, Parvati,
and Ga?e?a. Here I saw a ?raddha ceremony[197], in the act of being
performed by some Hindus—just arrived from the neighbouring town of
Gaya. They were repeating their mantras, offering their Pi??as, and
putting the finishing stroke to the funeral services (previously
performed by them at the Vish?u-pad temple at Gaya), under the shadow of
a Pipal tree, held as sacred by them as by Buddhists.

To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an exhaustive <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the objects crowded <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> at this

  In <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> days, when <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was alive, the Bodhi-tree—which is a Pippala

  To the east of the Bodhi-tree, there is a Vihara about 160 or 170 feet
  high, built of blue tiles covered with chunam; all the niches in the
  <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> stories holding golden figures. The four sides of the
  building are covered with ornamental work. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> is surmounted by
  a gilded copper Amalaka fruit. To the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and left of the gate are
  niches; in the left is a figure of Avalokite?vara Bodhi-sattva and in
  the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> a figure of Maitreya. On the site of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Vihara,

  a convert to Buddhism, reconstructed it on a larger scale.

  To the north of the Bodhi-tree is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> walked up and

  tempted Gautama to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Universal Monarch. To the north-west is a
  Vihara in which is an image of Ka?yapa Buddha, noted for its
  miraculous qualities. Occasionally it emits a glorious light, and the
  <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> records say, that if a man, actuated by sincere faith, walks round
  it seven times, he obtains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of knowing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and
  condition of his previous births. Outside the south gate is a large
  tank, about 700 paces round, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> of which is clear and pure as a
  mirror. To the east of this is the lake of the Snake-king, Mucalinda.
  On the west bank is a small Vihara. Formerly, when Tathagata acquired
  complete enlightenment, he sat here for seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> in perfect
  composure, and ecstatic contemplation, while Mucalinda protected him
  with his folds wound seven times round his body. (Compare the
  frontispiece.)

  By the side of the river, not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> off, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  received the rice-milk, and where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> merchants offered some
  wheat-flour and honey from their travelling-store (p. 40 of this
  volume).

  Near this a Stupa marks the spot where the four Kings presented <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  with four golden dishes. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> declined such costly offerings. Then
  the four Kings, casting <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the golden vessels, offered silver ones;
  and afterwards vessels of crystal, lapis-lazuli, cornelian, amber,
  ruby, and so on in succession; but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> accept
  none of them. Lastly, the four Kings offered stone vessels.

  Near this spot the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> worked various wonders to convert those who
  were capable of conversion. For example, it was here that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
  overcame the fiery snake-demon (see p. 46 of this volume). In the
  middle of the night the Naga vomited <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and smoke, and the
  chamber seemed to be filled with fiery flames; but the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> having
  forced the fiery dragon into his alms-bowl, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
  holding it in his hand, and showed it to the unbelievers.

  To the south of Mucalinda’s tank is a Stupa, which indicates the spot
  where Ka?yapa, having embarked in a boat to save <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> during an
  inundation, saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">World</span> walking on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> as on land.


                        _Sarnath near Benares._

The <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Benares (Banaras, properly Vara?asi) is the most sacred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Brahmanism[198], and is certainly the second most <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of
Buddhism. For it was from this centre that the stream of Buddhist
teaching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> flowed, and in the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of A?oka and of his immediate
successors, Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have vied with Brahmanism in the number of its
shrines and sacred objects collected there.

We have already seen that memorial Stupas and temples, not intended to
contain relics, were reared at various <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> spots of ground, consecrated
by the presence of Gautama on special occasions. The immense ruined
Stupa—once a tower-like monument—at a spot now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sarnath
(Sara?ga-nath[199]), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four miles from the modern <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of
Benares, is a memorial of this kind. It is all that remains of the
celebrated structure erected at the spot in the M?iga-dava or deer-park,
once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Isi-patana (for Sansk?it ?ishi-patana), where Gautama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
turned the wheel of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (Dharma-cakra)—that is, where he preached
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sermon (p. 42). It was to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> that Buddhist pilgrims
once flocked, and here vast numbers of votive relic-shrines and Stupas
were deposited, as at Buddha-Gaya.

I visited this ancient ruin, in company with the late Mr. Sherring, in
1876, and enjoyed the advantage of his guidance in inspecting it, as
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as all that remains of the monastic buildings and other adjacent
ruins, including the octagonal tower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Chaukandi, about half a mile
distant. In his <span class="t24 hoverable">book</span> on Benares, Mr. Sherring has followed General Sir
A. Cunningham, who describes the principal monument—now of a bee-hive
shape, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Dhamek[200]—as 93 feet in diameter at the base, 292
feet in circumference, and 128 feet above the general level of the soil.
The lower part—to a height of 43 feet—is built of stone, and all the
upper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of bricks. There are eight projecting faces with empty
niches, which once held statues.

An <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who was in charge of the ruins when we examined them, lighted
a candle, and took us into the horizontal tunnel-like gallery which the
General had excavated some <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before, in the hope that relics or
memorials of some kind <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> buried in the interior. A shaft or
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> had been previously sunk from the summit, and at the depth of 10½
feet a slab was discovered, inscribed with the well-known Buddhist
formula ‘Ye dharma,’ etc. (p. 104); but the search for relics proved
unsuccessful. The Stupa, in fact, turned out to be merely memorial, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
that at Buddha-Gaya.

Probably some monumental Stupa existed here from the earliest times, and
certainly from A?oka’s time. The <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Stupa was seen by Hiouen
Thsang, who has described it in rather a confused manner (Beal, ii. 45).
Hence it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be as <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as about the ninth century. Fa-hien saw a Stupa
of some kind there in the fifth century (p. 387).

About fifty yards from the Stupa, Sir A. Cunningham <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the
interesting sculpture <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> at p. 477.


                             _Raja-g?iha._

Raja-g?iha (Pali, Raja-gaha) is the modern Raj-gir. The <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> had the
epithet Giri-vraja, ‘surrounded by hills[201].’ It was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
metropolis or mother-city of Buddhism, and the original capital of the
powerful kingdom of Magadha, when under the rule of the Kings Bimbi-sara
(p. 48) and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Ajata-?atru, who were contemporaries and friends of
Gautama, and converted by him to Buddhism[202]. The sacred character of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is attested by the ruins of vast numbers of Buddhist Stupas
and Viharas which once existed here. Unhappily Brahmans and Musalmans
have used the materials for their temples, tombs, and mosques.

It was here that Gautama <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> studied under the Brahmans A?ara and
Uddaka (p. 29), and here he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> imbibed the philosophical ideas which
afterwards coloured his teaching. It is not surprising, therefore, that
at a later period of his career he was fond of returning to Raja-g?iha
for retirement during Vassa; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> favourite resorts[203] being the
Bambu grove (Ve?u-vana, p. 48) and the hill <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vulture-peak
(G?idhra-ku?a, Legge’s Fa-hien, 81, 83), both in the neighbourhood of
the city.

It was here, too, that several interesting incidents in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> occurred. For example, it was here in a cavern that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
often meditated. It was here that he often preached and taught; and it
was here, or in the neighbourhood of the city, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?akra
(Indra) once appeared to Buddha, bringing a musician from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> to
entertain him, and afterwards testing his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by forty-two
questions. These the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> traced with his finger on the rock, and the

time, and a monastery was built on the spot. With reference to this
legend we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> that the answers to the forty-two questions are
supposed to be contained in a celebrated Tibetan <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
‘Forty-two points on which the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> gave instruction[204]’, the
importance of which is proved by its being translated into several
languages.

It was in this neighbourhood, too, that Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> chief
disciples—?ariputra and Maudgalyayana (Pali, Moggallana, p. 47)—had
their noted meeting with A?vajit (Pali, Assaji), already mentioned (p.
104). Here, also, a Jaina ascetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a pit of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and poisoned the
rice, and then invited <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> to eat. Lastly, it was here that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of

on. The story of these is so interesting that I abridge it from the
Sacred Books of the East (vol. xx. p. 238):—

  Now at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> was seated preaching the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and
  surrounded by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> multitude, including the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and his retinue.
  And Deva-datta rose from his seat, and said, ‘The Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> is now

  Sa?gha to me, I will be its leader.’ Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Buddha, ‘I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

  less then to so evil-living a person as you.’

  Then Deva-datta thought: ‘The Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> denies me before the king,
  and calls me “evil-living,” and exalts Sariputta and Moggallana.’ With
  these thoughts in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> he departed, angry and displeased, and <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
  to Ajata-sattu and said, ‘Do you, prince, kill your father, and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
  Raja; and I will kill the Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> the Buddha.’ And
  prince Ajata-sattu, taking a dagger, entered his royal father’s
  chamber. And the Raja Bimbi-sara said, ‘Why do you want to kill me, O
  prince? if you want the kingdom, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> it be thine.’ And he handed it
  over to Ajata-sattu. Then Deva-datta said, ‘Give orders, O king, to
  your men, that I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> deprive the Samana Gotama of life.’ And
  Ajata-sattu did so. Then sixteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> were sent to kill Gotama. They
  went, and returned and said, ‘We <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> kill him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
  of the Venerable One.’

  Next Deva-datta climbed up the Vulture’s Peak, and hurled down a
  mighty rock on the Venerable One. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mountain peaks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span>
  and stopped that rock. [Fa-hien <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that it hurt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his toes.

  named Nalagiri, fierce and a man-slayer. And Deva-datta caused the
  elephant to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> loose against Gotama. But the Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> infused
  a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> into the elephant. And the elephant extended his trunk
  and took up the dust from off the feet of the Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> and
  sprinkled it over his own head, and retired bowing backwards, gazing

authorities:—

  The impious Deva-datta, a cousin and brother-in-law of the Buddha,
  suffers terrible punishment in Hell. His feet are sunk ankle-deep in
  burning marl. His head is incased with a red hot metal cap down to the
  lobe of the ears. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> large red-hot bars transfix him from back to

  head to foot. (Shway Yoe’s ‘Burman,’ i. 121.)

It should be mentioned in connexion with Raja-g?iha that Ajata-?atru
built a grand Stupa there, over a portion of the Buddha’s ashes, soon
after his cremation.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> fact which enhances the interest of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> is the

                              _?ravasti._

?ravasti (Pali, Savatthi), sometimes spelt ?ravasti, has been identified
by General Cunningham with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sahet-Mahet, about
fifty-eight miles north of Ajudhya in Oudh. The town is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to derive
its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> from the fact that it was built by a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> ?ravasta.
Other native authorities derive it from a ?ishi named Savattha, who is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have resided there. It was certainly the ancient capital of
Kosala (Oudh), and was ruled over by <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Prasena-jit (Pali, Pasenadi),
who was Gautama’s contemporary. Moreover, it was the Buddha’s favourite
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of retreat[205] during the rainy seasons (p. 48 of this volume),
about half of his Vassas having been spent there[206] in the Jeta-vana
monastery built for him by the wealthy merchant Anatha-pi??ika
(Anepidu), sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Su-datta.

Doubtless on this <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> ?ravasti was once <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> resorted to by the
Buddha’s followers, and ultimately became an important seat of Buddhist
learning.

The celebrated monastery, the ruins of which still exist, was erected in
the garden (vana) of Prince Jeta, who parted with the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> to Su-datta
on condition that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> cover it with gold coins. This was done, till
eighteen krores of coins had been spread out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a pavement on the
ground. Both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang mention this incident, and the
former states that the monastery was seven stories high[207]. The
pavement of coins is represented in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the sculptures belonging to
the Stupa of Bharhut (Cunningham, pp. 84-87), as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the
pillars of A?oka’s railing at Buddha-Gaya.

?ravasti was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Fa-hien, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
sandal-wood image of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up in a monastery by <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span>
Prasena-jit (see p. 471)[208]. A colossal erect figure of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was
<span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> here in a temple excavated by Sir A. Cunningham, but this was of
stone.

With regard to the celebrated sandal-wood image, Fa-hien (p. 57) relates
a strange legend of its preservation by a miracle:—

  ‘The kings and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the countries around vied with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> in
  their offerings (to the image). Hanging up about it silken canopies,
  scattering flowers, burning incense, and lighting lamps. It happened
  that a rat, carrying in its mouth the wick of a lamp, <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the
  canopies on fire, which caught the Vihara, and the seven stories were
  all consumed. The kings and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were all very sad, supposing that
  the sandal-wood image had been burned; but lo! when a small Vihara to
  the east was opened, there was seen the original image!’

Fa-hien goes on to describe <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> miracle:—

  ‘To the north-west of the Vihara there is a grove <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> “The getting
  of Eyes.” Formerly there were five hundred blind men, who lived here;
  <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached his <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> to them, and they all got back their eyesight.
  Full of joy they stuck their staves in the earth, and did reverence.
  The staves immediately began to grow, and formed a grove’ (Legge, pp.
  58, 59).

Hiouen Thsang states that in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the towns and monasteries about
?ravasti were mostly in ruins. He, too, gives an interesting <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of
a miraculous incident which occurred there:—

  To the north-east of the Jeta-vana garden is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the

                               _Vai?ali._

Vai?ali (in Pali Vesali, now Besarh) lies twenty miles north of
Haji-pur, on the left bank of the Ganges, and twenty-seven north-east of
Patna. This town (the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of the Licchavis) is celebrated as the scene
of the second Council (p. 57). Near it, at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Bakhra, is a
celebrated ancient pillar surmounted by a lion (see Cunningham, i. 59).
Vai?ali, however, is chiefly noted as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the places where Gautama
often preached and taught, and where he stopped on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Kusinara,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of his death. His usual residence was in a Vihara, described
by Fa-hien as double-galleried, and in a garden presented to him by the
courtesan Amba-pali, whom he converted and induced to live a virtuous
life. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> resided for the fifth year of his teaching in a building
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Ku?agara[209] hall.

Hiouen Thsang speaks of the town and of the objects of interest round it
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> (Beal, ii. 66-75):—

  Both heretics and believers are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> here living together. There are
  several hundred monasteries (Sa?gharamas) which are mostly
  dilapidated. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> several Deva temples, occupied by
  sectaries of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> kinds. The followers of the Nirgranthas (i. e.
  of the Jains) are very numerous.

  To the north is a Stupa which indicates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where Tathagata
  stopped and took leave of the Licchavis, on his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to Ku?i-nagara to
  die. Wishing him to quit the world, Mara (compare p. 41) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to
  <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and said, ‘You have now dwelt sufficiently <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> in the world.
  Those whom you have saved from the circling streams of transmigration
  are as numerous as the sand.’ The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> replied, ‘No, those who are
  saved are as the grains of dust on my nail; those who are not saved
  are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the grains of dust on the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> earth. Nevertheless, after
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> die.’ Mara hearing this was rejoiced, and
  departed.

  Both <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Vai?ali and all round it, the
  sacred vestiges are so numerous, that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be difficult to recount
  them all. To the north-west is a Stupa at the spot where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> dwelt
  when he recited the history of his former birth (Jataka) as a
  Cakra-vartin or Universal Monarch (compare p. 423) possessed of the
  seven treasures. To the south-east is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Stupa, marking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
  where the convocation of the seven hundred sages and saints was held,
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hundred and ten <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after the Nirva?a of Buddha, to compel the
  monks who had broken the laws of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> to obey them.

It appears that the Licchavis of Vai?ali obtained a large quantity of
the relics of the Buddha’s body, and built a Stupa over them.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Fa-hien they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> erected a Stupa over half the relics of
the burnt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Ananda (see p. 47 of this volume), the other being
deposited near Raja-g?iha. His narrative runs as follows:—

  When Ananda was going from Magadha to Vai?ali, wishing his
  Pari-nirva?a to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Ajata-?atru heard of his
  intention, and <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out with his retinue to follow him.

  The Licchavis, too, when they heard that Ananda was coming to their
  city, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> out to meet him.

  at the river, and Ananda, thinking to himself that he ought to please
  both, burnt his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in the middle of the river, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attained
  Pari-nirva?a in a fiery ecstasy of Samadhi. Then his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was divided
  into two, so that each got <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> half as a sacred relic (Legge, pp.
  75-77).


                              _Kau?ambi._

Kau?ambi (in Pali Kosambi), now Kosam[210], on the river Jumna, about
thirty miles from Allahabad, was once a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> hallowed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
Brahmanical associations, and is mentioned in the Ramaya?a. It was the
capital of the Kau?amba country, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been founded by
Ku?amba, tenth in descent from Pururavas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> doubt it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
the most ancient cities of India.

Kali-dasa, in his ‘Cloud-Messenger[211].’ Furthermore, Kau?ambi is the
<span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> in which the scene of the Sansk?it drama Ratnavali was laid[212].

The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> resided there in the sixth and ninth <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of his Buddhahood,
and probably visited the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> at other times. This was the chief <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span>
of its reputation in connexion with Buddhism. But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> derived its
sacred character from the fact that it contained the celebrated
sandal-wood image[213] of the Buddha, believed to have been carved
during his life-time, by a sculptor sent by Moggallana (see last line,
p. 414) at <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Udayana’s request, to the Trayastri??a heaven, when the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was there preaching the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> to his mother (see p. 207).

In a village near at <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> Sir A.

had explained the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> (Legge, p. 96). Hiouen Thsang mentions that a
lofty Stupa, 200 feet high, was erected by A?oka near at hand.

There was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a cavern in which the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had left his shadow

                               _Nalanda._

Nalanda[214] was the greatest seat of Buddhist learning in India. It has
been identified by Sir A. Cunningham with the village of Baragaon, about
seven miles north of Raja-g?iha, about thirty miles south-east of the
modern Patna, and about forty miles from Buddha-Gaya. Sir Alexander
states that Baragaon possesses immense ruins and more numerous specimens
of sculpture than any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> visited by him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Hiouen
Thsang, the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> there for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months. The vast
extent and importance of the monastery (Sa?gharama) or monasteries at
Nalanda have been already alluded to (p. 169). Fa-hien, however, does
not mention them, which seems to indicate that they were built
subsequently to A.D. 425. Hiouen Thsang, who travelled in the seventh
century, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have resided there for five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> as a student. Ten
thousand monks, renowned for their learning, lived and studied in six
magnificent buildings. The following is an extract from the later
Chinese traveller’s description of it (Beal, ii. 70):—

  The monks of Nalanda, to the number of several thousands, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of
  the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> ability. Their conduct is pure and unblamable, although
  the rules of the monastery are severe. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is not sufficient for
  asking and answering profound questions. From morning till night the
  monks engage in discussion; the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> and the young mutually helping <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

  little esteemed, and are obliged to hide themselves for shame. Hence
  learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> cities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> here in multitudes to settle
  their doubts; and thence the streams of their wisdom spread <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> and
  wide. For this reason some persons usurp the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Nalanda students,
  and in going to and fro receive honour in consequence.

  If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> from other quarters desire to enter and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in the

  students who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> as strangers, have to show their ability by hard
  discussion; those who fail compared with those who succeed are as
  seven or eight to ten.


                              _Sa?ka?ya._

Sa?ka?ya, now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Sa?kisa, about fifty miles north-west of Kanouj,
was identified by Sir A. Cunningham in 1842. It was evidently once a
large town with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> remarkable monuments, and ought to be reckoned
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the most sacred places of Buddhism. Hiouen Thsang describes it
under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Kie-pi-tha (Kapitha).

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the Buddha’s mother died seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> after his birth (see
p. 24 of this volume), and was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> deprived of the advantage of hearing
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> from her son’s lips. To compensate her for this loss, the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
ascended by his own supernatural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> steps to the

transported, and there recited the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months for her benefit.
His return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> seems to have been a more difficult matter; for his
descent was not effected <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the help of a ladder with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

Fa-hien describes this miraculous incident in the following manner
(Legge, 48, abridged):—

  Sa?ka?ya is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> down after ascending to the
  Trayastri??a heaven, and there preaching his <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months for
  his mother’s benefit. <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had ascended there by his supernatural
  power, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his disciples; but seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> before
  his return, Anuruddha, by his own supernatural vision, saw him in
  heaven, and requested Moggallana (see p. 47 of this volume) to ascend
  to Indra’s <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> to inquire after ‘the World-honoured one.’
  Moggallana did so, and returned with the information that in seven
  <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> return. Then the kings of eight countries with
  their people, not having seen <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> time, were all eagerly
  looking up for him to return. But the female mendicant Utpala[215]
  <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> in her heart, ‘To-day, the kings, with their ministers and
  people, are all going to meet Buddha. I am but a woman; how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I
  succeed in being the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him?’ Then Buddha, by his
  supernatural power, changed her into the appearance of a Universal
  Emperor, so that she was the foremost of all to meet and to do
  reverence to him.

  At his descent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights of steps were created. <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> descended
  on the middle flight, composed of the seven precious substances;
  Maha-Brahma, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Brahma heavens (see p. 211 of this volume),
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> down by a flight of silver steps on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side, and ?akra
  (Indra), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of the thirty-three divinities (p. 207), descended by
  steps of gold on the left side, holding a canopy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the seven
  precious substances. An innumerable multitude of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> followed. No
  sooner had the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down than all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights disappeared in
  the ground, except seven steps, which continued to be visible.

  Afterwards <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka, being eager to ascertain where their ends
  rested, sent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to find out by digging. They dug down till they
  reached a yellow spring, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not discover the bottom of the
  steps. Hence the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> felt an increase of devotion, and built a Vihara
  over the steps, with a standing image of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> sixteen cubits high.
  Behind the Vihara he erected a stone pillar, about fifty cubits high,
  with a lion on the top of it. A dispute arose between some heretics
  and the Buddhist monks about the ownership of the place, and the
  former agreed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up their claim if any supernatural sign
  occurred; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the lion on the column gave a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> roar.

Fa-hien adds that a Stupa was erected on the spot where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
descended; <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> where the female mendicant caught the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sight of
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at his descent.

The basement of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka’s pillar was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> by General Cunningham in
1876. On a previous occasion he discovered the capital of the ancient
pillar surmounted by an elephant, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been mistaken by
Fa-hien for a lion (see Cunningham, i. 274).

Hiouen Thsang, in his <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ladders (Beal, i. 202), <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span>
that they were arranged side by side from north to south, so that those
who descended <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have their faces to the east, and that the flight by
which Indra descended was of crystal (not of gold), while that used by
Brahma was of silver, and the Buddha’s steps were of gold (or of the
seven precious substances, of which gold was one). This indicated the
superiority of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> who accompanied him.

In harmony with these ideas Indra and Brahma are sometimes represented
in Buddhistic sculptures standing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> on each side of the Buddha, and
protecting him. They were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> at his birth (see p. 483 and
engraving opposite p. 477).

Hiouen Thsang adds that some centuries before his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the ladders still
existed in their original position; but, when he visited the spot, they
had sunk into the earth, and disappeared. Sa?ka?ya, however, was still
<span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> frequented. A magnificent image of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was preserved in a
large monastery there, and 1000 priests were studying the doctrines of
the Sammatiya, a school of the Hina-yana, in four monasteries.
Furthermore, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> ‘myriads’ of pious laymen lived in the neighbourhood.

The story of Buddha’s descent from <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> by help of golden steps is
commonly believed both in Ceylon and Burma to the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day. The
legend, as current in Ceylon, is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> by Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 311).

It appears that when <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was about to return to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>
Indra’s heaven, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> reflected that, although <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had ascended in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> steps, his descent ought to be celebrated ‘with special honours.’
He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> caused a ladder of gold to extend from the Mountain Meru
(see p. 206 of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Lectures) to Sa?ka?ya, 80,000 Yojanas[216] in
length. The steps were alternately of gold, silver, coral, ruby, emerald
and other gems. At the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side of the ladder he created another, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
of gold, by which Indra, blowing the conch, descended, accompanied by
his own gods; and on the left <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> ladder of silver, by which Brahma
and the Brahma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (p. 210) descended, holding umbrellas over the
Buddha. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> flights of steps appeared to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>

When <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> commenced his descent all the worlds
were illuminated by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> from his body.

With this extravagant myth—believed in as a historical fact by most
Buddhists—we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> contrast the simple narrative of Jacob’s dream in
Genesis xxviii.

Nevertheless the legend is curious, and I was greatly pleased by
discovering in the Indian Section of the South Kensington Museum, a
small bronze model of the triple ladder, lately dug up at Moulmein. Mr.
Purdon Clarke, C.I.E., the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Keeper, kindly had the model
photographed, and presented me with a drawing of it. This I have had
engraved, and here give.

[Illustration: ]

It will be observed that an image of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is represented above the
ladder, as if seated in Indra’s heaven, and as if engaged in the act of
teaching there; while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is typically represented below in the
shape of a square platform, with four small Buddhist temples, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> at
each of the four quarters of the compass (compare p. 85).

A ruder representation of the ladder occurs in the sculptures of the
Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p. 92). The General <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> an imperfect
representation of it carved in soap-stone at Sa?kisa in 1876 (Report,
xi. 26).

considerable centre of Buddhism. At all events, the identification of
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Buddhist sites there has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> clear by Sir A. Cunningham,
who considers Saketa to be the same as the Pi-so-kia (Vi?akha) of Hiouen
Thsang and the Sha-che or Sha-khe of Fa-hien. The former <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> twenty
monasteries there, and 3000 priests studying the Little Vehicle
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the Sammatiya school; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> fifty Deva temples and very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the monasteries resided the Arhat Deva-?arma, who wrote a

the non-existence of any Ego or personal self. A Stupa, 200 feet high,
was built by A?oka in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is supposed to have
preached and taught during six years.

Both Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang mention the legend that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> threw
on the ground a twig he had used to clean his teeth (danta-kash?ha),
which sprouted and grew into a miraculous tree seven cubits high, at
which height it always remained. The Brahmans became jealous of the
miracle and sometimes cut the tree down, sometimes uprooted it, but it
always grew again and remained at the same height. Here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> is the

Beal, i. 240).


                        _Kanya-kubja (Kanouj)._

Kanya-kubja[217] is the Sansk?it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> for the ancient <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Kanouj;
(often spelt Kanoj), once the capital of Northern India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be
the oldest <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> in India, next to Ayodhya.

When Hiouen Thsang visited this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it was the capital of the

this volume), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> kingdom extended from Kashmir to Assam and from the
river Narbada to Nepal. When he carried off a tooth-relic of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
from Kashmir, his procession back to his capital was attended by a large
number of tributary kings. Hiouen Thsang, in describing the piety of
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monarch, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> of him, that ‘he sought to plant the tree of
religious merit to such an extent that he forgot to sleep and to eat.’
He goes on to state as follows:—

  <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> ?iladitya forbade the slaughter of any living <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as food on
  pain of death. He built several thousand Stupas, each about 100 feet
  high. Then in all the highways of the towns and villages throughout
  India he erected hospices, and stationed physicians there with
  medicines for travellers and the poor persons round about. On all
  spots where there were <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> traces of Buddha, he built monasteries.
  Once in five <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> he held the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> assembly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Moksha. Then
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> year he assembled the monks, and bestowed on them the four kinds
  of alms (food, drink, medicine, clothing). He ordered them to carry on
  discussions, and himself judged of their arguments. He rewarded the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and punished the wicked. He promoted the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of talent, and
  degraded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> men. Wherever he moved he dwelt in a travelling-palace,
  and provided choice meats for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of all sorts of religion. Of these
  the Buddhist priests <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be perhaps a thousand; the Brahmans five
  hundred[218]. He divided each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> portions. During the

  he practised himself in religious devotion (Beal, i. 214).

Notwithstanding Hiouen Thsang’s description of various Stupas,
monasteries and monuments seen by him, General Sir A. Cunningham was not
able to identify any of the existing ruins in the neighbourhood of
Kanouj, ‘so completely has almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> trace of Hindu occupation been
obliterated by the Musalmans’ (Report, i. 284).

Fa-hien mentions a Stupa near the town, built on the spot where the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached a discourse on ‘the bitterness and vanity of life,’
comparing it to ‘a bubble or foam on water’ (Legge, 54).


                            _Pa?ali-putra._

Pa?ali-putra (now Patna) seems to have existed as a village at a very
early period. Its ancient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> was Kusuma-pura. It was enlarged and

the well-known patron of Buddhism (p. 66), converted Pa?ali-putra into
the metropolis of the kingdom of Magadha, and it thenceforward became an
important centre of Buddhism. Sir A. Cunningham states that it continued
flourishing as the capital of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Gupta kingdom during the fourth
and fifth centuries of the Christian era.

Fa-hien relates a tradition that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka’s palace in the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> was
built by genii (spirits), who <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rocks and constructed
chambers by heaping them together. He describes a monastery belonging to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Vehicle, and a temple belonging to the Little Vehicle, in the
neighbourhood of the city, and gives an <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of a Buddhist procession
of four-wheeled cars and images which took <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> once a year. Each car
was twenty-two feet or more high, and had five stories, with niches on
four sides, in which were placed images of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the
Bodhi-sattvas, along with images of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> (devas). They were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to
look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> moving pagodas (or Dagabas). The Hindus, as we know, have
similar car-processions to this day, when the images of K?ish?a are
dragged through the streets of towns and villages.

Fa-hien mentions the interesting fact that the nobles of the country had
founded hospitals in the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> to which destitute, crippled, and diseased
persons <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> repair, and receive advice, food, and medicines suited to
their cases, gratuitously. He adds that A?oka, wishing to build 84,000
Stupas[220] in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of the eight originally constructed over the
Buddha’s ashes, built the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Stupa and a pillar near Pa?ali-putra.

Near it he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> was an impression of the Buddha’s foot, over which a
temple with a door towards the north had been erected (Legge, pp. 77-80;
Beal, i. lv-lviii). The position of the Stupa and column has been
discovered by Sir A. Cunningham (xi. 157, 158).


                              _Kesariya._

Kesariya is a large village about thirty miles distant from Vai?ali
(Besarh). It is chiefly remarkable for a mound of ruined brick-work, 62
feet in height, supporting a solid brick Stupa (nearly 68½ feet in
diameter), which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> partly in ruins. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> call it the Stupa
of the Cakravarti (Universal Monarch) Ve?a, <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> P?ithu. In
Manu, VII. 41; IX. 66, 67, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Ve?a is described as an arrogant monarch
who resisted the authority of the Brahmans. Probably he favoured the
Buddhists. At any rate the Buddhists assert that the remarkable Stupa at
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was built to mark the spot where Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> preached a
discourse, in which he described <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his previous births as a
Cakravarti king.

Not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the Stupa a small mound has been excavated, and the head
and shoulders of a colossal statue of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span>
(Cunningham, i. 67).


                             _Ku?i-nagara._

Ku?i-nagara (in Pali Kusi-nara) was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> died,
or—to speak more correctly—passed <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in Pari-nirva?a (see pp. 48, 49,
140). It was <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> searched for in vain, but has recently been identified
by Sir A. Cunningham with the modern Kasia, eighty miles east of
Kapila-vastu, and 120 miles N.N.E. of Benares.

<span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">Neither</span> Fa-hien nor Hiouen Thsang <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> about Ku?i-nagara, except

Then, exerting his

  followers to accompany him to the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Ku?i-nagara. On the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
  there they met a Brahman, who, on being asked whence he came, replied,
  ‘From Ku?i-nagara, where I saw your master entering into Nirva?a. A
  vast multitude of heavenly beings were around him.’

  Ka?yapa having heard these <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> said, ‘The <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> of wisdom has

  proceeded to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> trees, and looking on Buddha, offered worship.
  But <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> careless monks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to another, with satisfaction,

  transgress, who is there to reprove us?’ Then Ka?yapa was deeply
  moved, and resolved to secure obedience to the teaching of Buddha.

  Addressing the assembled multitude, he said, ‘We ought to collect the
  Law. Those who have kept it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> failure, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> powers of

  But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Ka?yapa excluded Ananda as being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> a learner.
  Addressing him, he said, ‘You are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> free from defect; you, too,

  loved him much, and are, therefore, not free from the ties of
  affection.’

  So Ananda retired to a desert place. Wearied out, he desired to lie
  down. Scarcely had his head reached the pillow, when lo! he obtained
  the condition of an Arhat. Then he returned to the door of the
  assembly. But Ka?yapa <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to him, ‘Have you got rid of all ties? If

  paid reverence to the assembled monks, sat down.

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of reducing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the size of an atom, so as to be able

these, and other places, have either been incidentally mentioned in
previous Lectures or will be more fully noticed hereafter.

covered residences, when not itinerating. The five kinds of dwellings
permissible under varying circumstances are described in Culla-vagga

a peculiar shape), storied dwellings (prasada)[221], mansions (harmya),
and caves (see note, p. 81 of this volume).

It is clear that any painful exposure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to the violent storms

not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> instituted ‘the Retreat’ during the rains (Vassa). Hence the
monks were in the habit of going on their travels alike during winter,
summer, and the rainy season.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> complained of this, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the monks in walking about
during wet weather were unable to avoid crushing vegetable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
treading on minute living things. Thereupon the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> prescribed that
the monks were to keep ‘Vassa,’ and refrain from peregrination during
the rains.

Soon afterwards, when the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had left Raja-g?iha and had taken up
his abode during Vassa in the Jeta-vana garden at Savatthi (see p. 407),
a wealthy and pious layman (Upasaka) who had built a monastery (Vihara)
for the monks, sent to invite them to reside in it, <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> that he
wished to hear them recite the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and to bestow gifts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them. The
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> permitted them to go, but required them to return in seven days.
He gave the same permission when <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> rich and pious layman had
provided other residences and conveniences for the monks, such as a
storied house, a mansion, a store-room, a cave, a refectory, a bathing
room, a well-house, a pavilion, a park, etc.

On the other hand, when, on a particular occasion, a monk wished to keep
Vassa in a cattle-pen (Maha-vagga, III. 12) the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> permitted him to
do so. So, again, on <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> occasion he allowed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to keep Vassa in
a caravan, and on a third occasion in a covered boat or ship. But it is
recorded that he prohibited Vassa from being kept in the open air, or in
the hollow of trees[222] (see Maha-vagga, III. 12, 3).

It is evident from all this, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the early <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Buddhism,
rich laymen were in the habit of seeking to acquire religious merit by
providing comfortable habitations for the monks; and although at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
the use of such luxuries was only permitted in the rainy season, this
restriction was soon removed, and a residence in covered dwellings
became usual at all seasons of the year.

Then, as Buddhism spread, kings, princes, and rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> competed with
each other for the privilege of erecting vast monasteries—sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Viharas[223], sometimes Sa?gharamas—to which temples, libraries,
and schools were generally attached, and in which dwelt wealthy
communities of monks, who were allowed to hold property in land.

The founding of extensive and important institutions of this kind was,
of course, an exceptional proceeding. As a general rule, collections of
monastic dwellings were of a simple and unostentatious character. In
various parts of India are to be seen in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> ancient
Buddhist cave-monasteries now untenanted, some of them—such as the caves
of Barabar—as <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as the third century B.C.

I myself visited those at Elora (Elura), twelve miles from Aurangabad in
the Nizam’s territory, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> at Nasik, Karle, and other
places. The Elora caves are possibly as <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as the third century[224],
and with the adjoining Brahmanical and Jain caves of later date, extend
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> mile and a quarter along the scarp of an elevated plateau. The

India—their position side by side proving that the adherents of the

beautiful ‘Caityas’ or halls for general worship (see p. 450),
refectories for commensality, and cells <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> number for the
habitation of the monks. All the excavations had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> partially filled
up; but the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1876 stimulated the Nizam’s
government to clear <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> the dust and rubbish of centuries.

Then, besides cave-monasteries, the ruins of extensive monastic
establishments built of brick, stone, or other less durable materials,
are scattered everywhere throughout India.

Those of the vast monastery of Nalanda near Raja-g?iha, and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> at
various other sacred places, have been already described (see p. 412).

Turning next to the monastic structures of modern Buddhist countries,
and beginning with Ceylon, we find that in that island, as Spence Hardy
has pointed out, and as I myself observed during my sojourn there, the
residences of the monks are of very simple construction, and often
extremely mean in appearance. They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pan-salas (Pa??a-?ala =
Sansk?it Par?a-?ala) because supposed to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of leaves. In general,
however, they are constructed of wattle filled up with mud, the roof
being covered with straw, or with the platted leaves of the cocoa-nut.
They are always dirty and always abound in cobwebs.

A monastery which I saw near Kandy consisted of an oblong rectangular
court-yard, surrounded in the interior by a kind of roofed cloister or
verandah, out of which opened the monks’ cells, lighted only from the
sky above the court. The interior walls of both cloister and cells were
begrimed with patches of dirt and masses of cobwebs, which are <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
touched for fear of breaking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Buddhist commandment, ‘kill not’
(p. 126).

Of course there are monasteries of a better and more imposing type, such
as that attached to the Maligawa temple of the sacred eye-tooth on the
Kandy lake (see p. 454).

In Burma the ordinary residences of the monks appear to be simple in
character, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> those in Ceylon. In Siam, on the contrary, they are
sometimes elaborate, and often have richly-covered entrances. At the
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Siamese monks (according to Mr. Alabaster) are in the
habit of itinerating a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deal, only remaining in their monasteries
during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> months of rains, when residence there is imperative.

Speaking of the larger and more imposing monasteries (Kyoung) in Burma,
Mr. Scott <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> (I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> his <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> in an abbreviated form):—

  The monasteries are built of teak, or, sometimes in Mandalay and Lower
  Burma, of brick. The shape is always oblong, and the inhabited portion
  is raised on posts and pillars, eight or ten feet above the ground.
  They are, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all the other houses in the country, only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> story
  high; for if it is an indignity to a layman to have anyone’s feet over
  his head[225], it is <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more so to a member of the brotherhood. The
  space between the ground and the floor is always kept open, and is
  <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> used except by the monastery school-boys. A flight of steps of
  stone or wood leads up to the verandah, which extends along the north
  and south sides, and frequently all round. From the raised floor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
  reached, rises the building, with tier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> tier of massive roofs (in
  diminishing stages), giving the appearance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> stories when there
  is only one. The accommodation is simple. It consists in the main of a
  central hall divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> portions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> level with the verandah
  where the scholars are taught, and most of the duties of the monastery
  carried on, and the other a dais, raised about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet above the
  level of the rest of the building. Seated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this, the monks are
  accustomed to receive visitors, and at the back, against the wall, are
  arranged the images of Buddha, a large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> usually standing in the
  centre on a kind of altar, with candles, flowers, praying flags, and
  other offerings placed before it. On shelves alongside are a number of
  smaller figures of gold, silver, alabaster, clay or wood, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
  the popularity of the monastery, and the religious character of the
  neighbourhood. Occasionally there are dormitories for the monks, but
  as a rule they sleep in the central hall, where the mats which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
  their beds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen rolled up against the wall. The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> area of
  the extensive compound in which the monastery stands is enclosed by a
  heavy teak fence with massive posts and rails, seven or eight feet
  high. The laity, when they enter, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> off their shoes and carry them
  in their hands. This rule applies to the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> in the land.

The daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the monks inhabiting monasteries of this kind in Burma
has been already described (see pp. 311-314 of these Lectures).

If we now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> to northern Buddhist countries we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> find that, as a
general rule, the dwellings of monks are insignificant tenements of poor
construction, attached to or built round small chapels or shrines.
Sometimes the monks live in the rooms built over such chapels.

Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii. 207) visited a so-called monastery at
Pemyangchi (in Sikkim), which consisted of a single building with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
stories. In the upper some of the monks resided, and a chapel formed the

The temple-monastery I myself visited in British Sikkim, near Darjiling,
is similar. The exterior appearance <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be compared to that of some
small Dissenting chapel in an English village. The thatched roof, which
once gave it a picturesque appearance, has recently been removed, and a
roof of modern construction substituted. The shrine or temple is on the
ground floor, while the upper floor is the abode of the attendant
priests, and seems <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to serve as a store-room with cupboards for
their equipments. The contents of the ground-floor temple, with its
altar at the further <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> and shelves for the sacred books on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side,
are very indistinctly seen, being only lighted up by a ‘dim religious
light,’ when the door is kept wide open. I noticed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> images on the
altar.

The <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> is <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> when large numbers of monks congregate in
particular places. In some districts of Ladak, Mongolia and Tibet,
monasteries (or Lamaseries as they are sometimes called) have been
erected, which for vastness, magnificence, and grandeur of situation
amid splendid scenery, are unequalled in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the world.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to strict rule, retired localities should be chosen. Hence
large monastic establishments are often <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in solitary places[226]
and elevated situations; for instance, in Ladak those at Lama Yurru and
Hemis are more than 11,000 feet above the sea, and that at Hanle is
14,000 feet. They resemble romantic castles towering upwards in the
midst of rocks, crags, and snowy mountains.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> monastery at Kilang (Kyelang), in the British Tibetan province
of Lahul (contiguous to Ladak), stands on the spur of a mountain, at an
elevation of 12,000 feet, and is approached through grand ravines and
glaciers, so that occasionally, after snow-storms, those who <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> to and
fro are buried in avalanches.

The outer walls of large monasteries of this kind in secluded situations
are generally lofty. Often they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of stone or brick, plastered
with mud and surmounted with little pinnacles and poles, on which are
prayer-flags. <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">Within</span> the walls are cells for the monks, the abode of the
Head or Abbot, a room for holding books, a temple, an assembly-hall, a
refectory, store-houses, receptacles for musical instruments, masks,
staves, etc.; the buildings being often arranged in rows, and always
intermixed with Stupas (see p. 504) and monuments. The walls of the
vestibules and of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hall are usually ornamented with
fresco-paintings, representing subjects from the Buddhist Jatakas (p.
111). Generally there are corridors or covered cloisters lined with
prayer-wheels, or open walks paved with stone, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in Sansk?it
Cankrama?a (Pali, Cankamana), for the monks to perambulate up and down
in meditation. These are supposed to be constructed after the pattern of
the stone walking-places used by the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself (see p. 400).

In the monastery at Kilang the roof of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hall is supported by
massive beams garnished with belts, swords, yaks’ tails, huge and
terrible masks, and all sorts of odds and ends. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side is a huge
praying-wheel, on each revolution of which a bell is struck. A dim
subdued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> pervades the entire hall, exaggerating the ghastly
hideousness of the figures[227].

Kumbum) north of Tibet, celebrated as the birth-place of Tsong Khapa (p.
277), and situated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to M. Huc, on a mountain intersected by a
broad and deep ravine:—

  On either side of the ravine, and up the slopes of the mountain, rise,
  in amphitheatrical curves, the white dwellings of the Lamas, each with
  its little terrace and enclosing wall, while here and there above them
  ‘tower the temples, with their gilt roofs glittering with a thousand
  colours.’ The houses of the superior monks are distinguished by
  pennants, floating above small hexagonal turrets, while those of the
  ordinary monks are simple cells. On all sides mystical sentences, in
  the Tibetan character, meet the eye (see p. 381), some inscribed on
  doors, some on walls and stones, or on linen flags fixed on poles.

  Almost everywhere are conical vessels, in which incense and
  odoriferous wood are burning; while numbers of Lamas circulate through
  the streets of the monastery in their red and yellow dresses—grave in
  their deportment, and, although under no obligation to silence,
  speaking little, and that little in a low voice.

This Lamasery of Kunbum enjoys so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a reputation, that the

Tartary, and Tibet, and on the occasion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> festivals the
confluence of strangers is immense. It is <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> frequented by Eastern
Tibetans.

Near Kunbum is a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> smaller monastery, devoted to the study of
medicine. It is at the foot of a rocky mountain, on the heights of which
dwell <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> contemplative monks. M. Huc saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these hermits, who
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> communicated with the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> except for food, which he drew
up to his rocky cell by the help of a bag tied to a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> rope (ii. 73).

Some mention should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the monasteries at Kuku khotun, ‘the
blue city’ in Tartary. That town contains no less than five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
Lamaseries and fifteen affiliated monasteries, with a grand total of
20,000 Lamas dwelling in them. The chief monastery is that of the ‘Five
Towers’—not to be confounded with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in the Chinese
province of Shan si.

This latter is a celebrated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for burials (see p. 370), and pilgrims

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> example of a monastery in a remote situation is that of Kurun or
Kuren (see p. 295), situated on the slope of a mountain in Mongolia. In
this celebrated monastery of the Grand Lama Taranatha 30,000 Lamas
(according to M. Huc) are lodged and supported.

  The plain at the foot of the mountain is constantly covered with tents
  of various sizes for the convenience of pilgrims. Hither throng the
  worshippers of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> from the most remote countries.

  Viewed from a distance, the white cells of the Lamas, built on the
  declivity in horizontal lines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> above the other, resemble the steps
  of an enormous altar, of which the temple of the Taranatha Lama
  appears to constitute (in Roman Catholic phraseology) ‘the
  tabernacle.’ In this country Taranatha is the saint par excellence,
  and there is not a Tartar Khalka who does not <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> a pride in calling
  himself his disciple.

Passing on now to Tibet, we find that in its principal provinces the
number of monastic institutions connected with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> respective
capitals of Lhassa and Tashi Lunpo, is more than a thousand, with
491,242 Lamas. This is the estimate of the latest traveller[228].

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Huc, more than thirty large monasteries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be reckoned in
the neighbourhood of Lhassa alone.

Adverting for a moment to Lhassa itself, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> that this ‘city of
the gods’—the chief town of the province of U, situated on the Ki-chu
river[229]—had in 1854 about 15,000 inhabitants <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> a circumference
of two-and-a-half miles. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to a Chinese proverb, its chief
inmates have always been ‘priests, women, and dogs.’ Koeppen affirms
that Lhassa has always been a greater nest of monk-priests than Rome has
ever been.

Doubtless its population is now increased, and includes a considerable
proportion of laymen; yet, in all likelihood, at least two-thirds of the
inhabitants are monks; and it <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be too often repeated that,

Moreover, Lhassa, next to Benares and Mecca, is, perhaps, the most
frequented <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth. Scarcely a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> passes on
which the streets do not overflow with crowds of pilgrims—some from

some from all parts of Mongolia. All meet here to worship the incarnated
representative of the Bodhi-sattva (Avalokite?vara) manifested in the
Dalai Lama—to receive his blessing, his consecrated pills, and his
prayer-papers (see p. 331 of these Lectures). The residence of this
Lamistic Pope is at Potala.

In fact Potala on the north-west side of Lhassa is what the Vatican is
to Rome. It existed in ancient times as a palace, but was rebuilt and
converted into a palace-monastery by the celebrated fifth Dalai Lama
Navang Lobsang, A.D. 1617-1682 (p. 292 of this volume), and from that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> forward became the residence of all the Dalai Lamas, who had before
lived either at Sera or at Brepung (Dapung, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 442).

In its striking and unique position, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more imposing than the
Vatican.

Imagine a lofty structure erected on an isolated hill[230], rising
abruptly from the plain with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> summits or eminences, and

Tsanpo. The south-western ridge is the so-called Iron-hill, on which is
a monastery where Tsong Khapa himself is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have taught. The
north-eastern bears the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the Phagmo hill[231], while the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span>
is the hill of Potala, with its palace-monastery towering in four
stories to the height of about 367 feet, and ending in a cupola covered
with plates of pure gold.

From this vantage ground the incarnated Bodhi-sattva looks down on the
crowds of pilgrims approaching to worship him, or kneeling at the foot
of the hill. The buildings grouped in the vicinity are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to contain

statues of Buddha, with other idols and images of saints, not to mention
obelisks and pyramidal monuments, which meet the eye everywhere. All
sacred objects are manufactured out of gold, silver, or copper,

ascending avenues lead up from Lhassa to Potala, which are constantly

  We rode to the foot of the mountain on which the palace is built, or
  out of which, rather, it seems to grow; but having ascended a few
  paces to a platform, were obliged to dismount. From here to the hall
  where the Grand Lama receives visitors is a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and tedious ascent.
  It consists of about four hundred steps, partly stone steps in the
  rocky mountain, and the rest mere ladders from story to story in the
  palace. Besides this, from interval to interval along the mountain,
  wherever the ascent is easy, there are stretches interspersed, where
  the path continues for several paces <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> steps. At length
  we arrived at the large platform on which is built the hall of
  reception. There we rested awhile, arranged the presents, and
  conferred with the Lama’s Chinese interpreter.

  The Tí-mu-fu was in the hall with the Grand Lama. I was not informed
  of this until I entered, which occasioned me some confusion. I did not
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> how <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> ceremony to go through with one, before I began with the
  other. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the due obeisance, touching the ground <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times with
  my head to the Grand Lama, and once to the Tí-mu-fu. I presented my
  gifts, delivering the coin and the handsome silk scarf with my own
  hands into the hands of the Grand Lama. I then took off my hat, and
  humbly gave him my clean-shaven head to lay his hands upon. The
  ceremony of presentation being over, the Munshi and I sat down on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
  cushions not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the Lama’s throne, and had tea <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to us. It
  was most excellent, and I meant to have emptied the cup, but it was
  whipped <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> suddenly, before I was aware of it. The Lama’s beautiful
  and interesting face and manner engrossed almost all my attention. He
  was at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> about seven <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> old; and had the simple and
  unaffected manners of a well-educated princely child. His face was, I
  thought, poetically and affectingly beautiful. He was of a gay and
  cheerful disposition; his beautiful mouth perpetually unbending into a
  graceful smile, which illuminated his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> countenance. Sometimes,
  particularly when he had looked at me, his smile approached to a
  gentle laugh. No doubt my grim beard and spectacles somewhat excited
  his risibility. He inquired whether I had not met with molestation and
  difficulties on the road; to which I promptly returned the proper
  answer. A <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> of dried fruit was <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> and <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> before me, and
  then we withdrew. (Mr. Clements Markham’s Tibet, p. 264, abridged.)

As to the monasteries grouped around this Vatican of Lamistic Buddhism,
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> special mention of four, noting a few particulars.

To begin with the oldest monastery, that of _La brang_, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to mean
‘abode of Lamas[233],’ which was built by <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Srong Tsan Gampo (see p.
271 of this volume), and founded in the seventh century. This ancient
institution is in the very centre of Lhassa, and is regarded as the
centre of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> country. All the main roads of Tibet converge
towards it. Doubtless the area of the monastery has been enlarged by
occasional additions in the course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thousand years, but not <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span>
it was partly rebuilt and restored in the seventeenth century. Its
magnificent temple (Cho Khang) is the St. Peter’s of Lamism (see p.
459).

The immense number of monks inhabiting this monastery is proved by the
fact that a huge cauldron is shown which holds more than 1200 gallons of
tea for the Lamas who perform the daily services.

The other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> monasteries near Potala and La brang, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
Koeppen, are devoted to the study of magic and the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> of exorcising. We
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> them in the following order:—

First, at a short distance north of La brang, stands the monastery
_Ramoche_, ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> enclosure,’ which was the other ancient monastery
built by Srong Tsan Gampo, or by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his wives (see p. 271). It is
now a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> school of exorcism, and has a celebrated temple (see pp.
462, 463), containing the celebrated image of the Buddha, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of Nanda, Gautama’s step-brother and disciple. Those who study here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
gain the decree of ‘Doctor of Magic.’

Next comes the monastery of _Moru_ (or Muru or Meru), close to the city.
It is noted for its <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> and cleanliness, and for its printing-press.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the last, it contains a school for instruction in magic.

Then, at a short distance east of La brang (according to Koeppen), is
the monastery of _Gar Ma Khian_—the mother monastery of soothsayers,
fortune-tellers, and exorcisers (Chos-kyong, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p. 266).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us next turn to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ancient ‘mother-monasteries’ of the Yellow
sect—Galdan, Sera, and Dapung.

_Galdan_ (_or Gahdan_), the ‘heaven of contented beings’ (Sansk?it
Tushita, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> pp. 207, 213)—the oldest monastery of the Yellow sect—is
situated on the hill of the same name, about thirty miles[234] east of
Lhassa. As already stated (pp. 278, 294), it was founded by Tsong Khapa
A.D. 1409. It is three-quarters of a mile in circumference, and has 3300
monks.

_Sera_, ‘the golden,’ founded by Tsong Khapa (p. 278), or by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his
disciples immediately after his death, lies about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> miles north of
Lhassa, on a declivity of a hill, over which passes the road leading to
Mongolia. It has 5500 monks, and numerous temples, towers, and houses
curving round <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> an amphitheatre. On the hills above the town are rows
of cells of contemplative monks and recluses.

Sera has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temples several stories high, the halls of which
are richly gilded. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> temple the staff of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is
preserved.

_Dapung_ (variously Dapu?, Depung, Debung, Debang, Brepung, Brebung,

miles west of the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa. It has 7700 monks. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple in
the middle is surrounded by four small ones. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of these four belongs
to the exorcisers and professors of magical arts, of whom there are
nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred. In the centre of the monastery is a residence for
the Dalai Lama, when he pays his annual visit. Numbers of foreigners
study here, especially Mongolians. In front of the monastery stands a
Stupa, which contains the bones of the fourth Dalai Lama, Jon Tan Yam
Thso, who was of a Mongolian family.

Mr. Edgar (Report, p. 41) mentions four other monasteries of the Yellow
sect around Lhassa, _Chemiling_, _Tengiling_, _Chechuling_, and
_Kenduling_[235]. The last is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be the residence of the Regent (p.
286 of these Lectures). Sarat Chandra Das gives a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> list of
monasteries, some containing 5000 monks (e.g. Rnam rgyal grvatsang,
Gongdkar rDorjegdan, etc.) and some 7000.

We have next to describe the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> monastery of the second Grand Lama of

_Tashi Lunpo_, near _Shigatse_, is the seat of government of the Tashi
Lama or Panchen Lama (see p. 284 of these Lectures), and the second
metropolis of Lamistic Buddhism.

140 English miles in a nearly westerly direction from Lhassa. It is
built on a level plain enclosed on all sides by rocky hills, through
which a small river (the Painam) rushes into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Tsanpo

Near at hand, on the north-east side of the Tashi Lunpo monastery, on a
rocky eminence protecting it from the cold winds, stands the fort of
Shigatse (also written Shigatze), which, with its surrounding houses,
forms the capital of the province of Tsang, just as Lhassa constitutes
that of the province of U.

Our fellow countryman, Mr. Bogle, commissioned by Warren Hastings to
open communications between Bengal and Tibet, arrived at Tashi Lunpo in
1774. His description of it is to the following effect. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> it
abbreviated (from Mr. Clements Markham’s Tibet):—

  We passed by the foot of Tashi Lunpo, which is built on the lower
  declivity of a steep hill. The roof of the palace is all of
  copper-gilt. The building is of dark-coloured brick. The houses of the
  town rise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> above another. Four churches with gilt ornaments are
  mixed with them. Altogether the town presents a princely appearance.

  galleries running round them. The alleys, which are likewise paved,
  are narrow. The palace is appropriated to the Lama and his officers,
  to temples, granaries, warehouses, etc. The rest of the town is
  entirely inhabited by priests, who are in number about four thousand.

The following is the substance of Mr. Bogle’s <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of his interview
with the Tashi Lama on November 8, 1774 (abbreviated from Markham’s
Tibet):—

  In the afternoon I had my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> audience of the Tashi Lama. He is
  about forty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, of low stature, and inclining to be fat. His
  complexion is fairer than that of most Tibetans, and his arms are as
  white as those of a European; his hair, which is jet black, is cut
  very short; his eyes are small and black. The expression of his
  countenance is smiling and good-humoured. He was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his throne,
  formed of wood carved and gilt, with some cushions above it, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
  which he sat with his legs folded under him. He was dressed in a
  mitre-shaped cap of yellow broadcloth, with <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> bars lined with red
  satin, a yellow cloth jacket <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> sleeves, and a satin mantle of
  the same colour thrown over his shoulders. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side of him stood
  his physician, with a bundle of perfumed sandal-wood rods burning in
  his hand; on the other stood his cup-bearer. I laid the Governor’s
  presents before him, delivering the letter and the pearl necklace into
  his own hands, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with a white handkerchief on my own part,
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the custom of the country. He received me in the most
  engaging manner. I was seated on a high stool covered with a carpet.
  Plates of boiled mutton, boiled rice, dried fruits, sweetmeats, sugar,
  bundles of tea, dried sheep’s carcases, etc., were <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> before me and
  my companion, Mr. Hamilton. The Lama drank <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> dishes of tea
  with us, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> any grace, asked us once or twice to eat,
  and on our retiring threw white handkerchiefs over our necks. After
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> visits, he used to receive me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any ceremony, his
  head uncovered, and dressed only in the large red petticoat worn by
  all full monks, red boots, a yellow cloth vest, with his arms bare,
  and a piece of coarse yellow cloth thrown across his shoulders. He sat
  sometimes in a chair, sometimes on a bench covered with tiger-skins,
  and nobody but the cup-bearer present. Sometimes he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> walk with me
  about the room, explain the pictures, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> some remarks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
  colour of my eyes, etc. For, although venerated as God’s vicegerent
  through all the eastern countries of Asia, and endowed with a portion
  of omniscience and with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attributes, he throws aside
  in conversation all the awful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of his character, accommodates
  himself to the weakness of mortals, endeavours to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> himself loved
  rather than feared, and behaves with the greatest affability to
  everybody, particularly to strangers.

In 1783, when Tashi Lunpo was visited by Captain Turner, the monastery
consisted of 400 houses, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of which were built of stone and marble,
and at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories high. They contained about 3700 monks (now
3800). Around the houses were gilded temples, pinnacles, pyramidal
monuments (Stupas), and above all the palace of the Tashi Lama, forming
a striking spectacle.

Captain Turner had a remarkable interview with the Grand Lama at the
neighbouring monastery of Terpaling, on December 4, 1783. He <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the
princely child, then aged eighteen months, seated on a throne, with his
<span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and mother standing on the left hand. Having been informed that,
although unable to speak, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> understand, Captain Turner intimated
to him ‘that the Governor-General, on receiving news of his decease, had
been overwhelmed with sorrow, and continued to lament his absence from
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> until the cloud was dispelled by his re-appearance. The
Governor hoped that he <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> continue to illumine the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by his
presence.’

The infant looked steadfastly at the British envoy, and appeared to be
listening to his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> with deep attention, while he repeatedly nodded
his head, as if he understood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> syllable. He was silent and sedate,
and conducted himself with astonishing dignity. Captain Turner <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span>
him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the handsomest <span class="t1 t5 t7 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> he had ever seen. It seems that he
grew up to be an able and devout ruler, gratifying the Tibetans by his
presence for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> years, and living to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> age.

Tashi Lunpo was not visited by the French missionaries, but M. Huc
informs us (ii. 157) that in 1846 the then Panchen Lama was 60 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of
age, and still vigorous. M. Huc was told that he was of Indian origin,
and that he had declared of himself that his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> incarnation had taken

and is abbreviated):—

  In the afternoon we arrived at Tashi Lunpo. In front of the western
  entrance I noticed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chortens (that is, ‘Caityas or Stupas,’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> p.

  other small. On entering the grand monastery, I mustered all my
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Buddhist ceremonies and monkish etiquette, that I <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span>
  not be criticised by the passing monks as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> unacquainted with the
  duties of the wearers of the sacred costume. I walked slowly and with
  gravity, but secretly observing everything around me. There were a few
  yaks under the charge of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four herdsmen, waiting probably for
  the return of some of their number from <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the monastery. Some
  monks, riding on mules, passed us from north to south. A few parties
  with heavy grain packages on their backs were entering the monastery
  along with us. The rays of the sun, now slanting on the gilded spires
  of houses and tombs in the monastery, presented a very magnificent
  view to the eye.

  While residing in the monastery I saw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> busily engaged in
  out-door work, such as collecting fuel and tending cattle. In fact,
  this was the busiest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the year, when the Tibetans remain on the

  intensely cold winds wither up the vegetation, freeze the streams,
  harden the soil, and dry up the skin. The monks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the lay-people,
  are remarkable for their habit of early rising. No monk <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
  walls of the monastery rose later than five in the morning, and the
  usual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for getting up was four a. m. Those who slept later,

About six miles from Tashi Lunpo, and on the road leading from it in a
south-westerly direction towards the monastery of Sakya (see below), is
the monastery of _Narthang_, whence issued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> copies of

journey to Lhassa[236], and by Sarat Chandra Das in 1882. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of its

have worked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> miracles—such as filling empty jars with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
water—at Sam ye. He undertook to expel all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> demons from Tibet, but
was opposed by the Bon priests.

The other chief monastery of the Red sect is that of _Sakya_ (Saskya),
situated about fifty-five miles from Tashi Lunpo, on the road leading in
a south-westerly direction towards Nepal. It has four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sanctuaries
and a celebrated library, and is surrounded by a large town, with
temples and houses mostly painted red (p. 273).

It should be noted that in all the large monasteries of Northern
Buddhist countries, varied assortments of vestments, robes, costumes,
and masks are kept for use in the religious dances, masquerades, and
dramatic performances which are a characteristic of Northern Buddhism.
Indeed, some of the richer monasteries possess extensive wardrobes of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> value, and the monks in their masquerading dances change their
costumes very frequently and with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rapidity (see pp. 347-350).

Note, too, that the libraries of such monasteries generally contain
large and valuable collections of books. The 108 volumes of the northern
canon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Kanjur, with the commentaries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tanjur (see p. 272),
constitute a library in themselves. In addition to these, there are vast
numbers of other treatises written to elucidate the mysteries of
Northern Buddhism, most of which are still a terra incognita to European
scholars. It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that in mediæval times some Buddhist
monasteries became seats of learning, which <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> have vied with the
most learned Universities established at that period in Europe.


                               _Temples._

Although temples have been already adverted to as forming an important
feature in all monasteries, and often an actual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the edifice
constituting the monastery; it will be worth while to devote a short
space of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to their separate consideration.

In the earliest <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Buddhism <span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> temples nor halls nor rooms for
meeting <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> (sa?gha-g?iha) were <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> needed. The monk recited the
<span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> in the open air or in the houses of the laity. It was only when
collections of monks crystallized into regularly organized communities,
and a kind of congregational recitation of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> became a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> day’s duty, that the monks required places of assembly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
churches for the performance of religious services.

Such places of meeting were often, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the cells for the monks,
excavated out of rocks. And, <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> relic-shrines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Caityas (as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>

excavated hall, the hall itself was generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Caitya.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal rock-excavated Caitya-halls visited by me were at
Elora (also spelt Ellora and Elura) and at Karle (Karli). I was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

structure they are all strikingly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> ancient Christian churches.

The _Elora_ Caitya forms <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the series of caves already mentioned
(p. 169). It is probably as <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as the sixth century of our era, and is
of an elongated horse-shoe shape, with a massive ribbed roof arched <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
that of a cathedral, supported on twenty-eight octagonal columns, over
which runs a curious frieze, having on it a carved representation of a
buffalo-hunt and boar-chase. There is a nave with side-aisles about 86
feet <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> by 43 broad. Moreover, over the entrance, supported by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
square columns, is a gallery which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have served for a choir or for a
band of musicians. A lofty solid Dagaba, in shape <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a massive dome
resting on a cylindrical base, stands at the further <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the nave,
the aisles being continued round it, so that worshippers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
circumambulate the apse. The front of this immense relic-receptacle is
hollowed out to receive a colossal sedent figure of the Buddha, about 17
feet high[237], with the Bodhi-tree carved in an arch above his head.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> images of attendants are in an erect attitude, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> on each side, but
are not so prominent as to draw off the eye from the immense central
figure.

The Brahmans have now appropriated this cave, and dedicated it to
Vi?va-karma, the supposed patron deity of builders and carpenters. I was
told that carpenters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from all parts of the country to worship the
image in its Brahmanical character. As a token of honour, they smear it
with red paint.

I noticed a remarkable sculpture carved out of the rock near this
cave-temple. It represented worshippers praying to Padma-pani to be
delivered from fire, from sword, from captivity, from wild beasts, from
snakes, and from the skeleton <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Death</span> who is seen approaching.

The Caitya cave at _Karle_, near Poona, which I visited in 1876, is in
all its dimensions and arrangements similar to the Vi?va-karma cave at
Elora, but is still larger, finer, and more imposing. It has a nave and
side aisles, terminating in an apse, round which the aisle is carried.
The <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> is about 124 feet <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> by 45½ feet broad and 46 feet in
height. There are fifteen pillars on each side, separating the nave from
the aisles, and under the dome of the apse is the Dagaba (or Caitya)—a
two-storied cylindrical drum, surmounted by a Tee ornament (p. 456), on
which is a wooden umbrella. There is a cavity in the Dagaba for relics,
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> none are now to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> there.

This wonderful excavation at Karle is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most magnificent
monuments of ancient Buddhism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most interesting examples
of early Buddhistic <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> to be seen anywhere in India. And, more than
this, it is probably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most striking places of congregational
worship to be seen anywhere in the world.

Of course these rock-excavated churches soon developed into temples
(Viharas) built of stone or brick, some of which were of a monumental
character, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that at Buddha-Gaya, already described (see p. 390),
while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> were unpretending structures near villages, where the laity
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> repeat their prayers or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> offerings. Others, again, formed the
most important edifice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the group of buildings constituting a
monastery.

The village temples <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> more suitably be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> chapels. All have some
features in common. At the further <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of a dimly-lighted room is an
altar of stone or wood. On this are placed the idols, and around them
are arranged vases and cups, in which the offerings of the laity are
deposited. The larger edifices have vestibules, and at the entrance are
generally rude images of the four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> kings (p. 206), who are supposed
to be the guardians of Buddhism (p. 206), while inside there are
sculptures, frescoes, and pictures illustrative of the various births
and transmigrations of the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas. In the precincts
is always to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree, p. 519), if the climate and
soil will admit of its being reared. The greater number of sacred
structures, however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> those of a more important kind and more
entitled to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> temples, are mere square or oblong rectangular
buildings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> architectural design or ornamentation.

In Ceylon I visited a temple of this kind on the shore of the Kandy
lake. It consisted of a large bare room or small hall, at the further
<span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of which was a curtain concealing a highly venerated image of the
Buddha. The attendant drew aside the curtain and showed us the image,
which had representations of rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> issuing from all parts of his
body, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as five rays emerging from the crown of his head. In the
enclosure or ‘compound’ of the temple, was a bell-shaped Dagaba or
relic-shrine of solid brick-work, covered with Chunam, and having a
receptacle for lights in front of it. Close at <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> was the usual sacred
Pipal-tree.

At _Kelani_, about eight miles from Colombo, is a larger and <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more
important temple which I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> visited. Those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> pilgrimages to
this temple gain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> stores of merit. It contains a colossal recumbent
image of the Buddha, thirty-six feet long, lying on his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side, and
representing the founder of Buddhism when about to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> into
Pari-nirva?a (see p. 50). The image is protected by a screen, in the
centre of which is a figure of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of Serpents, while at the sides
are gigantic images of the temple-guardians. Around the interior are
fresco paintings of various incidents in the previous lives of the
Buddha. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> images of the Hindu <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> Vish?u, ?iva, and Ga?e?a
(see p. 206). In the garden of the temple are residences for the monks,
a cloister-like enclosure, a room with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> printing press, and an
immense Pipal-tree.

A still more important temple is that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Dalada Maligawa or
temple of the sacred eye-tooth, at Kandy in Ceylon. This is a very
picturesque structure, situated on the margin of the lake close to the
town. It has no surrounding walls, and is easily accessible to all
comers. Steps lead up to a kind of open corridor, in which is the main
entrance, and the walls of which are decorated with coloured frescoes of
the eight principal hells—the supposed abode of evil-doers undergoing
purgatorial torments during <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of their states of existence (see p.
120)[238].

Some are represented in the act of being cut in pieces by demons, or
fixed on red-hot iron spikes, or torn asunder with glowing tongs, or
sawn in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> with saws, or crushed between rocks, or consumed by flames
entering the apertures of their bodies. The European visitor inquires
with amazement how it is that a system so mild, merciful, and tolerant,
should have invented the horrible tortures here exhibited. The
explanation is not difficult, and his astonishment ceases when he is
reminded that Buddhism, recognizing no moral Governor of the Universe,
is compelled to resort to such artifices for the coercion and
intimidation of evil-doers.

In the interior of the building is the shrine, in which is preserved
behind iron bars, the golden Dagaba or receptacle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the Buddha’s

shrine, the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> chamber was redolent with the fragrance of masses of
flowers—chiefly jasmine—recently deposited before them as offerings.

Behind the building I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> an open quadrangle with cells for the monks,
and a residence for the Head of the monastery. Not <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> from the entrance
was a spacious library, where I was greeted by a number of youthful
monks, dressed in simple toga-like vestments, but with their <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
shoulders left bare. Some were engaged in writing. I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> asked for

Rangoon pagoda is the grandest and most crowded with worshippers and
pilgrims.

The peculiar sacredness and popularity of this wonderful structure (said
to have been founded 588 B.C.), arises from its containing relics of
Gautama and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> predecessors, that is, eight hairs from Gautama’s
head, the staff of Ka?yapa, the robe of Kanaka-muni, and the
drinking-cup of Kraku-cchanda (see p. 135 of these Lectures). The
stately pile stands <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a mound—partly natural, partly artificial—cut

of the compass. The ascent is by very dilapidated steps, some of stone,
some of ‘sun-dried bricks, worn almost into a slope by the bare feet of
myriads of worshippers.’ None but Europeans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> ascend with covered
feet. The stairs lead to a ‘broad, open flagged space, which runs all
round the pagoda, and is left free for worshippers.’ From the centre of
this springs, from an octagonal plinth, the ‘profusely gilt _solid
brick_ pagoda,’ which has a circumference of 1355 feet, and rises to a
height of about 328, ‘or nearly as high as St. Paul’s cathedral.’ On the
summit is ‘the Tee,’ a gilt umbrella-shaped ornament with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> tiers of
rings, on each of which ‘hang multitudes of gold and silver jewelled
bells.’ It was ‘placed there at a cost of not <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> less than
£50,000[239].’ At the foot of the pagoda are four chapels, having
colossal figures of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at the sides, and their gilded interiors
darkened by the vapour of thousands of burning tapers. ‘Hundreds of
Gautamas,’ large and small, white and black, gilded and plain, sitting,
standing, and reclining, surround the larger images. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the

There is a still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> pagoda (332 feet high) at Pegu, and the most
ancient of all is at Arakan.

Passing to Northern Buddhist countries, we find that the temples are
generally simple, and not to be compared with the grand pagodas of
Burma.

For example, at Tassiding in Sikkim, Sir Richard Temple (Journal, ii.
204) <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principal temples were chapel-like structures
with ‘overshadowing umbrella-shaped roofs, thatched with split bamboos.’
The walls were of rough stone, the upper half being painted red. The
interiors, which were dimly lighted, had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> stories, the walls being
covered with coloured frescoes illustrating the punishments in the
various hells, ‘some of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be suitable for illustrations of
Dante’s Inferno.’ The ends opposite to the entrance were filled with
images. In other parts of the chapels were praying-machines, and on
shelves the remnants of a library of sacred Buddhist manuscripts. Sir
Richard attended a religious service in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these chapels, which
consisted of a series of chants and invocations to a female demon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

to tradition, it was the malevolent action of the twelve Tanmas in
bringing pestilences on the Tibetans, that led them to send for
Padma-sambhava, who introduced the debased Buddhism subsequently
prevalent in Tibet (Note by Capt. R. C. Temple).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 189) and Koeppen the generality of

room, with an entrance-hall or vestibule, which in Mongolia looks to the

206 of this volume). Sometimes there are side chambers, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

chambers often have shelves for the sacred books, wrapped in silk. In
the corners are tables for images of the deities, religious dresses,
musical instruments, etc. Other articles required for the daily service
are hung up on wooden pegs along the walls. Benches for the Lamas are
placed in the hall of the temple.

The altar at the further extremity rises in steps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of wood,

there are no side windows. On the outside of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> secondary naves is

separated from the naves by a silver lattice-work. Here, at the ordinary
services, are the seats of the inferior monks. From the west transept a
staircase leads to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> pillared transept, which forms the vestibule
of the sanctuary. In the middle of the sanctuary, which is square in

the sanctuary, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> in the furthest recess of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>

the throne of the Dalai Lama, very lofty, richly adorned and furnished
with five cushions, as is customary in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of Grand Lamas. On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
side of the Dalai Lama’s throne is a similar throne for the Panchen
Lama, and then, in regular order, the thrones of the Khutuktus and other
Avatara Lamas. The Khanpos and the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> non-Avatara monkhood have seats
in the transept.

Opposite to the throne of the Dalai Lama, on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> of the niche, is
the chair of the Regent, which is less elevated than the thrones of the
Avatara Lamas. Behind are the seats of the four ministers, which again
are less elevated than those of the non-Avatara Lamas. At the west <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span>
of the niche is the high altar, which rises in numerous steps. On the
upper steps are small images of deified saints, in massive gold or
silver. On the lower ones, as on all Buddhist altars, are lamps,
incense-holders, bowls for offerings, etc. On the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> elevation,
behind silver and golden lattice-work, is the celebrated image of
Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> richly gilded. This image is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been

Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas (such as Dipa?kara, Amitabha, Maitreya, the
eleven-faced Avalokite?vara, Mañju-?ri, etc.), besides <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and

oil-burners were lighted in the court of the temple, and those before
the principal image were all of gold. He <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> some of the subordinate
chapels infested by mice, which are <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> touched, because supposed to
be metamorphosed monks. He observed some Buddhists from Nepal chanting
Sansk?it hymns, and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> engaged in circumambulation, while the
muttering of Om Ma?i padme Hum (p. 372) was incessant.

  a high and wide porch. About thirty monks were solemnly seated to

  supported the roof. The image <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by the Nepalese princess, lay
  midway between the pillars. It was grand-looking; and, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> its face
  was gilded, its antiquity was manifest. In the northern lobby of the
  temple was a vast collection of ancient relics, such as shields,
  spears, drums, arrows, sabres, <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> knives, trumpets, etc. In a room
  to the left of the entrance, enclosed by iron lattice-work, were a few
  images considered especially sacred. We were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> shown a brass

princess being thoroughly versed in astrology, <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that there was a
spot close to the new-built <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Lhassa which was connected with the
lower regions of torment. On that plot of ground she erected the shrine
of Ramoche, on the chief altar of which she placed the famous statue of
Buddha, <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from China. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> she hoped to intercept the

Mr. Bogle (Markham’s Tibet, p. 100) describes the temple in the
monastery at Tashi Lunpo as simply a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> room or gallery containing
thirteen gigantic figures <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of copper gilt, all in a sedent attitude,
with their legs folded under them. He <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> them all draped, with
jewelled crowns and necklaces of coral, pearls, and other stones. The
thrones on which they sat were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of copper gilt, and adorned with
turquoises and cornelians. Behind them were a variety of conch-shells,
<span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> in silver, ostrich-eggs, cocoa-nuts, and other articles. At each <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span>
of the gallery was a large collection of books deposited in
pigeon-holes. Mr. Bogle was <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> when the Tashi Lama himself entered
the temple, and, as he passed along, sprinkled rice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the images.
This was a kind of consecration-ceremony.

As an instance of the tolerant character of Buddhism and its readiness
to accommodate itself to the indigenous creeds of the countries into
which it was introduced, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> note, in conclusion, that in Japan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

just as it adopted Shamanism in Tibet. It took the deities and demi-gods
of Shintoism and turned them into Bodhi-sattvas[243].

                          _Images and Idols._


On several occasions during my travels through all parts of India, I
asked intelligent Pa??its how they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> reconcile the gross idolatry
and fetish-worship which meet the eye at almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> step throughout
the length and breadth of their land, with the doctrine repeatedly
declared to be the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> creed of Brahmanism—the doctrine that
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> really exists but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> eternal, omnipresent <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of the
Universe (named <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or Brahma)[244].

The answer I generally received to this inquiry was, that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
worship was at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the only <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of religion dominant in India, till
the Buddhists <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> the example of worshipping material objects and images
(pratima-puja).

Of course it is impossible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> what amount of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be in

image-worship in the Buddhist Pi?akas. The statement that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself sanctioned idolatry is wholly legendary (see p. 177). Nor is
there any proof that carved images of his person were common in India
till several centuries after his death.

The Bharhut sculptures of about the second century B.C.—though
representing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> scenes connected with the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (see pp. 408,
523)—exhibit no representations of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. Nor are there any
on the Sanchi gateway of still later date.

The only objects of reverence in the Bharhut sculptures, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
Sir A. Cunningham, are Bodhi-trees, Wheels, the Tri-ratna symbol,
Stupas, and foot-prints (see pp. 521-522 of these Lectures). The
bas-reliefs on the railing at the Buddha-Gaya Temple, which is of a
little earlier date, agree in making the Tree, Wheel, Tri-ratna, and
Stupa the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> objects of reverence. On the other hand, in the edicts
of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka veneration for the Bodhi-tree alone is enjoined. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the
historical scenes represented in the Bharhut sculptures, are the
processions of the kings Ajata-?atru and Prasenajit on their visits to
the Buddha; ‘the former on his elephant, the latter in his chariot,

inscribed on which corresponds to about A.D. 142. The engraving
(opposite) is from a photograph of this statue, belonging to Sir A.
Cunningham[245]. The thick lips are certainly remarkable. The attitude
was probably the ‘argumentative’ or ‘teaching’ (described at p. 481).

It was <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> by a strange irony of fate that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who denied any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>

carvings in bas-relief, paintings, and representations of him in all
attitudes are absolutely innumerable. In caves, monasteries, and
temples, on Dagabas, votive Stupas, monuments and rocks, they are
multiplied infinitely and in endless variety, and not only are isolated
images manufactured out of all kinds of materials, but rows on rows are
sculptured in relief, and the greater the number the greater religious
merit accrues to the sculptor, and—if they are dedicated at sacred
places—to the dedicator also.

And not only images of the Buddha, but representations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> object

It was only natural that the disciples of an ideally perfect man, who
had taught them that in passing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> absolutely
extinct, should have devised some method of perpetuating his memory and
stimulating a desire to conform to his example. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> method was
to preserve the relics of his burnt body, and to honour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> object
associated with his earthly career. Then, in process of time, they began
to worship not only his relics but the receptacles under which they were
buried, and around these they placed sculptures commemorative of his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and teaching. Thence they passed on to the carving or moulding of
small statuettes of his person in wood, stone, metal, terra-cotta, or
clay, and on these they often inscribed the well-known Buddhistic
formulæ mentioned before (see p. 104). Eventually, too, painting was
pressed into the service, and frescoes on walls became common. <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">Indeed</span> in
some temples paintings <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of images, as objects of
adoration.

It seems likely that the use of images and paintings was at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
confined to the brotherhood, and it is alleged that they were only
honoured and not worshipped. But the more the circle of uncultured and
unthinking Buddhists became enlarged, the more did visible
representations of the founder of Buddhism <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> needed, and the more
they became multiplied.

Nor was this all. The reaction from the original simplicity of Buddhism
led to a complete repudiation of its anti-theistic doctrines. It adopted
polytheistic superstitions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more rapidly and thoroughly than
Brahmanism did. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> were not satisfied with representations of the
founder of Buddhism. They craved for other visible and tangible objects
of adoration—for the images of other Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas—of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> and lords many—insomuch that a Buddhist Pantheon was gradually
created which became peopled with a more motley crowd of occupants than
that of Brahmanism and Hinduism.

Furthermore, it was only natural that the manufacture of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> array
of divinities and semi-divinities, of saints and sages, should have been
committed to the monks. They alone possessed this privilege. They alone,
too, had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of consecrating each image by the repetition of
mystical texts and formularies. And when images and idols were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
consecrated, they were believed to be animated with the spirit, and to
possess all the attributes of the beings they represented.

In fact, the development of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> phase of idolatrous superstition
reached a point of extravagance unparalleled in any other religious
system of the world. The monks of Buddhism vied with each other in the
‘pious fraud’ with which they constructed their idols. They so
manipulated them that they appeared to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> or to flash
supernatural glances from their crystal eyes. Or they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> them deliver
oracular utterances, or they furnished them with movable limbs, so that
a head <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> unexpectedly nod, or a <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> be raised to bless the
worshipper. Then they clothed them with costly vestments, and adorned
them with ornaments and jewels, and treated them in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as if they
were living energizing personalities.

It ought, however, to be noted here, that in some temples images of the
Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to exist which were not manufactured
or consecrated by monks. They were believed to have been self-produced,
or to have been created supernaturally out of nothing, or to have
emerged in a miraculous manner out of vacuity. The child-like faith of
uncultured and imaginative races in the virtue supposed to be inherent
in such images was perhaps not surprising. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of working all
kinds of miracles was gradually ascribed to them; sicknesses were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
to be healed by them, rain to be produced, and the course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Chinese pilgrims Fa-hien and Hiouen Thsang are <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> tired of
describing the wonders supposed to have been wrought by the statues and
idols they saw during their travels, especially by the marvellous
sandal-wood statue mentioned before (see p. 408).

The following tradition in regard to this image, narrated by Fa-hien
(Legge, 56, 57), is especially interesting as showing that the general
belief <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all classes of Buddhists in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> was, that Gautama

  the Vihara, this image immediately left its place, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> to

In Hiouen Thsang’s narrative, which is of <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> later date (see p. 413),
we find the following <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of this celebrated sandal-wood image
(Beal, ii. 322):—

  At the town of Pima (Pi-mo) there is a figure of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in a standing
  position <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of sandal-wood. The figure is about twenty feet high. It

  mostly obtain their wishes. This is what the natives say: ‘This image
  in <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> days, when <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was alive, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by Udayana, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of
  Kau?ambi (see p. 412 of these Lectures). When <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> left the world,
  it mounted of its own accord into the air, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the north of
  this kingdom to the town of Ho-lo-lo-kia (Urgha?).’

With regard to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> and character of the countless images now
scattered everywhere, they vary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to country and period (see p.
485). It should be observed, however, that Buddhism, when it began to
encourage idolatry, did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it hideous by giving monstrous shapes
to its idols. In this respect early Buddhism contrasted very favourably
with Hinduism. Nor did the Buddhists of India, as of other countries,
adopt the practice of endowing their idols with extra heads and arms to
symbolize power, or of inventing grotesque combinations of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>
figure with the shapes of elephants, birds, serpents, and other animals.
They seemed rather to have tried in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> instance to neutralize the

delineating their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teacher as an ideal man, simply and naturally

limbs, and a dignified, calm, passionless, and majestic bearing. What
can be a greater contrast than the four-armed elephant-headed
village-god of India,—Ga?e?a, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of ?iva[246]—and the purely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>
figure of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as shown in his statues!

Nevertheless it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be admitted that in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
representations of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> developed <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> peculiar varieties
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as differences in attitude. These differences, indeed,
constitute a highly interesting topic of inquiry, and perhaps deserve
more attention than they have hitherto received in any treatise with
which I am acquainted.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> going minutely into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> point, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> begin by noting a few
general characteristics common to all the Buddha’s images.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, they all represent Gautama as clothed—not naked. In
this respect they <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> a pleasant contrast to the images of Jaina
saints; for, as already pointed out, Gautama discountenanced all
extremes of bodily mortification, and disapproved the practice of going
about nude, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the custom of Hindu devotees. In the
Dharma-pada it is said, ‘Not nakedness, not matted hair, not dirt, not
fasting, nor lying on the ground, nor smearing with ashes, nor sitting
motionless can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.’

Gautama’s robe was drawn gracefully over his shoulders <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a toga, but
probably the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> shoulder was always left bare on formal occasions.
The Pi?akas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> no clear information as to this point. In Indian
statues the robe is sometimes represented as fitting so closely to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> that the figure seems garmentless[247]; its presence being merely
denoted by a line running diagonally over the left shoulder across the
breast, and under the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> arm. This line frequently looks so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a
cord that some have mistaken it for the thread to which, as a Kshatriya,
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was entitled[248]. In some ancient images no trace of the line is
left, but they are not really nude. Most Indian images have the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
shoulder bare (even in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of nuns). Of course in colder climates
both shoulders are covered. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> in Southern countries some have both
shoulders covered, or the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> partially so.

In contradistinction to the clothed images of the Buddha, all the
representations of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> opponent and rival Deva-datta (see pp. 52,
405) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the latter unclothed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a Jaina ascetic, or only partially
clothed up to the waist. Deva-datta is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> represented as shorter in
stature than the Buddha.

Other characteristics generally to be observed in the earlier images of
Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> are:—the impassive tranquil features, typical of complete
conquest over the passions, and of perfect repose; the absence of all
decoration and ornament; the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> pendulous ears, which occasionally
reach to the shoulders[249]; the circle or small globe or lotus[250], or
auspicious mark of some kind, on the palm or palms of the supinated
hands (as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as often on the soles of the feet), and the short knobby
hair, often carved so as to resemble a close-fitting curly wig.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be forgotten that Gautama signalized his renunciation of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by cutting off his hair with a sword, and the resulting stumps are
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have turned into permanent knobs or short curls[251].

In images <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Burma and Siam a curious horn-like protuberance
on the crown of the head—either tapering to a point, or rounded off at
the extremity—is noticeable. Often, too, sculptures <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in India show
the rounded <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of this excrescence.

Some think that it represents an ascetic’s mass of hair coiled up in a
top-knot on the crown of the head, as in images of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva. <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span>
regard it as the rough outline of what ought to be an Ush?isha or
peculiar crown-like head-dress, such as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> later images
of the Buddha. Some legends declare that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was born with this
Ush?isha, which was indicative of his future supremacy.

Others, again, maintain that this protuberance (sometimes lengthened out
so as to be as high as the head itself) was a peculiar growth of the
skull, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the marks of a supreme <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> indicative of
supernatural intelligence; just as in other images (especially those
<span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> from Ceylon) five flames—in shape <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the fingers of a hand—are
represented issuing from the crown of the head (see p. 453), to typify
the Buddha’s diffusion of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> throughout the world.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that this outgrowth of the Buddha’s skull has been preserved
as a sacred relic in a town of Afghanistan near Jalalabad.

In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> representations of the Buddha, a Nimbus or aureola of glory
encircles the head (see p. 478), and in some images rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> are
represented as emerging from his <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> body. An image with a halo of
this kind surrounding the entire figure was seen by me in a temple near
Kandy in Ceylon (see p. 453).

In Nepal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> images represent <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> holding his alms-bowl, but these
are not common in other places.

With regard to the size of the images, they vary from diminutive
examples, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> inches long, to colossal statues twelve,
eighteen, twenty, thirty, forty, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> seventy feet high. They are
generally carved in stone or marble, but sometimes in metal, sometimes
in wood, and occasionally moulded in clay.

<span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">Much</span> difference of opinion prevails as to the Buddha’s actual stature.
When I asked the opinion of Buddhist teachers in Ceylon, they all agreed
in assigning to the founder of their religion a majestic bodily frame,

than his fellow-men of those days, and was about eight feet high. It was
his opinion that as sin increases in the world, so men’s stature
decreases. Probably the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was tall, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> for the North-west of

[Illustration: SCULPTURE <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">FOUND</span> BY SIR A. CUNNINGHAM AT SARNATH, NEAR
BENARES,]

  Illustrating the four principal events in Gautama Buddha’s life—his
  birth from his mother’s side, his attainment of Buddhahood under the
    tree, his teaching at Benares, and his passing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in complete

the body. Images which represent a figure sitting in European fashion
are rare.

Four principal images represent the four principal events in Buddha’s
life, as shown in the Sarnath sculpture engraved on the opposite page
(compare p. 387).

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sedent attitude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Meditative.’ The example
below is described at p. xxx. 15.

This represents the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> seated, in meditation, on a raised seat under
the sacred tree, with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hands supinated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> over the other.

The second sedent attitude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Witness-attitude.’ It is
perhaps the most esteemed of all, and is represented in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sculpture

This represents Gautama at the moment of achieving Buddhahood after his
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> course of meditation, seated on a lion-throne (si?hasana) with an
ornamental back, having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lions carved below (compare p. 394). His

aureola round his head and a mark—perhaps the caste-mark of a
Kshatriya—on his forehead, and an umbrella over the sacred tree. This
attitude is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> shown in the Sarnath sculpture (facing p. 477).

The tradition is that at the moment of his enlightenment Gautama was
taunted by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> being Mara with being unable to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> any proof or
sign of his Buddhahood. Thereupon Gautama pointed, not to <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> as a

to witness. Then a six-fold earthquake and other miraculous phenomena
followed[253].

At this time, too, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> being Mara sent his enchanting daughters (p.
34) to seduce the Buddha. This is shown in the engraving facing p. 477.

Thsang:—

  In the Vihara, was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> a beautiful figure of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in a sitting
  position, the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> foot uppermost, the left <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> resting, the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>

  appearance as when alive. The signs and marks of a <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> were
  perfectly drawn. The loving expression of his face was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> life. Now
  it happened that a ?rama?a, who was passing the night in the Vihara,
  had a dream, in which he saw a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> who said:—

  that when he was about to reach Buddhahood the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> Mara <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to tempt

This is commemorative of the legend that Gautama, when seated in
meditation after his attainment of Buddhahood, was sheltered from a
violent storm by the expanded hood of the Naga, or serpent-demon
Mucalinda (see p. 39), while the coils of the snake were wound round his
body, or gathered under him to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> a seat. Similarly the ascetic <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
of ?iva is often represented under a serpent-canopy.

however, are common in the south, and their prevalence there is not
difficult to <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for. Indeed, the connexion of Buddhism with the
serpent-worship of southern countries and with the Nagas of Hindu
mythology (see p. 220 of these Lectures), was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> inevitable result of
its readiness to graft popular superstitions on its own doctrines[254].

represents <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> with an aquiline nose. It has the five rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span>

attitude (as shown in the engraving opposite p. 477). It represents
Gautama with the thumb and finger of the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> touching the fingers

The sixth attitude also—as a rule—comes under the erect class, and is
often scarcely to be distinguished from the last. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
‘Benedictive’ attitude (A?irvada). <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> the engraving opposite p. 477.

It represents the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the act of pronouncing a benediction, the

This attitude is sometimes sedent. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> to this

figure with the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> upraised has a crown, and an ornamental head-dress;

represent him with a crown of any kind _after his attainment of
Buddhahood_, are comparatively modern and incorrect.

On the other hand, it is clear that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> ancient sculptures, when they

The seventh attitude <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the ‘Mendicant.’ This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> is a
standing figure, holding a round alms-bowl in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hand, and sometimes
screening it with the other (compare p. 40). Examples of this attitude
are rare. There are no real mendicants in Buddhism. No monk ever begs,
he only receives alms.

The eighth and last attitude is recumbent, and this is perhaps as
important as the second, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> not so common (see the uppermost figure
opposite to p. 477). It represents the moribund Gautama lying down on
his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> side, with his head turned towards the north, and his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
cheek resting on his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> hand, about to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> in the final

kind was seen by me in a temple near Colombo, and there is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
example of it in the Indian Institute at Oxford[256]. In some carvings
of the dying <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> a few attendants are represented, who hold
umbrella-like canopies over the recumbent figure, or bow down
reverentially before it. It has been asserted that this scene—as
commemorative of the grand consummation of the Buddha’s career through
countless existences—is held in as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> reverence by Buddhists as the
crucifixion is by Christians.

The representation of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in the act of being born is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in
sculptures and bas-reliefs, but is <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> as a separate image. It
represents him springing out of the side of his mother (note, p. 180).
This birth-scene is occasionally carved on temples. It is shown in the
lower <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the engraving (opposite page 477). The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma is seen
receiving the new-born child, while Indra stands on his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and the
mother’s sister (i.e. nurse, p. 24) is on her left.

Some representations of the Buddha, or of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> forms of the
Buddha—such as Amitabha—show a sedent figure emerging from a
lotus-blossom, or seated on a pedestal formed of lotus-leaves, this
flower symbolizing perfection.

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be forgotten that in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> country the images of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
are generally moulded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the type of countenance prevalent in
each country. Hence the contour and expression of face differ in Ceylon,
Burma, Siam, Tibet, Mongolia, China, and Japan, although as a rule the
features are calm, mild, meditative, and passionless.

In Burma the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are merry; hence the images sometimes have a twinkle
in the eye and smiling lips.

In China, again, examples sometimes occur of images which do not exhibit
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as the ideal of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has conquered his passions, but rather
with the figure and features of a self-indulgent libertine[257]; while
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> again portray him with a grim aspect.

We now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to the representations of other Buddhas, Bodhi-sattvas,
saints, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and goddesses.

Often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> other images are associated with that of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
himself.

And, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of all, his image was joined with the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> persons of
the earliest Triad (see p. 175), viz. Dharma (the Law) and Sa?gha (the
Monkhood). A sculpture, in a broken and imperfect condition,
representing this earliest Triad, and dating from the ninth to the tenth
century, was <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> at Buddha-Gaya. The image of Buddha, under an
umbrella-like tree, is in the centre; that of the Sa?gha is on his
right, with a full-blown lotus (p. 177, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> 2), and having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> leg
hanging down, while that of Dharma (a female) is on his left with a
half-blown lotus. A drawing of this (from Sir A. Cunningham’s
photograph) is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> below:—

In Nepal the image of Dharma is always that of a sedent female, who is
supposed to be an embodiment of supreme wisdom (prajña paramita), and
sometimes has four arms (see note, p. 178).

Next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the images of the Buddhas who preceded Gautama, especially
Ka?yapa Buddha, Kanaka-muni, and Kraku-cchanda. It is often mentioned
that the images of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> or other of these three, as of the Bodhi-sattvas,
are <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up side by side with that of Gautama.

Then, of course, there are the images of the five Dhyani-Buddhas.
Perhaps the commonest of these is that of Amitabha (see p. 203), but
images of Akshobhya and Ratna-sambhava are by no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> rare.

Then as to the Bodhi-sattvas, of whom Maitreya is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> and the only

records that he saw in Northern India a wooden image of Maitreya
Bodhi-sattva eighty cubits high, which on fast <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> emitted a brilliant
light. Offerings were constantly presented to it by the kings of
surrounding countries (Legge, 23).

Hiouen Thsang (Beal, i. 134) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> describes this image of Maitreya as
very dazzling, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> it was the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the Arhat Madhyantika, a
disciple of Ananda. He saw <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> image of Maitreya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of silver at
Buddha-Gaya, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of sandal-wood in Western India. The
latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> gave out a bright light. Probably these images were covered
with some kind of gilding.

In the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the images of Maitreya often represent him with both
hands raised, the fingers forming the lotus-shaped Mudra, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
yellow or gilded, and the hair short and curly.

Passing next to the images of the triad of mythical Bodhi-sattvas,
Mañju-?ri, Avalokite?vara, and Vajra-pa?i (p. 195), we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> gather from
what has been already stated (p. 196), that the interaction of Buddhism
and Hinduism affected both the mythology and imagery of both systems.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it does not appear that the images of the Bodhi-sattva Mañju-?ri
were ever unnaturally distorted. They are quite as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> and pleasant in
appearance as those of Gautama and Maitreya. In general Mañju-?ri
represented in a sedent attitude, with his left <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> holding a lotus,
and his <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> holding the sword of wisdom, with a shining blade to
dissipate the darkness of ignorance (see p. 201). His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> ought to be
yellow.

It was not till the introduction of the worship of Avalokite?vara that
the followers of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of endowing the figures of deified
saints with an extra number of heads and arms.

The process of Avalokite?vara’s (Padma-pa?i’s) <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and the
formation of his numerous heads by the Dhyani-Buddha Amitabha, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

  Bodhi-sattva by laying his hands <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, so that by virtue of this

  Padma-pa?i then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a solemn vow to rescue all the beings in hell
  from their pains, <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> to himself:—‘If I fail, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> my head split
  into a thousand pieces!’ After remaining absorbed in contemplation for
  some time, he proceeded to the various hells, expecting to find that
  the inhabitants, through the efficacy of his meditations, had ascended
  to the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. And this <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> he <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> they had done. But no
  sooner was their release accomplished than all the hells again became
  as full as ever, the places of the out-going tenants being supplied by
  an equal number of new-comers. This so astounded the unhappy
  Bodhi-sattva that his head instantly split into a thousand pieces.
  Then Amitabha, deeply moved by his son’s misfortune, hastened to his
  assistance, and formed the thousand pieces into ten heads.

Schlagintweit states, and I have myself observed, that Avalokite?vara’s
eleven heads are generally represented as forming a pyramid, and are
ranged in four rows. Each series of heads has a particular complexion.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> faces resting on the neck are white, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> above yellow,

of his <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> Amitabha at the top of all[258]—is red. In Japanese images
the heads are <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> smaller, and are arranged <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a crown, the centre of

The number of Avalokite?vara’s hands ought to amount to a thousand, and
he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘a thousand-eyed,’ as having the eye of wisdom on each
palm. Of course all these thousand arms and eyes <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be represented
in images. Still there is an idol in the British Museum which represents
him with about forty arms, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of which have the hands joined in an

A remarkable description of an image of Avalokite?vara seen by Sarat
Chandra Das (so recently as 1882) in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> temple at Lhassa occurs
in his ‘Narrative’ (which I here abridge):—

  Next to the image of Buddha, the most conspicuous figure was that of
  Chanrassig (i. e. the eleven-faced Avalokite?vara). The origin of this
  is ascribed to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Sron Tsan Gampo (p. 271 of this volume). Once the
  <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> heard a voice from heaven, <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> that if he constructed an image
  of Avalokite?vara of the size of his own person, all his desires <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
  be fulfilled.

  Thereupon he proceeded to do so, and the materials he used were a
  branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree, a portion of the Vajrasana, some soil
  from an oceanic island, some sand from the river Nairañjana, some pith
  of Go?irsha sandal-wood, a portion of the soil of the eight sacred
  places of ancient India, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> other rare articles pounded <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span>

  Buddhas and the host of Bodhi-sattvas, that by the merit of making
  that image, there <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be god-speed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> he had
  undertaken—namely, the diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet.

  The gods, Buddhas, saints, etc. filled the aerial space to listen to
  his prayer.

  The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> then ordered the Nepalese artist to hasten the completion of
  the image, and with a view of heightening its sanctity, obtained a
  sandal-wood image of Avalokite?vara from Ceylon and inserted it
  inside, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with the relics of the seven past Buddhas. When the
  <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> was finished, the artist said:—

  ‘Sire, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> this image, it has passed into
  self-grown existence.’ Then a current of lightning flashed <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> from
  its feet. Afterwards, the souls of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and his queen are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to
  have been absorbed into it, in consequence of which this image is
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘the five-absorbed self-sprung.’

It is recorded in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> tradition that a wonder-working image of
Avalokite?vara was <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> up in a monastery near Kabul, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> in
Magadha near the Ganges. Any worshipper who approached these idols in
devotion and faith were favoured with a personal vision of the saint.
The statues opened, and the Bodhi-sattva emerged in bright rays of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span>
(compare Koeppen, i. p. 499).

Originally, and still in Tibet, Avalokite?vara (otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Padma-pa?i) had only male attributes; but in China this deity (as we
have already mentioned at p. 200) is represented as a woman, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Kwan-yin (in Japan Kwan-non), with a thousand arms and a thousand eyes.
She has her principal seat in the island of Poo-too, on the coast of
China, which is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of pilgrimage.

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> images of Kwan-yin in the British Museum, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with sixteen
arms and the other with eight.

Images of the third mythical Bodhi-sattva—the fierce Vajra-pa?i,
‘holding a thunderbolt in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hand’—like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of ?iva—are almost as
common as those of the merciful and mild Avalokite?vara. He has been
described in a previous Lecture (p. 201).

In the Pitt-Rivers collection at Oxford there is an image of this
Bodhi-sattva engaged in combating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of evil. It is remarkable

With regard to the images of female deities we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> observe that Tara,

In a temple which I visited near Darjiling I saw the image of the

the altar, with the images of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> Ayushmat, or
the ‘Buddha of Life,’ on each side.

Sir R. Temple (Journal, p. 212) relates how in a chamber of a Sikkim
monastery there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> figures, the central of which, with a fair
complexion, was Amitabha, that on its <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> Gautama Buddha, and on its
left Gorakh-nath (see p. 193 of this volume).

In the monastery of Galdan (p. 441) Mr. Sarat Chandra Das saw the golden
image of Tsong Khapa (with his golden chain and his tooth and his
block-prints), along with the images of Amitabha, Gautama, Maitreya,
Bhairava (the awful defender of Buddhism), Yama ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of death,’ and
his terrific messengers.

immense number of others, and especially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the terrific goddess
Paldan (or Pandan) who is feared all over Tibet, Mongolia, and China, as
the greatest guardian deity of the Dalai and Tashi Lamas and of the
Buddhist Dharma. He <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> her shrine infested with mice, who are
believed to be metamorphosed monks.

At Sera (p. 442) he saw images of the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in his character of
‘demon-vanquisher,’ along with Maitreya (in silver), Avalokite?vara, the
six-armed Bhairava, the goddess Kali, Dolkar (= Tara, p. 271), the
Tantrik Vajra-varahi, the sixteen Sthaviras (pp. 48, 255), and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
variety of others.

At Radeng (p. 273) he saw a golden image of Milaraspa (p. 384).

In the monastery of Sam ye (p. 448) he saw images of the Indian Pa??its
who <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> Buddhism into Tibet, with a vast number of other images.

At Tashi Lunpo he saw golden images of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and Maitreya, besides
images of 1000 other Buddhas (p. 189), and the four guardians of the
quarters (p. 206).

At Yarlung he saw an image of Vairocana Buddha, besides images of the
sixteen Sthaviras, and a gigantic image of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the Nagas, and a
terrific representation of the demon Rava?a (of the Ramaya?a).

At Mindolling he saw fresco paintings of the six classes of beings (p.
122) inhabiting the six corresponding worlds. Of course delineations of
the Jatakas (p. 111) and pictures of all kinds were common in
monasteries and temples everywhere.

already mentioned (p. 271).

As an illustration of the monstrous superstition and idolatry prevalent
in modern Buddhist countries, I venture, in conclusion, to quote, with
abridgment, the following description of an idol seen by Miss Bird in
Japan (see her ‘Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,’ published by Mr. Murray):—

  protects him. A worshipper writes his petition on paper, or, better
  still, has it written for him by the priest, chews it to a pulp and
  spits it at the divinity. If, having been <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> aimed, it passes

  netting the prayer has probably been unheard.

  On the left there is a shrine with a screen, to which innumerable
  prayers have been tied. On the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> sits <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Buddha’s original

                             LECTURE XVII.
                           _Sacred Objects._


Next to the subject of images and idols comes that of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sacred
objects which Buddhists of all Schools—whether adherents of the
Hina-yana or Maha-yana systems—hold in veneration; for example, relics,
relic-receptacles or Stupas, foot-prints, trees, utensils, bells,
symbols, and animals.

The narratives of the Chinese travellers, frequently mentioned before,
teem with descriptions of such objects. Take, for instance, Fa-hien’s
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the district of Nagara, near Peshawar in Northern India
(Legge, 34-40), in which several sacred objects are stated to exist—such
as a fragment of Buddha’s skull, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his teeth, portions of his hair
and nails, his alms-bowl, his staff (contained in a wooden tube, so
heavy that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not lift it), his robe, and the
impression of his shadow. This was at the beginning of the fifth century
of our era.

Fa-hien’s statements are confirmed by Sung-Yun, the next Chinese
traveller mentioned before (p. 161 of this volume[259]), who started on
his journey rather more than a century after Fa-hien.

  We then visited the Ki-Ka-lam temple near Nagara. This contains the
  yellow robe (Kashaya) of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> in thirteen pieces. Here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> is the
  staff of Buddha, in a wooden <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> covered with gold-leaf. The weight
  of this staff is sometimes so heavy that a hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> raise
  it, and at other times it is so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> can lift it. In the
  <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Na-kie (Nagarahara) is a tooth of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> some of his
  hair, both of which are contained in precious caskets. Morning and
  evening religious offerings are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to them.

  We next arrive at the cave of Go-pala, where is the shadow of Buddha.
  To anyone entering the cavern, and looking for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> (or, from a
  <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> distance) at the western side of it opposite the door, the
  figure, with its characteristic marks, appears; on going nearer, it
  gradually grows fainter and then disappears. On touching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
  where it was, there is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but the bare wall. Gradually
  retreating, the figure begins to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> in view again, and foremost is
  conspicuous that peculiar mark between the eyebrows (ur?a), which is
  so rare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> men.

  Before the cave is a square stone, on which is a trace of Buddha’s
  foot (Beal’s Translation, p. cvii, abridged).

Hiouen Thsang, the third traveller, confirms the statements of his
predecessors in regard to the relics in this district, and adds as
follows:—

  There is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> little Stupa, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of the seven precious substances,
  in which is deposited the _eye-ball_ of the Buddha, large as an Amra
  fruit, and bright and clear throughout. It is deposited in a sealed-up
  casket (Beal, i. 96).

It is easy to perceive from the above extracts that the worship of
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> sacred objects connected with the founder of Buddhism had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in Fa-hien’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a marked feature of Buddhism. In fact, the number
of such objects increased so rapidly that before <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> it became usual to
classify them under <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> heads as follow[260]:—

(1) ?aririka (or ?arira-dhatu or simply ?arira), objects which once
formed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Buddha’s body, such as a bone, a tooth, a hair, a
nail.

(2) Paribhogika, ‘objects possessed or used by the Buddha,’ such as his
seat, alms-bowl, drinking-vessel (kumbha), staff, vestments, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
his spittoon. Under this division is placed the Bodhi-tree.

(3) Udde?ika, objects worshipped as in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> commemorative of the

_sacred books_ containing the Buddha’s <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> are to be placed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

they were intelligent and omniscient beings. They are wrapped in costly
cloth or silk, and their names are mentioned with the addition of
honorific personal titles. Occasionally such sacred books are placed on
a kind of rude altar, near the road-side, that passers-by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>

we proceed to notice some of the chief objects in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of their
importance, beginning with relics.


                               _Relics._

Adoration of relics constitutes an important point of difference between
Buddhism and Brahmanism; for Brahmanism and its offspring Hinduism are
wholly opposed to the practice of preserving the ashes, bones, hair, or
teeth of deceased persons, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> such individuals <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been
revered during life.

I remarked in the course of my travels through India that articles used
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious teachers—as, for example, robes, wooden shoes, and
seats—are sometimes preserved and venerated after their death. All
articles of this kind, however, must, of course, be removed from the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> before actual decease; for it is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that, in the minds of
Hindus, ideas of impurity are inseparably connected with death, and
contamination is supposed to result from contact with the corpses of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a man’s dearest relatives. Nor is the mortal frame ever held in
veneration by the Hindus as it was by the ancient Egyptians, and as it
generally is in Christian countries.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is regarded as a mass of corruption, a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> to be
held in contempt, and a constant impediment to sanctity of life. How
<span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more then ought <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of a dead <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to be got rid of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

generally scattered on the surface of sacred rivers or of the sea.

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the bodies of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hindu ascetics and devotees are
exempted from this rule. They are usually buried—not burnt. Not,
however, because the mere corporeal frame is held in greater veneration,
but because the bodies of the most eminent saints are supposed to lie
undecomposed in a kind of trance, or state of intense ecstatic
meditation (samadhi).

The Buddhist, too, is a thorough Hindu in contemning the living body;
but when the corpse is burnt, he does not scatter the ashes on rivers.
He takes measures to preserve them.

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the teaching of Brahmanism the burning of a

Hiouen Thsang (Beal, ii. 40) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> states that when <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Indian Rajas,
eight in number, heard of the Buddha’s death, they collected armies and
marched to Kusi-nara (p. 424) to seize portions of the relics; but the
prince of Kusi-nara refused to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> them up. In the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> the matter was
settled amicably, and the relics were divided, so that each of the eight

each prince built a Stupa over his own portion of the relics. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>

Fa-hien (chap. xxiii) alludes to the building of the eight Stupas, and
adds that <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> A?oka destroyed them, and in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> built 84,000

consist of that number of elementary particles (see p. 423). The
eight-fold division is described in ‘Buddhist Suttas,’ pp. 133-136 (S.

that they gave <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> on special occasions celestial light, and had the

shrine which contained the relics was believed to be sufficiently
efficacious in stimulating their miraculous powers. Sometimes they were
taken out and exhibited. The following extract from Fa-hien reminds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

  In the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of He-lo (the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> Hi??a, west of Peshawar) there is
  the flat-bone of Buddha’s skull, deposited in a Vihara adorned all
  over with gold-leaf and the seven sacred substances. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the
  country revering the bone, and anxious lest it should be stolen, has
  selected eight individuals representing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> families, and committed
  to each a seal with which he should seal the shrine and guard the
  relic. At early dawn these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> come, and after each has inspected his
  seal, they open the door. This done they wash their hands with scented
  water, and <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> out the bone, which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on a lofty platform,

Then they replace
  the bone in the Vihara, under a Stupa of the seven precious substances
  (p. 528 of this volume) more than five cubits high (Legge, pp. 36-38,
  abridged).

Fa-hien records a similar exhibition of the Buddha’s alms-bowl in the
country near Peshawar:—

  When it is mid-day they <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> out the bowl and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> offerings to it.
  It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> contain about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> pecks, and it has a bright lustre. When poor

  in myriads of flowers, they are not able to fill it.

He states that the Buddha’s robe was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> out to be worshipped:—

  When there is a drought the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> collect in crowds, <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> out the
  robe, pay worship to it and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> offerings, on which there is
  immediately a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rain from the sky (Legge, pp. 35, 39, abridged).

The relics of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> saints in Buddhist countries were revered in a
similar manner. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it ought to be noted that the
periodical exhibition of relics, before the eyes of worshippers, was not
a usual occurrence (as it is in Roman Catholic countries). Indeed, as a
general rule, the custom seems to have been to shield the ashes and
remains of revered dead bodies from observation and liability to be
touched. Hence they were commonly sealed up hermetically, as it were, in
the interior of receptacles which effectually concealed them from view
and protected them from disturbance.

And this leads us to advert to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> and character of Buddhist
relic-receptacles.

It is probable that at a very early period, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> before the Buddha’s
time, the Hindus were accustomed to raise heaps or tumuli over the ashes
of kings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men, saints and sages, just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>
the Sikhs of the Panjab, the ashes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are so honoured. Some
think that the hemispherical dome-like <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of the tumulus was intended
to represent a bubble—the most transitory of all material objects. In
all likelihood the dome of the Sañchi Stupa—which is <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> to be as
<span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Buddha—was constructed in memory of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> man.

Such heaps were at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> generally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Caityas, and afterwards Stupas
(from the Sansk?it roots ci and styai, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> ‘to heap together’); but
Caitya ultimately denoted a relic-structure in an assembly-hall (see p.
450), while the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Stupa denoted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in the open air. Then inside the
Caitya or Stupa (Pali Thupa, corrupted into Tope) there was a
casket—made of silver, gold, stone, earthenware, etc.—in which were
deposited the ashes, fragments of bone, or the teeth or nails of the
deceased. And this relic-casket was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in Sansk?it Dhatu-garbha, or
in Pali Dagaba (corrupted into Dagoba and afterwards into Pagoda)—that
is, a repository of the elementary particles of which all bodies are
composed.

Then in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Dagaba (Pagoda) denoted the monument as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
the relic-casket. Moreover Caityas and Stupas were often mere pyramidal
structures, enshrining images or marking important events (see p. 390),
but not containing relics. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the Hindus Caitya often denotes the
sacred village-tree planted on a mound.

[Illustration: VOTIVE STUPA, RECENTLY <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">FOUND</span> AT BUDDHA-GAYA.]

            (Date about ninth or tenth century of our era.)

The process by which the simple Caitya or mound developed into more
elaborate structures is remarkable. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> erections of stone or
brick, generally bell-shaped or domed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> bee-hives. These again
expanded into elongated pyramidal structures, springing from cylindrical
or octagonal or hexagonal bases, and ornamented with images of Gautama,
and resting on plinth-like foundations, the summits tapering into
finials consisting of three, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
fifteen tiers of umbrella-shaped ornaments (see note, p. 393).

Then, again, in time, these elaborate Dagabas expanded into vast Pagodas
of enormous height, as, for example, the Rangoon Pagoda (see p. 456) and
that at Anuradha-pura in Ceylon.

It is doubtful whether in early Buddhism Caityas and Stupas were ever
empty monuments or cenotaphs. Probably all of them contained ashes,
fragments of bone, teeth, or hair, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in some cases the most careful
examination has failed to discover the vessel in which they were
deposited. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> of fragile materials, it rapidly crumbled into dust.
But Stupas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> relics, were themselves objects of reverence.

In the later period of Buddhism the practice of carving, or moulding
mere memorial or votive Stupas, and dedicating them at sacred spots
became common. The examples of this kind of Stupa which I saw unearthed
at Buddha-Gaya have been described (p. 397).

The engraving opposite to this page is a copy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of these votive
Stupas which I procured for the Indian Institute through Mr. Beglar.

At Mandalay there is a large Pagoda with about 620 smaller ones round it
(in rows of six or seven deep). Each small Pagoda enshrines a
tablet—exposed to view—on which some portion of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> is engraved.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> small Pagodas are simply canopies of brick or some solid material
erected over images.

Outside the Buddhist convent near Darjiling, when I visited it in 1884,
a monk was roughly moulding a number of small votive Stupas in clay,
with which he was probably mixing the powdered bones of some deceased
Lama. Here is a copy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> exactly the size of the original:—

[Illustration: ]

If broken open, a terra-cotta seal, inscribed with some sacred formula,

Of course most of the Buddha’s chief disciples, such as Sariputta,
Maudgalyayana, Ka?yapa, Ananda, Upali, each had Stupas erected over
their relics.


                         _Sacred Foot-prints._

Next in importance to the worship of relics is that of foot-prints
(Sansk?it ?ri-pada or ?ri-pada). Everywhere throughout Buddhist
countries the supposed impressions of the Buddha’s feet are as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
honoured as those of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u are by Vaish?avas.

When Fa-hien reached G?idhra-ku?a (see pp. 404, 406), he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have
used <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the following effect: ‘I, Fa-hien, was born when I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
not meet with Buddha, and now I only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the foot-prints which he has
left’ (Legge, 83).

It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that the practice of bowing down and honouring the feet
is a thoroughly Asiatic custom. The idea seems to be derived from a kind
of _a fortiori_ argument. If the feet, as the lowest member of the body,
are honoured, how <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more is homage rendered to the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> man. Hence

several worshippers kissing the feet of the image, while others—too

Paduka ‘shoes,’ but are really the supposed impressions of the soles of
the feet of the person to whom the shrines are dedicated. In 1876 I
visited the celebrated Vish?u-pad temple at Gaya. Crowds were
worshipping the foot-mark impressed on the bare stone, but concealed by
offerings, and surrounded by a silver fence under a silver canopy (see
‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 309).

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that Buddhists <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> imitate the practice of the worshippers
of Vish?u by marking their foreheads with the supposed impressions of
the Buddha’s feet, but they will nevertheless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and toilsome
pilgrimages to bow down before what they believe to be the impression of
his foot on a rock.

The Jainas, who are the only Hindu representatives of the Buddhistic
system left in India, are quite as ardent foot-print worshippers. In
1884 I ascended Mount Parasnath (Par?va-nath) in Bengal at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
with crowds of Jaina pilgrims who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> myself, toiled up the hill to
visit the numerous Jaina temples scattered over the uneven surface at
the summit, some five thousand feet above the plain. Our objects were
very different. Theirs was the acquisition of merit, mine was the
acquirement of knowledge. Lepers lined the rough pathway, and <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
additional merit was held to accrue to the pilgrims by distributing alms
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> them. I <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> shrine at the summit consisted of
a little domed canopy of marble, covering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
the twenty-four Jaina saints (especially Par?va-nath) impressed on a
marble altar. The soles of the supposed foot-prints were either white or
black and marked with small gilded circles.

Groups of worshippers bowed down before the shrines and deposited
offerings of money, rice, almonds, raisins, and spices on the
foot-marks. No sooner did they quit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> shrine for the next, than a
troop of frolicking monkeys promptly took their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and scampered off
with the edible portion of the objects offered.

It is impossible to state positively when either Buddhism or Jainism
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> introduced foot-print worship, but the practice <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have begun
very early.

With regard to this point General Sir A. Cunningham, in his <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of
the Bharhut Stupa—a Stupa which dates from the second century
B.C.—says:—

  Foot-prints of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> were most probably an object of reverence from a
  very early period—certainly before the building of the Bharhut
  Stupa—as they are represented in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> separate sculptures there. In the
  <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> sculpture the foot-prints are placed on a throne or altar,
  canopied by an umbrella, hung with garlands. A royal personage is
  kneeling before the altar, and reverently touching the foot-prints
  with his hands. The second example is in the bas-relief representing
  the visit of Ajata-?atru to Buddha. Here, as in all other Bharhut
  sculptures, <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> does not appear in person, his presence being
  marked by his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints. The wheel symbol is duly marked on both
  (p. 112, abridged).

The General justly remarks that perhaps the worship of the Buddha’s
foot-prints <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have sprung up in imitation of the homage alleged to
have been paid by Maha-Ka?yapa and 500 monks to his feet, which, it is
said, were exposed to view when his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was lying on the funeral pile.
The legend states that while the monks were in the act of bowing down in
adoration before the feet, the funeral pile ignited spontaneously.

On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the gate-pillars of the ancient Sañchi Stupa there is a
sculpture of a foot-print marked with the wheel (Cakra, p. 522) symbol,
which the late Mr. Fergusson ascribed to the early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
century of the Christian era.

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> sculptured representations of the Buddha’s foot-prints at
Amaravati, supposed to date from the second or third century of the
Christian era. These representations are often carved on so-called
altars or else placed before altars.

But of all foot-prints, that on Adam’s Peak (the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> mountain in
Ceylon, more than 7000 feet above the sea), supposed to have been left
by the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> when he ascended thence to heaven, is the most celebrated.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Fa-hien (Legge, p. 102), when <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was in Ceylon he
planted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> foot on the north of the royal <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> and the other on
Sumana-Ku?a (Adam’s Peak), fifteen yojanas, or about a hundred miles,
distant.

This fancied impression of the Buddha’s foot (believed by Christians to
be that of St. Thomas, by Muhammadans to be that of Adam, and by Hindus
to be that of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> ?iva) is merely a shapeless hollow in the rock,

been discovered by a hunter at the beginning of the century before
Christ, and, although very difficult of access, is annually visited by
about 100,000 Buddhist pilgrims. Near it, on the summit of the mountain,
is a small temple dedicated to Saman (p. 217).

In a shrine near the tooth-temple at Kandy, I saw a so-called facsimile
of this foot-print. Those who are physically incapable of toiling up the
mountain to bow down before the sacred impression on the rock, gain
nearly as <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> merit by worshipping its copy. The shrine was filled with
fragrant flowers recently deposited on the facsimile.

Other foot-prints in various places throughout India, Burma, Siam,
Tibet, Mongolia, and China, are from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> to five feet long. A tradition
is mentioned by Fa-hien (Legge, 29) that, when <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> visited Northern
India, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the country of Woo-chang or Udyana, and there he left
a print of his foot, which appears <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> or short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the ideas

                            _Sacred Trees._

We now <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to a brief consideration of sacred trees. Most persons
are aware that the homage offered to trees and plants is not confined to
Buddhism. It existed very early in Brahmanism and is still common
everywhere throughout India (see my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 330).

In point of fact various forms of tree-worship prevail at the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span>
moment in almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> where superstition and
ignorance are ruling influences. Nor can we really condemn, as either
unnatural or unreasonable, the feeling of veneration with which trees
are generally regarded, bearing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> the grateful shade and shelter
which they afford, the beauty of their foliage, their importance as
purifiers of the atmosphere, and the hundreds of useful purposes to
which their wood, leaves, and fruit are applicable. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Dr. E.
B. Tylor (‘Primitive Culture,’ ii. 223), the North American Indians of
the <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">Far</span> West often hang offerings on the trees to propitiate the spirits
and procure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> weather and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> hunting. He adds that Mr. Darwin
describes the South Americans as doing <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> the same.

In Persia and other Eastern Countries trees <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> often be met with, the
branches of which have been recently hung with offerings of cloth, rags,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> garments.

In India the notion of trees being inhabited by deities or semi-divine
beings or spirits is to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> very common, and we have already noted
(p. 112) that during the period of Gautama’s Bodhi-sattvaship, in the
course of which he had to undergo countless births in preparation for
his Buddhahood, he was born forty-three times as a tree-god.

In Siam, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Mr. Alabaster, offerings are commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> in the

various votive objects on the branches, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them on a stand or

Moreover they are very averse to the cutting down of any trees of any
kind, lest the tree-gods should be angry.

  ‘Some <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago,’ <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> Mr. Alabaster, ‘when I employed my spare energy
  in showing the Siamese how to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> roads in the, till then, roadless
  suburbs of Bangkok, I had to cut my lines through villages,
  temple-groves, orchards, plantations, and patches of jungle. For the
  “wicked” duty of cutting down the trees, a gang of the lowest
  criminals was placed at my disposal.’ But he adds that the removal of
  any specially <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> building or tree was interdicted by the Government.

We have already seen that, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the theory of later Buddhism,

For example, there is the Pippala (also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> A?vattha, _Ficus

Kanaka-muni; the ?irisha (_Acacia Serisa_) of Kraku-Cchanda; the ?ala
(_Shorea Robusta_) of Vi?va-bhu; the Pu??arika (_White_ _Lotus_) of
?ikhin[267]; the Pa?ali (_Bignonia Suaveolens_) of Vipa?yin.

These six Buddhas with Gautama are sometimes held to be the seven
principal Buddhas, and, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to some authorities, the tree of the
future <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (Maitreya) will be the Iron-wood tree (Sideroxylon)[268].
Specimens of some of these trees are to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> growing in the area of
the Buddha-Gaya temple, and several are represented in the sculptures of
the Stupa of Bharhut (of the second century B.C.). On <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the pillars

A?vattha or Pippala (Pipal), under which Gautama achieved Buddhahood and

supposed original tree at Buddha-Gaya.

A tradition relates that Gautama during his lifetime directed Ananda to
break off a branch from that original tree and to plant it in the garden
of the Vihara, or monastery, at ?ravasti—Gautama’s favourite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of

reward as if he worshipped me[270].’

This is a mere legend resting on no historical basis; but the tradition
which makes Gautama choose a seat under the sacred Pippala or A?vattha
as the spot where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> stirrings of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> afflatus and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

quivering and rustling of its leaves—were likely to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> themselves
felt, points to a probable fact—a fact quite in harmony with what we
have already noted in regard to his early Brahmanical education and
ideas. We read in the Ka?ha Upanishad (VI. 1) that the root of the
A?vattha-tree was identified with the Supreme Being, Brahman. In a
passage of the Mu??aka Upanishad (III. 1. 1) and in a Mantra of the
?ig-veda (I. 164. 20) the same idea is alluded to. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that
Gautama afterwards repudiated the possibility of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inspiration
coming from any external source whatever, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is probable that when

supernatural communications of some kind[271].

The history of the original sacred Pippala (A?vattha) tree, or as it is
commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Bodhi-tree (Bo-tree) of Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> at
Buddha-Gaya, has already been sketched in a previous Lecture (see pp.
392-394).

Hiouen Thsang’s description of the tree, as he saw it in the seventh
century, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> been <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> (see p. 399). Fa-hien, who saw it at
Buddha-Gaya in the fifth century, calls it the Patra-tree. The following
is an abridgement of what he <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> about it:—

  The Bodhi-sattva advanced to the Patra-tree, placed the Ku?a grass at
  the foot of it, and sat down with his face to the east. Then <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Mara
  sent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> beautiful damsels to tempt him. The Bodhi-sattva <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> his
  toes down to the ground, and the young maidens were changed into <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span>
  grandmothers. Buddha, after attaining perfect wisdom, contemplated the
  tree for seven <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> (Legge, p. 88).

Fa-hien <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> saw the offspring of the original Bodhi-tree growing in
Ceylon (Legge, p. 103).

It is recorded that soon after Mahinda, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of A?oka, arrived in Ceylon
(about 250 B.C.) for the purpose of propagating Buddhism, his sister,
who had <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Buddhist Nun, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> arrived there, and <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> with her
from <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> A?oka a branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree of Buddha-Gaya. This
was planted at Anuradha-pura, and the zealous Buddhists of Ceylon fully
believe that the identical tree exists there still.

An interesting <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the state of this tree or its descendant,
about thirty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in Sir Emerson Tennant’s ‘Ceylon’ (vol.
ii. p. 613). I here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> an abridged extract:—

  The Bo-tree of Anuradha-pura is in all probability the oldest
  historical tree in the world. Its conservancy has been an object of
  solicitude to successive dynasties, and the story of its vicissitudes
  has been preserved in a series of continuous chronicles.

  It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> almost seem to verify the prophecy pronounced when it was
  planted, that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> flourish and be green for ever.

  The degree of sanctity with which this extraordinary tree has been
  invested by Buddhists, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be compared to the feeling of veneration
  with which Christians regard the attested wood of the Cross.

  The other Bo-trees which are <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in the vicinity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> temple in
  Ceylon are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be all derived from the parent-tree at
  Anuradha-pura, but they have been propagated by seeds; the priesthood
  adhering in this respect to the precedent recorded in the Maha-va??a
  (when Mahinda himself, taking up a fruit as it fell, gave it to the
  <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> to plant), and objecting religiously to lop it with any weapon.

  In the fifth century Fa-hien <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the Bo-tree at Anuradha-pura in
  vigorous health, and its guardians displaying towards it the same
  vigilant tenderness which they exhibit at the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day.

  The author of the Maha-va??a, who wrote between the <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> 459 and 478
  of our era, after relating the ceremonial which had been observed
  nearly eight hundred <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before, at the planting of the venerated
  tree by Mahinda, concludes by saying:—‘Thus this monarch of the
  forest, endowed with miraculous powers, has stood for ages in La?ka,
  promoting the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> welfare of its inhabitants and the propagation
  of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> religion.’

When Buddhism became thoroughly mixed up with Hinduism the Kalpa-tree or
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> tree of Indra’s paradise was often introduced. It is supposed to
have its terrestrial counterpart in some sacred spots on earth, and
there to grant all desires, the worshipper having merely to stretch out
his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the gifts suspended from its branches[272]. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
sculpture it is represented pouring out coins on the ground. This kind
of wishing-tree is believed to present, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> other things, any food
that its worshippers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> ask for, and to <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> it ready-cooked, if
cooking is needed.

The miraculous tree which developed out of the Buddha’s tooth-cleaning
twig, when thrown by him on the ground, has been already described (see
p. 419, and compare ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 337).


                           _Sacred Symbols._

Some of the sacred objects already described <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be regarded as symbols.
Of those which are more strictly symbols the _Tri-ratna_ ‘three-jewel’
emblem comes first. It is three-pointed, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> points are simply
emblematical of the Buddha, the Law, and the Monastic Order. It is often
used as an ornament. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> examples <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen in some of the Bharhut
sculptures (see Sir A. Cunningham’s work). The central point is often
the least elevated.

The use of this triple symbol is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> proof of the connexion between
Buddhism and Hinduism. Both delight in triads and in symbolizing
triads[273], but the Buddhist ‘three-jewel’ symbol should not be
confused with the Hindu Tri-?ula, which is ?iva’s trident used as a
weapon in his warfare with the demons. The Tri-ratna is merely the
analogue of the Tri-?ula, as it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of the triple horizontal mark on
the forehead of ?aivas, and of the Tri-pu??ra or triple frontal mark of
the Tengalai sect of Ramanuja Vaish?avas. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> outer marks of the
latter stand for Vish?u’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> feet and the middle for his consort
Lakshmi[274].

Sir A. Cunningham was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to show that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fetish-like
figures of Jagannath (K?ish?a) and his sister and brother, at Puri in
Orissa, were derived from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the combined emblems of the Buddhist
Tri-ratna (compare p. 166 of this volume).

Next to the Tri-ratna comes the _Cakra_ or wheel. This symbolizes the
Buddhist doctrine that the origin of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and of the universe (p. 119)
are unknowable—the doctrine of a circle of causes and effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
beginning and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> end. The wheel <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> typifies the rolling of this
doctrine over the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (pp. 410, 423). It is
perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most important symbols of Buddhist philosophy. It is
often represented as either supporting the Tri-ratna or supported by it,
or the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be inserted in it.

Observe that the Cakra or wheel is equally a Vaish?ava symbol, but in
the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of Vish?u or of K?ish?a it is a circular weapon, hurled at a
demon-foe.

The Wheel, the Tri-ratna, and the Lotus are so important, as symbols of
Buddhism, that they are combined in the vignette on the title-page of
this volume.

the periphery of the circle. In my opinion, the four spokes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

object of adoration in itself.

I need scarcely revert to the _Umbrella_ symbol (see p. 393). In Eastern
countries it typifies supremacy. If a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> is <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> else ought

The _?a?kha_ or _Conch-shell_ is a very auspicious symbol, especially if

                           _Sacred Animals._

It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be truly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that all animals are more or less venerated—though
not actually worshipped—under the Buddhist system. How can it be
otherwise when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Buddhist believes that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself was
incarnated in various animals during the period of his Bodhi-sattvaship
(see p. 111)?

In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Hindus believe that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Vish?u was incarnated in
animals, such as a fish, a tortoise, and a boar.

Buddhism in this as in other respects is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Brahmanism and Hinduism.
The feeling of reverence for animals rests on the doctrine of
metempsychosis. It is difficult for either a Hindu or a Buddhist to draw
a line of demarcation between gods, men, and animals, when the same
living being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> exist as a god, a man, or an animal. It is on this
<span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> that in India animals appear to live on terms of the greatest
friendship and mutual confidence with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings.

  Everywhere in India animals dispute possession of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with man.
  Birds build their nests and lay their eggs in the fields, untroubled
  by fears or misgivings, before the very eyes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> passer-by, and

  soil as if they were the landlords. Bulls walk about independently in
  the streets, and jostle you on the pavements; monkeys domesticate
  themselves jauntily on the roof of your house; parrots peer
  inquisitively from the eaves of your bedroom into the mysteries of
  your toilet; crows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> themselves at home on your window-sill, and
  carry off impudently any portable article of jewellery that takes

Perhaps the most sacred animal in the estimation of all Buddhists is the
elephant. This will be easily understood by recalling what has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
in a previous Lecture (see pp. 23, 24). In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the Bharhut sculptures
the white elephant is seen descending to enter the side of Gautama’s
mother Maya (‘Stupa of Bharhut,’ p. 84). The elephant, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> Sir A.
Cunningham, is a favourite subject for delineation. It is represented in
almost <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> possible position, as standing, walking, running, sitting
down, eating, drinking, throwing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> over its own back, and lastly,
kneeling down in reverence before the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Bodhi-tree.

Probably the next sacred animal to the elephant is the deer. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
was born eleven times as a deer (p. 111), and he delivered his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

Sir A. Cunningham remarks:—

  The animals represented in the Bharhut sculptures are of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> classes,

The quadrupeds
  include the lion, elephant, horse, rhinoceros, wild boar, bull, deer,

them.

The real use of bells in Burmese temples is to draw the attention of the
deities and spirits (Naths) to the act of worship, and so secure the due
registering of prayer-merit. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has finished his repetitions, he
strikes the bell with a piece of wood or other sacred implement lying
near, and the more noise he makes the better. Mr. Scott informs us that
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> large pagoda has dozens of bells of all sizes, hanging outside,

They are constantly dedicated
by religious people, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> multiplied _ad infinitum_.

The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of dedication is inscribed on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> bell, and is in the Pali

The following is a portion of a remarkable inscription in the vernacular
(Shway Yoe, i. 243, abridged):—

  This bell was moulded with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> care and <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> expense, and is humbly

The weight of the bell is generally added to the dedication.

There is a fine Burmese bell in the Indian section of the South
Kensington Museum. It has a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> Pali inscription, a portion of the
translation of which I here give:—

  ‘Without charity you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> attain to Nirva?a’—so it is written in the
  Pali Texts.

  I, the giver of this bell, was staying in the sweet-smelling town of
  Ma-oo—of which I collect the taxes for the king—and with me was my
  wife—my life’s breath—like to the pollen of a lily, from whom I will
  not be separated in all the existences which are to come, and out of
  which we hope soon to escape. We adore Buddha, that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> embark in
  the golden raft of the Noble Path, which will lead us to the final
  plunge into Nirva?a. We two, brother and sister (that is, husband and
  wife), have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> this bell as an offering. The exact weight of the
  bell is 2500 kyats. We took our own weight in gold and silver and
  bright copper and other metal, and mixed them <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> together, in the
  year 1209 (1847 A.D.).

  Now I will record all the alms I gave and what I erected <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
  sacred enclosure. I gave a sacred flag-staff (see p. 380 of these
  Lectures), the price of which, with all expenses in putting up, was
  500 rupees. At the foot of it I built four small pagodas. Outside I
  built a monastery and a rest-house. Such are all the offerings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">May</span> I

  All the merits I have gained, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> they be shared with my parents,

Under the head of miscellaneous objects, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> the seven precious
minerals or substances to which allusion has frequently been made. They
are gold, silver, pearl, sapphire or ruby, cat’s eye, diamond, and coral
(Childers); but they vary, and some authorities substitute lapis lazuli
for pearl. In Hinduism there are nine precious substances (nava-ratna).

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> enumerate here the seven treasures belonging to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

_Supplementary Remarks on the Connexion of Buddhism with Jainism[276]._


Having during the progress of the foregoing Lectures, incidentally
mentioned the subject of Jainism, I ought not to conclude them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
explaining some of the chief points of difference between the system of
the Jainas (conveniently contracted into Jains) and that of the
Buddhists. The Jains in India, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their own reckoning, number
1,222,000; but this is incorrect, for by the last Census they only
number half a million. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> authority (Sir William Wilson Hunter)
confirms this. (See his ‘Gazetteer’ and ‘Indian Empire.’)

Most scholars in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are of opinion that the Jaina Teacher
Vardhamana Maha-vira (Nataputta) and Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> were contemporaries,
and that Jains were an independent sceptical sect, probably a little
antecedent to the Buddhists, and were their rivals. At any rate it seems
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that the Niga??has[277] or Dig-ambara Jains, that is, a sect of
naked ascetics, existed before the Buddha’s time, and that the Tripi?aka
alludes to them.

Probably Vardhamana Maha-vira (usually <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Maha-vira) was merely a
reformer of a system previously founded by a teacher named Par?va-natha.
Not <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> of the latter, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> he is greatly honoured by the
Jains. His images are ‘serpent-canopied’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> those of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> (p. 480).
His pupils are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Pasavaccijja (for Par?vapatyiya, ‘belonging to the
descendants of Par?va’). They were only bound by four vows, whereas
Maha-vira’s teaching imposed five vows.

We have seen that Gautama Buddha, in the fifth century B.C., <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the
conclusion that bodily austerities were useless as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of obtaining
liberation. His main idea seems to have been that liberation from the
painful cycle of continued re-births, that is, from Sa?sara, was to be
obtained by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (Bodhi), evolved out of the inner
consciousness through meditation (dhyana) and intuition; whereas, in
contradistinction to this Buddhist idea, the main idea of the Jain
teacher Maha-vira seems to have been that liberation was to be obtained
through subjugation of the passions and through mortification of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (tapas). The term Jina, ‘conqueror,’ is used in both systems, but
Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a Jina or conqueror through profound abstract
meditation, whereas Maha-vira was a Jina through severe bodily
austerity.

In fact, the Jains, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all other ascetics, were impressed with the
idea that it was necessary to maintain a defensive warfare against the
assault of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> passions, by keeping under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and subduing it.
They had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a notion that a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of shame implied sin, so that if
there were no sin in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no shame. Hence they
argued rather illogically that to get rid of clothes was to get rid of
sin; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> ascetic who aimed at sinlessness was enjoined to walk
about naked, with the air or sky (Dig) as his sole covering
(Dig-ambara).

In the Kalpa-sutra of the Jains we read that Maha-vira himself began his
career by wearing clothes for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> year and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> month, and after that he
walked about naked. Now Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was an opponent of Jain
asceticism, and it seems to me probable that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the chief points on
which he laid stress was that of decent clothing. In the Dhamma-pada
(141) occurs the sentiment that ‘Nakedness <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> purify a mortal who
has not overcome desires.’ And again, in the Sekhiya Dhamma we have
‘properly clad’ ‘must a monk itinerate.’ (See p. 473 of these Lectures.)

It is recorded in the Vinaya (Maha-vagga I. 6. 7-9) that Upaka, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of
the Ajivaka sect of naked ascetics, founded by Gosala (said to have been
a pupil of Maha-vira), met the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> just after his enlightenment, and
noticing his bright countenance, asked him who had been his teacher? He
replied, ‘Having gained all knowledge, I am myself the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> teacher.’
Thereupon the naked ascetic shook his head and <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> road.

Clearly these naked Niga??has, disciples of the Jain Teacher Maha-vira,
were no friends of the Buddha. It seems to me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> possible that
Gautama’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> rival, Deva-datta (see pp. 405, 406), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have belonged
to a Dig-ambara sect who opposed the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> on questions of stricter
asceticism, especially in the matter of clothing; for in ancient
sculptures Deva-datta is generally represented naked or nearly so, and
is usually in close proximity to his cousin Gautama Buddha, who, in
marked contrast to the other, is always clothed. Evidently the question
of dress was a crucial one, and in process of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> a party seems to have
arisen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the Dig-ambara Jains, opposed to strict asceticism in
this particular.

This party ultimately formed themselves into a separate sect, calling
themselves ?vetambaras, that is, ‘clothed in white garments.’ It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
<span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that in early Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> similar parties arose, the strict and
the lax. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Buddhist parties were ultimately reunited. The
second council is supposed to have settled the controversy.

Dr. Jacobi has shown that the separation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain sects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have
taken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (according to the traditions of both parties) some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> century of our era.

It appears probable that the strict Dig-ambaras preceded the more lax
?vetambaras, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> each sect claims to be the oldest. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain
sects have remained separate to the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in all essential
points of doctrine and discipline they agree.

When I was last in India, in 1884, I ascended the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hills, Parasnath
(for Par?va-nath) and Abu—both of them most sacred places in the
estimation of the Jains, and covered with their temples. My ascent of
the former has been already described (p. 509). I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> visited Delhi,
Jaypur, Ajmere, and some other chief Jain stations. Jaypur is the
stronghold of the Dig-ambara Jains, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> intelligent Dig-ambara
Pa??its, named Pha?e Lal and Syoji Lal, visited me there. We conversed
for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in Sansk?it, and I asked them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> questions about their
religion, and the points in which they differed from the ?vetambara
sect.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> chief differences were stated to be: First, the ?vetambaras object
to entirely nude images of any of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirtha?-karas
accepted by both sects. Hence all ?vetambara statues ought to have some
appearance of a line round the middle of the body, representing a strip
of cloth. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> respect the images of the Jinas differ from those of
the Buddhas. They have a jewel-like mark on the breast. This is
especially conspicuous in Par?va-nath. They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span>
colours, and have symbols (generally animals, such as a deer, tortoise,
pig) connected with them.

Secondly, the ?vetambaras admit women into their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of ascetics just
as Buddhists have their Bhikkhunis, or nuns; whereas the Dig-ambaras,
for obvious reasons, do not admit women.

Thirdly, the ?vetambaras have distinct sacred books of their own, which
they call A?gas, ‘limbs of the Law,’ eleven in number, besides others,
making 45 Agamas, 11 A?gas, 12 Upa?gas, 10 Painnas (Prakir?aka), 4
Mulas, 6 Chedas, 1 Anuyoga-dvara, and 1 Nandi. Dr. Bühler places the
composition of the A?gas in the third century B.C. Dr. Jacobi places
them at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the fourth or beginning of the third century. They
are written in Jain Prak?it (sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ardha-Magadhi, a later
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> than Pali), with Sansk?it commentaries. The Dig-ambaras substitute,
for the A?gas, later works, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> written in more modern Prak?it
(probably in the fifth or sixth century after Christ), and maintain that
the ?vetambara Canon is spurious. Both sects have valuable Sansk?it
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> in their sacred literature.

I now add a few characteristics of both sects of Jains as distinguishing
them from Buddhists.

I need scarcely notice the fact that the Jains of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> keep
up Caste. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Jain Pa??its who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to me at Jaypur were Brahmans,
and wore the Brahmanical thread. I believe this to be a mere modern
innovation, which does not properly belong to the Jain system.

More important are the following points:—The Jain saints, or prophets,
are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by a peculiar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Tirtha?-kara, ‘ford-makers,’ i. e. making
a ford across the troubled river of constant births or transmigrations
(Sa?sara) to the Elysium of Nirva?a; whereas the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Tirtha?-kara with
the Buddhists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> a ‘heretical teacher.’ Then there are twenty-four
Jain Tirtha?-karas, whereas there are twenty-five Buddhas. Of the
twenty-four Jain saints, the twenty-third and twenty-fourth—Par?va-nath
(pp. 509, 529) and Maha-vira—are the only historical personages. The
others, beginning with ?ishabha, are mythical.

Next, the Jains have no Stupas or Dagabas (p. 504) for preserving the
relics of their saints.

Still more important is the point that the Jains believe in separate
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> souls (Jiva), whereas the Buddhists deny the existence of
souls. Souls, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the Jains, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> exist in stocks, stones, lumps
of earth, drops of water, particles of fire. In Buddhism there is, as we
have seen, no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> metempsychosis, but rather a connected series of
metamorphoses, and this stops at animals; whereas the metempsychosis of
Jainism extends to inorganic matter.

With regard to the moral code <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> points <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be noticed. The
Jaina ‘three jewels’ are Right-belief, Right-knowledge, and
Right-conduct, whereas the Buddhist Tri-ratna consists in the well-known
Triad—the Buddha, the Law, and the Monkhood.

Then as to the five chief Moral Prohibitions—the fifth with Jains is:
‘have no worldly attachments;’ whereas with Buddhists it is: ‘drink no
strong drink.’ I believe the Buddhists to have been the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to
introduce total abstinence from strong drinks into India. The Jains,
too, lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more stress than the Buddhists on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
prohibition:—Kill no living creature. They strain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> before drinking,
sweep the ground with a silken brush before sitting down on it, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
eat in the dark, often wear muslin before their mouths to catch minute
insects, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> object to eating fruits containing seed.

<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Another</span> interesting difference is that Jainism makes Dharma and Adharma,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and evil, or rather merit and demerit, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> out of its six real
substances—its fundamental and eternal principles (Astikaya)—the other
four being matter (pudgala), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (jiva), space and time. The Jains
reject the Buddhist theory of the five Skandhas (see p. 109).

Lastly, the prayer-formula of the Jains differs from the well-known
‘three-refuge’ formula of the Buddhists (‘I go for refuge to the Buddha,
the Law, and the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> of Monks’) thus: ‘Reverence to the Arhats, to the
Siddhas, to the Acaryas, to the Upadhyayas, to all the Sadhus’ (Namo
Arihanta?a? namo Siddha?a? namo Ayariya?a? namo Uvajjhaya?a? namo loe
sabba-sahu?a?).

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> will not permit me to notice minor differences, such as the Jain
rule that the hair should be painfully torn off, instead of cut off,
etc.

Certainly Jainism, when viewed from the stand-point of Christianity, is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a colder system than Buddhism, and has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> less claim to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

                             LECTURE XVIII.
                _Buddhism contrasted with Christianity._


In the previous Lectures I have incidentally contrasted the principal
doctrines of Buddhism with those of Christianity.

It will be my aim in this concluding Lecture to draw attention more
directly and more in detail to the main points of divergence between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
systems, which in their moral teaching have so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> points of contact,
that a superficial study of either is apt to lead to very confused ideas

other.

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of all I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> remind those who heard my earlier Lectures of
the grand fundamental distinction which they were intended to
establish—namely, that Christianity is a religion, whereas Buddhism, at
least in its earliest and truest form, is no religion at all, but a mere
system of morality and philosophy founded on a pessimistic theory of
life.

Here, however, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be objected that, before we exclude Buddhism from
all title to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a religion, we ought to define what we mean by
the term ‘religion.’

Of course, it will be generally acknowledged that mere morality need not
imply religion, though—taking the converse—it is most undeniably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

Unquestionably there have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> philosophers in ancient times who

holiness, wisdom, power, and love, and intensified by a deep
consciousness of weakness, and a yearning to be delivered from the
presence, tyranny, and penalty of sin.

Then, starting from these assumptions, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> satisfy four requisites.

First, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> reveal the Creator in His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and attributes to His
creature, man.

Secondly, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> reveal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to himself. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> impart to him a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and history—what he is; why he was created;
whither he is tending; and whether he is at <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> in a state of
decadence downwards from a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> condition, or of development upwards
from a lower.

Thirdly, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> reveal some method by which the finite creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
communicate with the infinite Creator—some plan by which he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> gain
access to Him and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> united with Him, and be saved by Him from the
consequences of his own sinful acts.

Fourthly, such a system <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> prove its title to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a religion by
its regenerating effect on man’s nature; by its influence on his
thoughts, desires, passions, and feelings; by its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of subduing all
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> tendencies; by its ability to transform his character and
assimilate him to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> it reveals.

It is clear, then, that tried by such a criterion as this, early
Buddhism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not claim to be a religion. It failed to satisfy these
conditions. It refused to admit the existence of a personal Creator, or
of man’s dependence on a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Power. It denied any eternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Ego
in man. It acknowledged no external, supernatural revelation. It had no
priesthood—no real clergy; no real prayer; no real worship. It had no
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> idea of sin, or of the need of pardon (p. 124), and it condemned
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to suffer the consequences of his own sinful acts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hope of
help from any Saviour or Redeemer, and <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> from any being but
himself.

The late Bishop of Calcutta once <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to me, that being in an outlying

pious Buddhist, whom he happened to observe praying in a temple, what he
had just been praying for? He replied, ‘I have been praying for
nothing.’ ‘But,’ urged the Bishop, ‘to whom have you been praying?’ The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> answered, ‘I have been praying to nobody.’ ‘What!’ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the
astonished Bishop, ‘praying for <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> to nobody?’ And no doubt this
anecdote gives an accurate idea of the so-called prayer of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
Buddhist. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had not really been praying for anything. He had been
merely making use of some <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> to which an efficacy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that
of sowing fruitful seed in a field, was supposed to belong. He had not
been praying in any Christian sense.

Here, however, an objector <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> remind me that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to my own
showing, various developments of Buddhism modified and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> contradicted
the original creed, and that what has been here <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> about prayer, is
only strictly applicable to early Buddhism as originally taught in the
most ancient texts.

I grant this—I grant that expressions of reverence for the Buddha, the
Law, and the Monkhood, developed into expressions of wants and needs,
and that these expressions, gradually led on to the offering of actual
prayers to deified Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas.

I admit that we ought to judge of Buddhism as a whole. We ought to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>
full consideration to its later developments, and the gradual sliding of
its atheism and agnosticism into theism and polytheism. We are bound to
acknowledge that Buddhism, as it extended to other countries, _did_
acquire the character of a theistic religious system, which, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span>
false, had in it some points of contact with Christianity.

Nevertheless, admitting all this, and taking into <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> all that can
be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> in favour of Buddhism as a religious system, it will be easy to
show how impossible it is to bridge over the yawning chasm which
separates it from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> religion.

It is, indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the strange phenomena of the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day, that

into raptures over the precepts of Buddhism[279], attracted by the
bright gems which its admirers delight in culling out of its moral code,
and in displaying ostentatiously, while keeping out of sight all its
dark spots, all its trivialities and senseless repetitions[280]; not to
speak of all those evidences of deep corruption beneath a whited
surface, all those significant precepts and prohibitions in its books of
discipline, which <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> no Christian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> soil his lips by

It has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> been asserted that <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the teaching in the Sermon on the
Mount, and in other parts of the Gospel narratives, is based on
previously current moral teaching, which Buddhism was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to

It is certainly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the main idea implied by Buddhism is

enlightenment of mind, resulting from intense self-concentration and
introspection, from intense abstract meditation, combined with the
exercise of a man’s own reasoning faculties and intuitions.

Of what nature, then, was the so-called <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> that radiated

regard to such momentous questions, a downright Agnostic. The primary
origin of evil—the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> act—was to him an inexplicable mystery.

Was it, then, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the goodness, justice, holiness, and

No; the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> was in these respects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> mere and sheer
darkness. In these respects, too, he acknowledged himself a thorough
Agnostic. He admitted that he knew of no being <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than himself.

What, then, was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> that broke <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Buddha? What was this
enlightenment which has been so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> written about and extolled? All
that he claimed to have discovered was the origin of suffering and the
remedy of suffering. All the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to which he attained

the desire for continuity of life; that suffering is inseparable from
life; that all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is suffering; and that suffering is to be got rid of
by the suppression of desires, and by the extinction of personal
existence.

Here, then, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> contrast. When the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to his
converts, ‘Come (ehi), be my disciple,’ he bade them expect to get rid
of suffering, he told them to stamp out suffering by stamping out
desires (see pp. 43, 44). When the <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to His disciples, ‘Come,
follow Me,’ He bade them expect suffering. He told them to glory in
their sufferings—nay, to expect the perfection of their characters
through suffering.

It is certainly noteworthy that both Christianity and Buddhism agree in
asserting that all <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> groaneth and travaileth in pain, in
suffering, in tribulation. But mark the vast, the vital distinction in
the teaching of each. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> taught <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to be patient under affliction,
and to aim at the glorification of the suffering body, the other taught
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to be intolerant of affliction, and to aim at the utter annihilation
of the suffering body.

What <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> our Bible? We Christians, it says, are members of Christ’s
Body—of His flesh and of His bones—of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Body</span> which was once a
suffering Body, a cross-bearing Body, and is now a glorified Body, an
ever-living, life-giving Body. Hence it teaches us to honour and revere
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> body; nay, almost to deify the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> body.

A Buddhist, on the other hand, treats <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> kind of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with contempt,
and repudiates as a simple impossibility, all idea of being a member of
the Buddha’s body. How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> a Buddhist be a member of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> which was
burnt to ashes—which was calcined,—which became extinct at the moment
when the Buddha’s <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> personality became extinguished also?

But, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> the admirers of Buddhism, at least you will admit that the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> told <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to avoid sin, and to aim at purity and holiness of life?
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> of the kind. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> had no idea of sin as an offence against
God, no idea of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> holiness (see p. 124).

fourteen hours, from 5 p.m. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> evening to 7 a.m. next morning, and I
fasted all the time.’

I asked, ‘What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> did you expect to get by going through this task?’
He replied, ‘I hope I have laid up an abundant store of merit, which
will last me for a <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> time.’

This, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> me tell you, is a genuine Hindu notion. It is of the very
essence of Brahmanism, of Hinduism, of Zoroastrianism, of Confucianism,
of Muhammadanism. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> more of the essence of Buddhism. For, of

actions in <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> and previous forms of life. Nor did the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> ever
claim to be a deliverer from guilt, a purger from the taint of past
pollution. He <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> pretended to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> free from the penalty,
power, and presence of sin—from the bondage of sinful acts and besetting
vices. He <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> professed to furnish any cure for the leprosy of man’s
corrupt nature—any medicine for a dying sinner[283]. On the contrary, by
his doctrine of Karma he bound a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and foot to the inevitable

Yes, in <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> alone there is deliverance from the bondage of former
transgressions, from the prison-house of former sins; a total cancelling
of the past; a complete blotting-out of the handwriting that is against
us; an entire washing <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> guilty stain; the opening of a clear

Still, I seem to hear some admirers of Buddhism say: We admit the force
of these contrasts, but surely you will allow that in the moral <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> we find precepts identically the same as those of
Christianity—precepts which tell a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> not to <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> the world, not to

Well, I admit all this.

Buddhist precepts command total abstinence in cases where Christianity
demands only temperance and moderation. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> contrast, as I have

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to bear in their application.

Buddhism, I repeat, says: Act righteously through your own efforts, and
for the final getting rid of all suffering, of all individuality, of all

the character of humanity.

Then again, when it spread to outlying countries it assumed the
character of a religion; it taught the existence of unseen worlds; it
permitted the offering of prayers to Maitreya and other supposed
personal saviours; it inculcated faith and trust in these celestial
beings, which operated as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> motives in the hearts of many, while the
hope of being born in <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> conditions of life, and the desire to
acquire merit by reverential acts, led to the development of devotional
services, which had <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in common with those performed in Christian
countries. Nay, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> be admitted that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Buddhists in the

sacred objects of all kinds—so conspicuous as in modern Buddhist
countries.

But if, after making all these concessions, I am told that, on my own
showing, Buddhism was a kind of introduction to Christianity, or that
Christianity is a kind of development of Buddhism, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> ask you to

the false philosophy, and from the later religious systems developed out
of it.

And first, observe that Buddhism has <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> claimed to be an exclusive
system. It has <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> aimed at taking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of other religions. On
the contrary it tolerates all, and a Buddhist considers that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

even, strange to say, a Christian.

A Christian, on the other hand, holds as a cardinal doctrine of his
religion, that there is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Name</span> under <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> men,

in <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> and a believer in <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> implies an utter contradiction in

Then it need scarcely be repeated here that <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> is before all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

with such monstrous legends, absurd figments, and extravagant fables,

the biography of Christ, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an idle task.

And perhaps the most important is, that <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> constantly insisted on
the fact that He was God-sent, whereas the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> always described
himself as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> sent.

All that he affirmed of himself was that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be a
teacher of perfect wisdom, by a force derived from his own acts. By that
force alone he had passed through innumerable bodies of gods, demi-gods,
demons, men, and animals, until he reached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> out of numerous heavens,

the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> down to be born on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in a rich and princely family;
to be <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> up amid luxurious surroundings, and finally to go <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> as
a mendicant-monk, depending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> for his daily food and doing
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> for his own support.

Then, again, <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> as He grew up showed no signs of earthly majesty in
his external form, whereas the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is described as marked with
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> mystic symbols of universal monarchy on his feet and on his
hands, and taller and more stately in frame and figure than ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> beings (see pp. 476, 501).

Then, when each entered on his ministry as a teacher, <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> was
despised and rejected by kings and princes, and followed by poor and
ignorant fishermen, by common people, publicans, and sinners; <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was
honoured by kings and princes, and followed by rich <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and learned
disciples.

Then <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> had all the treasures of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> hidden in Himself, and

Truth,—Himself their Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and
Redemption. <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> declared that all enlightenment and wisdom were to be
attained by his disciples, not through him, but through themselves and
their own intuitions; and that, too, only after <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> and painful
discipline in countless successive bodily existences.

Then in regard to the miracles which both the Bible and the Tripi?aka
describe as attestations of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of the teaching of each, contrast
the simple and dignified statement that ‘the blind receive their sight,
the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> them[288],’ with

20, 24)[289]: ‘At the command of the Blessed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> the five hundred pieces
of fire-wood <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be split and were split, the fires <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be
lit up and were lit up, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be extinguished and were extinguished.
Besides he created five hundred vessels with fire. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the number of
these miracles amounts to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand five hundred.’

Then, although each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> use of missionary agency, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> sent <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span>
his high-born learned monks as missionaries to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at the
commencement of his own career, giving them no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> commission; the
other waited till the close of His own ministry, and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to His
low-born, unlearned disciples, ‘As My <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> sent Me, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> so send

Then, when we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to compare the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each, the contrast reaches
its climax; for <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> was <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> violently by wicked men, and
died in agony an atoning death, suffering for the sins of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> at
the age of thirty-three, leaving behind in Jerusalem about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hundred
and twenty disciples after a short ministry of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> years. Whereas the
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> died peacefully <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> his friends, suffering from an attack of
indigestion at the age of eighty, leaving behind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> thousands of

And what happened after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of each? Christ, the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> One, saw no
corruption, but rose again in His <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> glorified body, and is alive
for evermore—nay, has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in Himself ever flowing in life-giving
streams towards His people. The <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> is dead and gone for ever; his
body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the testimony of his own disciples, was burnt more
than 400 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before the Advent of Christ, and its ashes were
distributed everywhere as relics.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the Buddha’s own declaration, he now lives only in the
doctrine which he left behind him for the guidance of his followers.

And here again, in regard to the doctrine left behind by each, a vast
distinction is to be noted. For the doctrine delivered by <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> to His
disciples is to spread by degrees everywhere until it prevails
eternally. Whereas the doctrine left by Buddha, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it advanced
rapidly by leaps and bounds, is, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to his own admission, to fade
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> by degrees, till at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of 5000 <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> it has disappeared
altogether from the earth, and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> descend to restore
it. (Compare Postscript at <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of Preface, p. xiv.)

Then that other <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be followed by countless succeeding Buddhas
in succeeding ages, whereas there is only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> Christ, who can have no
successor, for He is alive for ever and for ever <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> with His
people: ‘Lo, I am with you alway, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the world.’

Then observe that, although the Buddha’s doctrine was ultimately written
down by his disciples in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> collections of books, in the same
manner as the doctrine of Christ, a fundamental difference of
character—nay, a vast and impassable gulf of difference—separates the
Sacred Books of each, the Bible of the Christian and the Bible of the
Buddhist.

The characteristic of the Christian’s Bible is that it claims to be a
supernatural revelation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it attaches no mystical talismanic virtue
to the mere sound of its words. On the other hand, the characteristic of
the Buddhist Bible is that it utterly repudiates all claim to be a
supernatural revelation; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the very sound of its <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> is believed to
possess a meritorious efficacy capable of elevating any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who hears it
to heavenly abodes in future existences. In illustration I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> advert to
a legend current in Ceylon, that once on a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> 500 bats lived in a cave
where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> monks daily recited the Buddha’s Law. These bats gained such
merit by simply hearing the sound of the words, that, when they died,
they were all re-born as men, and ultimately as gods.

Then as to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> themselves, contrast the severely simple and
dignified style of the Bible narrative, its brevity, perspicuity,
vigour, and sublimity, its trueness to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and inimitable pathos,
with the feeble utterances, the tedious diffuseness, and I <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> almost
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> ‘the inane twaddle’ and childish repetitions of the greater portion
of the Tripi?aka (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> 2, p. 541).

But again, I am sure to hear the admirers of Buddhism say: Is it not the
<span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> that the doctrine of Buddha, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the doctrine of Christ, has
self-sacrifice as its key-note? Well, be it so. I admit that the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span>
taught a kind of self-sacrifice. I admit that he related of himself
that, on a particular occasion in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of his previous births[290], he
plucked out his own eyes, and, that on another, he cut off his own head
as a sacrifice for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of others; and that again, on a third
occasion, he cut his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to pieces to redeem a dove from a
hawk[291]. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> the vast distinction between the self-sacrifice
taught by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> systems. Christianity demands the suppression of
selfishness; Buddhism demands the suppression of self, with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
object of extinguishing all consciousness of self. In the one, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> is elevated and intensified. In the other, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> is
annihilated by the practice of a false <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of non-selfishness, which
has for its real object, not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of others, but the annihilation of
the Ego, the utter extinction of the illusion of personal individuality.

Furthermore, observe the following contrasts in the doctrines which each
bequeathed to his followers:—

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">According</span> to Christianity:—Fight and overcome the world.

Nay, more—Christ Himself honoured a wedding with His presence, and took

Buddhism, on the other hand, says:—Avoid married life; shun it as if it
were ‘a burning pit of live coals’ (p. 88); or, having entered on it,
abandon wife, children, and home, and go about as celibate monks,
engaging in <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but in meditation and recitation of the Buddha’s
Law—that is to say—if you aim at the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> degree of sanctification.

And then comes the important contrast that in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> system we have a
teaching gratifying to the pride of man, and flattering to his
intellect; while in the other we have a teaching humbling to his pride,
and distasteful to his intellect. For Christianity tells us that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> as little children, and that when we have done all that we can,
we are still unprofitable servants. Whereas Buddhism teaches that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span>

Fitly, indeed, do the rags worn by the monks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Buddhism symbolize
the miserable patchwork of its own self-righteousness.

Not that Christianity ignores the necessity for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works; on the
contrary, no other system insists on a lofty morality so strongly; but
<span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> as the meritorious instrument of salvation[292]—only as a
thank-offering, only as the outcome and evidence of faith.

Lastly, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> advert again to the most momentous—the most essential of

    the connexion which I wish to illustrate clearer. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> images of

    of the living Sannyasi. Then mark other particulars in the
    portrait:—e.g. the Rudraksha rosary round the neck (see ‘Brahmanism
    and Hinduism,’ p. 67). Then in front of the raised seat of the
    Sannyasi are <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> ceremonial implements. First, observe the
    Kama??alu, or water-gourd, near the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> corner of the seat.
    Next, in front of the seat, on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of the figure, is the
    Upa-patra—a subsidiary vessel to be used with the Kama??alu. Then,
    in the middle, is the Tamra-patra or copper vessel, and on the left
    the Pañca-patra with the Acamani (see ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ pp.
    401, 402). Near the left <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> corner of the seat are the wooden
    clogs. Finally, there is the Da??a or staff held in the left hand,
    and used by a Sannyasi as a defence against <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits, <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> as
    the Dorje (or Vajra) is used by Northern Buddhist monks (see p. 323

    knots, possibly symbolical of six ways (Gati) or states of life,

[11]Tapas is a Sansk?it word, derived from the root tap, ‘to burn,
    torment.’ It is connected with Lat. tepeo, Greek {Thaptô}, which
    last originally denoted ‘to burn,’ not ‘to bury’ dead bodies. Tapas
    ought not to be translated by ‘penance,’ unless that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is

[15]The Bhagavad-gita (V. 28) asserts:—‘The sage (Yogi) who is
    internally happy, internally at peace, and internally illumined,
    attains extinction in Brahma.’ This is pure Buddhism if we
    substitute Cessation of <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> existence for Brahma.

[19]The ?atapatha-brahma?a (p. 1064) and the B?ihad-ara?yaka Upanishad
    (p. 455) affirm that the ?ig- Yajur- Sama- and Atharva-veda, the
    Upanishads, Itihasas, and Pura?as were all the breath (ni??vasitani)
    of the Supreme Being. And Saya?a, the well-known Indian Commentator
    on the ?ig-veda, speaking of the Supreme Being in his Introduction,
    says, Yasya ni??vasita? Veda?, ‘whose breath the Vedas were.’

[20]How else can we <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for Pa?ini’s applying the term Bhasha to
    colloquial Sansk?it? Professor E. B. Cowell holds that Pa?ini’s
    standard is the Brahma?a language as opposed to the Sa?hita of the
    Veda and to Loka or ordinary usage.

[21]According to Professor Rhys Davids, the Pali <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>

    of all the early disciples of Gautama.

[23]Professor Oldenberg, in his preface to his edition of the
    Maha-vagga, shows that in early times there were only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> divisions

    which were often contrasted.

[25]According to Professor Oldenberg’s calculation. The date is
    doubtful. A round number (say 350 B.C.) <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be given.

[27]Professor Childers <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that Pali merely meant the language of

    Indicarum.’ The General reckons thirteen rock inscriptions,
    seventeen cave inscriptions, and six inscribed pillars.

    The eight most important rock inscriptions are those on (1) the Rock
    of Kapurda-garhi (at Shahbaz-garhi), in British Afghanistan, forty
    miles east-north-east of Peshawar—this is in the Ariano-Pali
    character; (2) the Rock of Khalsi, situated on the bank of the river
    Jumna, just where it leaves the Himalaya mountains, fifteen miles
    west of the hill-station of Mussourie; (3) the Rock of Girnar,
    half-a-mile to the east of the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Junagurh, in Kathiawar; (4)
    the Rock of Dhauli, in Kuttack (properly Ka?ak), twenty miles north
    of Jagan-nath; (5) the Rock of Jaugada, in a large <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> fort eighteen
    miles west-north-west of Ganjam in Madras; (6) Bairat; (7) Rupnath,
    at the foot of the Kaimur range; (8) Sahasaram, at the north-east
    <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the Kaimur. The second Bairat inscription is most important
    as the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which mentions <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> by name.

    The five most important pillars are: (1) the Pillar at Delhi <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>
    as Firoz Shah’s La?; (2) <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> Pillar at Delhi, which was removed
    to Calcutta, but has recently been restored; (3) the Pillar at

[45]The venerable Svami ?ri Saccidananda Sarasvati, in sending me a copy
    of the Bhagavad-gita with a metrical commentary, says, ‘It is the
    best of all books on the Hindu religion, and contains the essence of
    all kinds of religious philosophy.’ I find in the Madras _Times_ for
    October 29, 1886, the following: ‘At a meeting of the “Society for

    Temple in his Journals (II. 216) asserts that he often <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> married
    monks in Sikkim, and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> no secret of it. They are free to

[63]The Vaibhashika was divided into Sarvastivada (assertion of the real

[76]No doubt there are places in the South of India where there is

    remarked that the members of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> religious communions who hold very

[118]His proper title is ?ripada Suma?gala Unnanse. The title Unnanse is
    used by all the superior monks of Ceylon for ‘venerable’ (Sansk?it

[119]Suma?gala informed me that this was the only prayer used in Ceylon.

[125]Some write Lhasa (strictly Lhasa). I prefer Lhassa as best
    representing the pronunciation. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> ‘the <span class="t5 t7 t8 t11 t14 t17 t21 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of the gods’ (lha

[126]Bakshi is probably a corruption of Bhikshu. Koeppen <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> it is
    Mongolian for Ton. Mr. Edgar (Report, p. 39) pronounces Brom Ton
    Domton.

[127]Dr. Schlagintweit (p. 73) identifies this with the sect which wear

[129]It is remarkable that the expression {ho katabas} is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> of <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span>

[130]According to the _Times_ Correspondent Lhassa stands in no closer
    relation to China than the least dependent of Indian States to the
    British Empire; history, however, proves that China can, when her
    interests demand it, assume a very <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> position. The military

    nearly _nil_. The expulsion of the missionaries Huc and Gabet proves
    this.

[143]This is probably permitted with a view to prevent the study of
    Mongolian from entirely dying out. It is <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> that, although the
    Buddhist sacred books have <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> been translated into Mongolian,
    Chinese, and Tungusic, only the Tibetan texts are esteemed as
    canonical.

[144]The indomitable persevering Hungarian traveller, Alexander Csoma de
    Körös, already mentioned (at p. 70), was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> European to throw

    the task he had imposed on himself of searching out the progenitors
    of his race. More than eighty <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago he <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> out on his travels,
    and his search ultimately <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him to Tibet. There he devoted
    himself to the study of the Tibetan language and its sacred
    literature, taking up his abode in the monastery of Pugdal, in
    defiance of intense cold and other hardships. But his heroic energy
    did not <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> there. In 1831 he travelled from Tibet to Calcutta, and
    in that city, about the year 1834, published his Grammar and
    Dictionary of the Tibetan language, besides his table of contents of
    the Kanjur and the extra-canonical treatises. At length fancying
    himself qualified for the accomplishment of his self-inflicted task,
    he started off again, and died in Sikkim in April 1842. He is buried
    at Darjiling. We Englishmen, who ought to have taken the greatest
    share in these linguistic conquests—so important in their bearing on
    the interests of our Indian frontier—have hitherto, to our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
    discredit, almost entirely neglected them. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg
    and Paris have founded chairs of the Tibetan language, and nearly
    all that has been effected for promoting the study of Tibetan has
    been due to Russian and French scholars, and to German and Moravian
    missionaries, especially to Jäschke and Hyde.

    I am glad, however, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> from the annual address delivered by the

[156]See my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 367.

[157]I found, when in the South of India, that an image of Bhavani in a
    Hindu temple was very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that of the Virgin Mary in an adjacent
    Roman Catholic Church. I was told that the same Hindu carver carved
    both.

[158]We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that Hinduism, in the end, adopted <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself, and
    converted him into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the incarnations of Vish?u (see

[161]The shape is not quite the same as that of the Phurbu, but there

[165]According to Schlagintweit, those amulets which are curved round to
    a point are intended to represent the leaf of the sacred fig-tree.

[166]In this it did <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> service, at least for a time; for the cost of

    entails expenses in gifts to the Brahmans, etc., to the amount of
    300 rupees.

[167]Mr. Scott points out in his ‘Burman’ that this is especially the
    <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> in Burma.

[168]Scott’s ‘Burman,’ p. 125.

[169]My authority for this is Mr. J. F. Dickson’s pamphlet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ‘Notes
    and illustrations of Buddhism,’ etc.

[170]Scott’s ‘Burman,’ i. 282.

[171]The Dagabas of laymen have no umbrellas at the top (see p. 505).
    This privilege is only accorded to the monkhood (Scott’s ‘Burman’).

[172]This is mentioned by Huc as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as by Koeppen.

[173]He is sometimes represented seated on a Lotus, or born from a
    Lotus.

[174]Om is borrowed from the Hindus. It is their most sacred syllable,
    symbolical of their triad of gods, Brahma, Vish?u, and ?iva, denoted
    by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> mystical letter A, U, M (see my ‘Brahmanism,’ p. 402).
    When imported into Buddhism it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> possibly symbolize the Buddhist
    triad. Om is sometimes translated by Hail! Hum, as a particle of
    solemn assent, is sometimes translated by Amen! I prefer to treat
    both Om and Hum as untranslatable ejaculations.

[175]I had formed this opinion <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before I saw the same view hinted at
    in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Koeppen’s notes (see my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 33).
    It is certainly remarkable that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> Ma?i is applied to the male
    organ, and the female is compared to a lotus-blossom in the
    Kama-?astras. I fully believe the formula to have a phallic meaning,
    because Tibetan Buddhism is undoubtedly connected with ?aivism.

[176]Some think, however, that the six syllables owe their efficacy to
    their symbolizing the six Paramitas or transcendent virtues.

[177]Dr. Schlagintweit mentions (p. 121) that when Baron Schilling
    visited a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> convent he <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the Lamas occupied in preparing
    100 million copies of Om ma?i padme Hum to be inserted in a
    prayer-cylinder. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> states that the inscription relating to the
    foundation of the monastery of Hemis in Ladak (see p. 433 of these
    Lectures) records the setting up of 300,000 prayer-cylinders along
    the walls and passages of the monastery.

[178]The _Ma?i-padme_ prayer is itself for shortness often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Ma?i.

[179]Stupas and Caityas are explained at p. 504.

[180]So <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> Schlagintweit, but he adds that in some places passers by
    keep them to the right. Mr. Sarat Chandra Das <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> mentions this.

[181]According to Sir Richard Temple (Journal, p. 198) travellers walk
    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side and then on the other.

[184]Dr. Schlagintweit <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> that a Dhara?i to the following effect is
    often written on the flag: ‘Tiger, Lion, Eagle, and Dragon, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> they

    at Sravasti (p. 407), were both Gandha-ku?is.

[204]A magnificent edition of this <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in Tibetan, Mongol, Manchu, and

[205]Here, therefore, there was a Gandha-ku?i (see note, p. 404).

[218]This is very instructive in regard to the numerical proportion

[219]According to Cunningham, about B.C. 450.

[220]One for each of the 84,000 elements of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> (p. 499). The real

[221]It is difficult to understand exactly what these A??hayoga, Prasada

    considered objectionable, as no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> likes to submit to the indignity

[222]The objection to the hollow of trees was that spirits, ghosts, and
    goblins often took up their abode there.

[223]The term Vihara was afterwards usually applied to temples, or to
    buildings combining temple and monastery in one.

[224]Some authorities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> them in the sixth century of our era.

[225]This is curiously illustrated in a recent letter from a resident in

[226]It is for this reason that in the Tibetan language they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

    140), but Koeppen (ii. 341) is more correct in stating that Potala

    Greeks, and now Tatta. There is a tradition that this Potala was the
    original home of the ?akya tribe (see p. 21 of this volume).

[231]Koeppen translates this by the German sau, but <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

[234]Huc <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> ‘four leagues;’ Koeppen ‘drei meilen,’ which is incorrect.

[235]These are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> mentioned by Sarat Chandra Das and by Markham (p.

[237]My authority for all these details is Dr. Burgess’ Report.

[238]Copies of these were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> for me by a Sinhalese artist.

[239]In this description I have chiefly followed Mr. Scott.

[240]This description is based on Koeppen, ii. 234, and on the narrative
    of Sarat Chandra Das’ journey in 1881, 1882.

[241]Sarat Chandra Das mentions a ‘flag-pole forty feet high, on which
    are some inscriptions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tufts of yak hair, and several yak and
    sheep-horns.’ Possibly this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be the obelisk mentioned by Koeppen.

[242]One of these is the terrific goddess Paldan (p. 491), worshipped by
    all Tibetans and Mongols, and identified with the goddess Kali.

[243]My authority for this is Bishop Edward Bickersteth, the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span>
    Bishop in Japan.

[244]See my ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism’ (published by Mr. Murray of
    Albemarle Street), pp. 2-20.

[245]Another ancient statue but not so old, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> of a highly
    interesting type, was procured by me (for the Indian Institute at
    Oxford) from Buddha-Gaya on the occasion of my last visit in 1884,
    through the kind assistance of Mr. Beglar. It is in the erect
    attitude.

[246]See ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 214.

[247]A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> example of this tight-fitting robe is afforded by the
    ancient statue of the Buddha, mentioned at p. 467, note.

[248]When Gautama renounced his family and caste, he doubtless discarded
    the cord, just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Sannyasi is required to do (p. 78).

[249]In the Jaina statues, the lobes of the ears, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as I have
    observed, always touch the shoulders.

[250]Some think that this represents the wheel of the Cakra-varti
    emperor, or the wheel of the law, or the cycle of causes, or the
    continual revolution of births, deaths, and re-births. Dr. Mitra
    maintains that a lotus, and not a wheel, is always intended, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span>
    the lotus is often so badly carved that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> for any circular
    ornament.

[251]Dr. Rajendralala Mitra considers that curly locks were <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to
    Gautama <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> because the possession of curls is believed to be an
    auspicious sign. Some have actually inferred from the curl-like
    knobs, that <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a negro!

[255]There is a striking parallel in a well-known picture by Bernardino
    Luini (of the Milan school) of ‘Christ disputing with the Doctors’
    to be seen in our National Gallery.

[257]See especially an image in the British Museum. In China Bas-relief
    images of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> are sometimes inserted by Buddhist priests in large
    mussel-shells while the animal is living, and are covered by it with
    a coating of mother of pearl. This they call a miracle. An example
    is in the Indian Institute, presented by Mrs. Newman Smith.

[258]The sculptured figures of Padma-pa?i observed by me in the caves of
    Elora represent him with Amitabha in his head-dress.

    Yun or Sung-Yun.

    noteworthy,’ <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> Oldenberg, ‘that as the care for Buddha’s remains
    is not represented as belonging to the disciples, so the Vinaya
    texts are nearly silent as to the last honours of the deceased
    monks. To arrange for their cremation was probably committed to the
    laity.’

[264]Subsequently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Puri, and noted for the worship of Jagan-nath
    or K?ish?a, who became the successor of <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> as an object of
    worship (see p. 166 of this volume).

[265]Hardy’s ‘Eastern Monachism,’ p. 224. The size of the tooth does not
    seem very preposterous, on the assumption of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of the
    tradition that Gautama attained to the stature of twenty cubits.

[266]Mr. Lesley, in his ‘Lectures on the Origin and Destiny of Man,’
    states that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints sculptured on the summit of
    Mount Olivet, and worshipped by pilgrims as the marks left when
    <span class="t15 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> sprang into the sky at His ascension. There is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span>

    foot-prints at Poitiers in France. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> foot-prints of

[268]Spence Hardy’s ‘Eastern Monachism,’ p. 215.

[269]I conjecture that the Mucalinda-tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been the Sandal, for
    it is described in Sansk?it literature as infested by snakes. The
    fact of a serpent having emerged from the roots of this tree and
    protected the <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Buddha</span> instead of injuring him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> for the
    sacred character of the sandal-wood statue (see p. 408).

[270]Hardy’s ‘Eastern Monachism,’ p. 212.

[271]I noticed a fine specimen of this tree growing in the courtyard of
    the temple of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> Brahma at Pokhar, near Ajmere, visited by me
    in 1884. Near it were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Banyan trees, a Nim tree, and A?oka tree.
    Brahma’s other temple at Idar was not visited by me.

[272]Compare my translation of ‘?akuntala,’ pp. 90, 91 (fifth edition).
    The Christmas-tree with its suspended gifts offers a curious and
    interesting analogy. The wonderful tree described by Messrs. Huc and
    Gabet as seen by them (vol. ii. p. 53, Hazlett’s translation) can
    only be regarded as an example of a remarkably clever hoax.

[273]Mr. R. Sewell has written an interesting article on ‘Early Buddhist
    Symbolism,’ in which he connects <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> symbols with solar ideas
    derived from the West. Mr. Frederic Pincott thinks that the triple
    symbol stands for the ancient Y of the ‘Ye dharma’ formula.

[274]See my ‘Modern India,’ p. 193, published by Messrs. Trübner and
    Co., and ‘Brahmanism and Hinduism,’ p. 127.

[275]The Jaugada inscription has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Svastikas, the arms in each of
    which are bent in opposite directions.

[276]The expression Jainism corresponds to ?aivism, just as Jaina does
    to ?aiva. Consistency <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> require Bauddhism and Bauddha for
    Buddhism and Buddhist, but I fear the latter expressions are too
    firmly established.

[277]Niga??ha (also spelt Niggantha) is from the Sansk?it Nir-grantha,
    ‘having no ties or worldly associations.’

[278]Cicero (De natura deorum) derives _religion_ from relego, and
    explains it as a diligent practice of prayer and worship. <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span>
    have derived it from religo, and hold that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> ‘binding to
    God.’

    and their mouths got a bad odour. They told this matter to the
    Blessed One. “There are these five disadvantages, O Bhikkhus, in not
    using tooth-sticks—it is bad for the eyes—the mouth becomes
    bad-smelling—the passages by which the flavours of the food <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> are
    not pure—bile and phlegm get into the food—and the food does not
    taste <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> to him who does not use them. These are the five
    disadvantages, O Bhikkhus, in not using tooth-sticks.” “There are
    five advantages, O Bhikkhus” (etc., the converse of the last). “I
    allow you, O Bhikkhus, tooth-sticks.” Now at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the

    are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> tooth-sticks. Whosoever does
    so, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be guilty of a dukkata. I allow you, O Bhikkhus,
    tooth-sticks up to eight finger-breadths in length. And Sama?eras
    are not to be struck with them. Whosoever does so, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be guilty

    short a tooth-stick got it stuck in his throat. They told this
    matter to the Blessed One. “You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use too
    short a tooth-stick. Whosoever does so, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be guilty of a

[281]Although this Lecture was written and in type before the
    publication of the Bishop of Colombo’s article in the July (1888)
    number of the ‘Nineteenth Century,’ I need not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that I wish here,
    as the Bishop has done, to draw attention to the collection of
    ‘moral horrors’ existing in some parts of the Parajika books—the
    disgusting detail of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> conceivable <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of revolting vice,
    supposed to be perpetrated or perpetrable by monks.

[284]In regard to the Buddhist doctrine of terrific purgatorial torments

[292]A Buddhist writer in a Buddhist magazine, published in Ceylon, has
    lately taken me to task for asserting in a recent speech that
    Christianity denies the all-sufficiency of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> as an
    instrument of salvation. It is easy to quote passages, such as those
    in the epistle of St. James, in support of his one-sided view of
    this question, but I need scarcely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that the writer has <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> to

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
