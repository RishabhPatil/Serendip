Venerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> Bernard, you are held wonderfully in <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> honour by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God. You are a terror to the 
unlawful foolishness of the world; you burn in the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of God’s son; you are eager to win <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> for the banner of

living God, to attend to my questions. 

I am very concerned by this vision which has appeared to me in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of mystery, for I have never seen it 
with the external <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of the flesh. I who am miserable and more than miserable in my womanly <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> have 
seen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> wonders since I was a child.

to believe. 

Most gentle Father, you are secure; in your goodness please answer me, your unworthy servant, for since I 
was a child I have never felt secure, not for a single hour! Could you search your soul, in your piety and wisdom, 
and discover how you are instructed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, and pour consolation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me, your servant, from your

For in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> I know the inner <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the exposition of the Psalter and the Gospel and other books 
shown to me in this vision, which touches my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> like a consuming fire, teaching me these 
profundities of exposition. But it does not teach me writings in the German tongue - these I do not know - and 

I only know how to read for the simple meaning, not for any textual analysis. 3 Give me an answer as to what 
you think, for I am a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> ignorant of all teaching in external matters; I am taught inwardly, in my soul.

Hearing of your <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and piety I am comforted.

seen and heard. And sometimes, because I keep quiet, I am laid low by the vision and confined to my sickbed, 
unable to raise myself up. So I am sad, I lament before you: I am unstable with the movement of the wooden 
beam of the wine-press in my nature, the beam which grew at the prompting of the devil from the root in Adam 

(for which he was cast out as a wanderer in this exile wo rid). 5 But now I raise myself up, I run to you, I <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to 
you. You are not unstable, you ease the pressure of the wooden beam, you gain the victory in your soul! And it is 

not only yourself alone: you raise up the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to salvation!

2. The Action of the Will (from Scivias I, 4) 


In a series of images based on her concept of ‘greenness’, this digression in the middle o/Scivias 1, 4 presents 
some of Hildegard’s ideas on anthropology. Perhaps <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> before the letter to Bernard, it has been compared 
to writings by Hugh of St Victor and Honorius ofAutun and reveals how widely read she must have been, 
especially as she did not base the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> on one particular identifiable source. Di'awing on wide knowledge, 
Hildegard describes her understanding of such ideas as the relation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and body, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> understanding 
and the action of the will.

How the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> reveals its capabilities according to the capabilities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

simplicity, in youth strength, and in the fullness of age, when all the veins of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being are full, she 
brings forth her greatest strength in wisdom. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> a tree in its first growth brings forth tender 
shoots, goes on then to bear fruit and finally ripens that fruit to the fullness of utility. But afterwards in old age 
when a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being’s bones and veins incline to weakness, then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> reveals gentler strengths, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

leaves and branches as the tree begins to incline towards old age.

3. Redemption (Scivias II, 1 ) 


In a version of the creation, the fall of Adam, and the redemption of humanity, Hildegard presents the story of 
her vision in a series of mysterious pictures. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of God, for instance, is seen as a shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with a

redemption centres on the appearance of a ‘light-filled man’. In the original illustration to the scene, preserved 
in the Rupertsberg manuscript (see Introduction I. i), the ‘light-filled man’ is a reddish golden figure 
surrounded by large golden flames above his <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and emerging from a red and golden circle, presumably the 
dawn, at the bottom of the picture. 


Scivias, Part II, Vision 1 


And I, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, neither ablaze with the strength of strong lions nor learned in their exhalations , 1 
remaining in the fragility of the weaker rib, but filled with mystical inspiration, saw: a shining fire, 
unfathomable, inextinguishable, fully alive and existing <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of life; with a flame the colour of the air, brightly 
burning in the gentle breeze, and as inseparable from the shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being is inseparable from his 
inner organs. And I saw the shining flame glow white. And suddenly a dark sphere of air appeared, huge in size, 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the shining flame struck many blows, and at each blow a spark flew up so that soon the circle of air 
was <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to completion, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> shone forth in the fullness of perfection. The burning flame of 
heat moved towards a small clump of muddy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> lying on the circle of the ball of air. And it heated the clump 
of earth, turning it to <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood, and breathing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into it so that it rose up as a living man. Once this was 
done, the shining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with its flame burning bright in the gentle breeze offered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> a brilliant white flower 
that hung in the flame like a drop of dew on a stalk of grass. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> could smell its fragrance with his nose but 
not taste it with his mouth or touch it with his hands. And he turned away and fell into thick darkness from 
which he could not raise himself up. But the darkness grew and spread further and further across the air. Then 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> large stars appeared in the darkness, combining in their brightness, and after them many others, small and 
large, shining in <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> splendour. Finally a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> star appeared, radiating marvellous clarity and directing its 
splendour towards the aforesaid flame. But on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> a brightness like the dawn appeared, merging with the 
flame in a marvellous manner but nevertheless not becoming separated from the shining fire. And in this way, 
in the brightness of the dawn, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> will was kindled. 

But when I tried to consider more closely the kindling of that will, I was opposed by a secret seal on the 

vision, - and I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> to me from on high: ‘Of this mystery you may not see any more than is 
granted you through the miracle of belief.’ 

And I saw a light-filled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerge^ from the aforesaid dawn and pour his brightness over the 
aforementioned darkness; it repulsed him; he turned blood-red and pallid, but struck back against the darkness 
with such force that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who was lying in the darkness became visible and resplendent through this 
contact, and standing up, he came forth out of the darkness. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the light-filled man, who had emerged 
from the dawn, appeared in greater splendour than any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> tongue can express, and he proceeded to the 
utmost heights of immeasurable glory, where he shone out wondrously in the fullness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> fragrance and

4* Letter to Odo of Soissons 


This letter is a classic example of Hildegard’s willingness and ability, through the ‘living light’ as she put it, to 
participate in the scholastic controversies of her day. Odo, a theologian and <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> at Paris, <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of 
Hildegard at the Synod of Trier (1147-8) and wrote to ask her opinion of Gilbert Porreta’s statements on the 
Trinity, which were discussed at the Council ofRheims in 1148 (for Odo’s letter, see 32 below). In his thinking, 
Gilbert had sought to make a real distinction between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and the godhead. He termed the latter the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of

STRUGGLES FOR INDEPENDENCE 


7. Songs for Saint Disibod 


The universal community of the saints was a genuinely felt reality in the lives of Hildegard and her nuns, not 
only as an example to follow but also as a source of inspiration and a focus of devotion. This was especially

a monastery on the summit of the hill that later bore his name. Hildegard spent half her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on the

O mirum admirandum. Antiphon for Saint Disibod 1

to where the living height

of all the branches of the world.

8. Letter to Hartwig of Bremen 


Hartwig of Bremen was the brother of Richardis ofStade , and presumably well-known to Hildegard. 1 His 
mother, Marchioness ( Margravin ) Richardis, was related to the family offutta von Spanheim, and gave 
Hildegard her support during the preparations for the move to Rupertsberg which began in the late 11408.

9. Song for Saint Ursula 


Hildegard reserved a special devotion for the martyrs of the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> such as Ursula, killed with her many 
companions at Cologne by the Huns during the Dark Ages, and she wrote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> songs to be sung in her honour 
in church. The sequence as a type of song was intended to be inserted into the liturgy of the mass; divided into 
stanzas, its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> gave scope for longer meditations on a particular theme. The exact date when the following

O Ecclesia oculi tui. Sequence 1 

O Church, your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are like sapphire, 2 

and your ears like Mount Bethel, 3

In a vision of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> faith, 

Ursula loved the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of God, 

she abandoned husband and worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> 

and gazed at the sun, 

calling the fair youth and saying: 

‘I have eagerly desired* 

to come to you at the heavenly nuptials 

and sit with you, 

running to you on the pilgrim <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> like a cloud^ 
racing through the purest air like a sapphire.’ 

And after Ursula had said this, 
a rumour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> through the people. 

And they said: ‘In the innocence of her girlish ignorance, 
she does not know what she is saying.’ 

And they began to make fun of her, 

singing their songs, ^ 

until the fiery burden fell on her. 

Then they all acknowledged her, 

for rejection of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is like Mount Bethel. 

And they acknowledged also 


the pleasant fragrance of myrrh and incense, 
since rejection of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> had descended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> all. 

Then the devil sent out his troops 

to murder the most noble behaviour in their bodies. 

And all the elements <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> this with a loud cry 
and they shouted before the throne of God: 

‘Alas the red of the Lamb’s innocent blood 
has flowed 
at this betrothal.’ 

May all the heavens hear, 

may they praise the Lamb of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> harmony,

Virtues (13). The theme of the runaway daughter is also of interest, for it links the story to the later departures

Where am I in my exile? 1 In the shadow of death. What is this path I am walking on? The path of error. And 
what comfort do I have? The comfort of pilgrims. 

I was to have had a tent, a tabernacle 2 decorated with five square stones that shone brighter than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and 
the stars. And the stones were to shine not with the rising <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and stars but with the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the angels. Its 

foundations were to be topaz, with gemstones^ for its roof and walls. Its steps were to be covered with crystal 
and its streets paved with gold. I was to be the companion of angels! 

For I am the living breath4 which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> breathed into the dry dust of the earth. And so I was to know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and 
to feel God. 

But what misfortune! When the tent of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> realized that it could cast its <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> in all directions it pitched 

itself towards the north. 5 Abomination! There I was captured and robbed of my sight and joy of knowledge. All 
my garments were torn to shreds! 

And so I was drummed out of my inheritance. My captors dragged me to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of exile <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> beauty or 
honour. They threw me into slavery. They beat me with their fists and made me <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> with the pigs. 7 They sent me 

to a desert <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> and gave me bitter herbs to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> dipped in honey. Then they laid me in a wine-press^ and 
subjected me to many torments. They pulled off my clothes, striking me with many blows and sending me out to 
hunt. 

And I was made to catch all manner of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and venomous worms, like scorpions and vipers, which sprayed 
me all over with their poison till I sickened with weakness. They mocked me then and said, ‘Where is your 
honour now?’ 

I trembled all over, groaning in my misery, and I said: Where am I? Oh where have I come from? What 
comfort can I look for in this captivity? How can I break these chains? What eye can see my wounds and what 
nostrils can bear the stench of this affliction? What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> can anoint my wounds with oil? Who will ever show 
me mercy in my pain? 

May <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> hear my cry!

captivity! I am oppressed by bitter pains, for I am a pilgrim <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> comfort or support. Who will console me, 
for my mother has <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> me because I strayed from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of salvation. None will help me but God! 

Oh Zion, my mother, when I remember how I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have dwelt with you, then I look at this bitter captivity 

into which I have been thrown! And when I recall all the harmonies of music9 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> you, then I can only 
consider my wounds. And when I remember the joys and delights of your glory, then I curse these poisons with 
which they are polluted. 


Where shall I turn? Where shall I run to? My pain is immeasurable, since if I remain in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> plight, I will 
be a companion to them - the ones I knew shamefully in the country of Babylon. Where are you, Zion my 
mother? What misfortune! If only I had not <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> you! I could bear this pain more easily if I did not know you. 

Now I shall flee these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> companions! Wretched Babylon has loaded me with weights of lead; she oppresses 
me with heavy timbers so that I can scarcely breathe. But when I cry out to you, my mother, in my tears, 
wretched Babylon pours forth a crashing sound of rushing waters so that you cannot hear my voice. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> 
trouble, therefore, I will seek the narrow ways. And so I will escape my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> companions and my miserable 
captivity! 

When I had spoken these words, I ran down the narrow path and hid myself in a small cave towards the 
north, weeping bitterly since I had lost my mother. Here too I considered all my pain and all my wounds. Here I 
cried and wept, pouring out my tears so that all the pain and malice of my wounds were flooded with my tears. 

Suddenly, a pleasant fragrance touched my nostrils, like a gentle breeze sent to me from my mother. What 
sighs I uttered and what tears I shed when I felt that modicum of comfort! I cried and wept such tears of joy 
that even the mountain was moved in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> cave I had hidden. 

And I said, ‘O mother, mother Zion! What will become of me? Where is your noble daughter now? For how 
long, for how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> will I be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> your motherly tenderness, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> delight and joy with which you 
<span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me up?’ With these tears I was as glad as if I had actually seen my mother. 

But my enemies <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> my cries and said, ‘Where is our companion whom we have had until now to do 
everything we desired? Look how she calls on the citizens of heaven! Let us employ all our skills to guard her 
with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> care and attention so that she cannot escape us! Remember we had her completely in our power! If 
we do this, then she will follow us again.’ 

But I slipped out quietly from the cave where I had been hiding. I aimed to climb so <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> that my enemies 
could not <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> me. But they released such a sea of raging <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> against me that there was no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I could get over 
it. There was a bridge, but it was so small and narrow that I could not cross it. And on the other shore of the sea 
the mountains were so tall and jagged that I could not journey there either. And I said, ‘What can a poor 
creature do now? For a little while I was able to feel the benevolent presence of my mother, and I <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> she

captivity, my enemies will mock me more than ever before! I cried to my mother in tears and felt her sweet 
presence, but now she has abandoned me again!’ 

But I had been given strength by the sweet comforting influence of my mother which I had felt before. So 
now I turned to the east and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out again on the narrow paths. The paths were so <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of thorns and briars and 
other obstacles that I could hardly make any headway. Eventually, with much effort and stress, I made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> 
through, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> almost breathless with exhaustion from my labours. 

Tired and exhausted as I was, I at last reached the summit of the mountain in which I had previously hidden, 
and made my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> towards a gully where I had to descend. But there I stopped and looked. Vipers, scorpions, 
lizards and various other species of reptile were hissing their tongues at me and blocking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> down! 

‘Mother, where are you?’ I screamed in my terror. ‘I could have borne this pain more easily if I’d never felt 
your presence before. Now I’ll be thrown into captivity again where I was kept for so long! Where is your help 
now?’ 

It was then that I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> my mother’s <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> speaking to me, ‘Run, my daughter, run, for you have been granted 
wings to fly with by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Giver whom none can resist. Quickly, therefore, fly over all these creatures 
opposing you.’ And then, with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> feeling of comfort and release, I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up my wings and flew quickly over 
those venomous and death-dealing vipers. 


3 .The tabernacle 

And I came to a tabernacle, the inside of which was made of the hardest steel. And entering in, I performed 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> where before I had done deeds of darkness. 

In this tabernacle, therefore, towards the north, I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up a pillar of unpolished iron on which I hung small 
fans of various feathers moving back and forth. I found manna, and I ate it. 

Towards the east I built a fortification of square stones, kindling a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> within. Here I drank myrrh-flavoured 
wine with grape-must. 



Towards the south I made a tower of square stones on which I hung red shields; in the windows I placed 
trumpets of ivory. And in the middle of the tower I poured out honey and prepared a precious ointment of 
various spices, so that its strong fragrance permeated all of the tabernacle. 

Towards the west, however, I did no work, since that part was turned towards the world. 

But while I was occupied with this labour, my enemies <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up their quivers and attacked my tabernacle with 
their arrows. Because of the zeal with which I was doing my work, I did not notice the frenzy of their attacks 
until the door of the tabernacle was filled with arrows. Nevertheless none of their arrows was able to pierce the 

door or the steel covering of the tabernacle, and so I could not be harmed by them. 10 

Seeing this, they sent a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> torrent of waters to throw me down with my tabernacle, but they achieved 
nothing with their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> any <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> now, I derided them for their failure and said, ‘The Craftsman 
who made this tabernacle is stronger and wiser than you are. Gather up your arrows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> them 
away, for they cannot give you the victory you desire. Look and see: they have caused no injury!’ 

‘I have fought many wars against you in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> hardship and pain. You tried to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> but were 
unable, for I was armed with the most powerful of weapons; I brandished sharp swords against you and 
defended myself vigorously. Depart, therefore, and leave me, for you can do nothing more against me!’ 

7. How anger, hatred and pride are overcome 

When anger is about to burn up my tabernacle, I look to the goodness of God, whom anger has never touched, 
and so I become softer than the air which waters the dry <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> with its sweetness. Then the virtues and powers 
manifest the force of their green vigour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> joy is mine! In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I feel the goodness of 
God! 

But when hatred attempts to defame me, I look to the mercy and the pain of God’s Son, and so I contain my 
flesh, receiving the sweet fragrance of roses from the thorns which grew up in memory of the Faithful One. In 
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I acknowledge my Saviour! 

And when pride 11 strives to build <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a firm foundation rock and raise up his tower of vanity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me, 
and when he is about to reach a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> height that none can equal, and when I appear <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the others: oh, 
who will come to my aid? This is the ancient serpent wishing to be greater than all! It is he who has fallen into 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> and is trying now to throw me down with him! In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> sadness then I say: ‘Where is my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and my 
God? What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> can I do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> God? No good!’ 

And I look to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> who gave me life, and I run to the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Virgin who toppled the cave of pride of the 

ancient serpent. 12 In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I become a strong stone in God’s building. And the ravenous wolf who expired on 
the hook of divinity can no longer overcome me. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I acknowledge the sweetest good, that is 
humility, in the height of God. I taste the savour of unfading balsam and rejoice in the sweetness of God, as if I 
was inside the fragrance of all fragrances! In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> also I repel the other vices with the strong shield of 
humility.

benefit the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the king. You think to soar to the heights of vanity, while you plunge to the depths of the 
sea, where there is no goodness, where the fearful horror dwells that does not know God. Cast away such things, 
and you will walk to your salvation on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of truth. In your hearts then you will bear the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the dawn

II. Songs for Saint Rupert 


According to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of Hildegard by Gottfried of Disibodenberg and Theoderich of Echternach, the <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> to 
move from Disibodenberg came to Hildegard in a vision , accompanied by a bout of illness in which she 
remained until she consented to reveal what the vision had said to her. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to which she felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> was 
the Rupertsberg , or Mount St Rupert, a site on a large hill overlooking what is now the modern town of Bingen 
in the Rhine Valley. At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Hildegard’s move in 1150, there was just an old ruined chapel dedicated to 
the eighth-century saint, while the rest of the area was cultivated as a vineyard. Rupert’s original monastery 
had been destroyed by the Vikings in about 882, the foolish men’ alluded to in the sequence O <span class="t28 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> below. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the popular appeal of hagiography , Rupert became greatly honoured as the 
patron saint of the new monastery, and Hildegard, who also wrote a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of Saint Rupert, was active in 
furthering his cult and veneration. As she saw it, Rupert’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was short but inspiring, a <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that emerges in 
the themes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> antiphons and the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> stanza of the sequence below. With echoes of dedication hymns 
in its text, it is possible that this sequence was sung at the ceremony for the dedication of the new church on the 
Rupertsberg which probably <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on 1 May 1151.

12. The Departure of Richardis of Stade 


With the various difficulties faced by the new community, some of the nuns decided to leave the Rupertsberg, 
sometimes for positions elsewhere. In 1151 Richardis of Stade was appointed abbess ofBassum, in the diocese 
of Bremen, where her brother was Archbishop. Hildegard,for various reasons, including her personal affection 
for Richardis, opposed the appointment. A delegation from Bremen appealed to Archbishop Heinrich of Mainz, 
the diocese in which the Rupertsberg belonged. When ordered by Heinrich to release Richardis, Hildegard sent 

the following response (Letter 18R). 1 Eventually forced to submit, she sent a grieving letter to Richardis 
herself, now installed at Bassum. 2

Now I say to you this: whenever I sinned in that way, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> made my <span class="t0 t9 t11 t14 t17 t28 hoverable">sin</span> known to me, either in hardships or

an orphan? I loved you for your noble bearing, your wisdom, your purity, your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and all your life! So much so

13. The First Version of The Play of the Virtues (from Scivias III, 13) 


This dialogue, the first Morality play in medieval literature, occurs with other songs as part of the triumphant 
finale to Hildegard’s Scivias. Like ‘The Trials of the Soul’ (10), it tells the story of the flight, oppression by 
enemies, and eventual return of the errant soul. Its basic thematic structure is an allegory in which the various 
moral qualities in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being are conceived and externalized as active forces, the ‘virtutes’ or, as the 
<span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> implies, the ‘virtues and powers.’ Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> as fully developed as the Ordo virtutum 

(Play of the Virtues) of 1158, 1 since its list of characters is shorter and there is less dramatic breadth, it is 
perhaps more suitable for reading than the later performance piece. Arguably, there is a stronger focus on the 
plight ofAnima, the personified soul, as she struggles to <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> herself from the wiles of the deceiver. 

The exact date of the first version of the play is not known, although Abbess Tengswich ofAndemach may be 
referring to aperformance of the play in a letter dated 1148-50. One of the letter’s criticisms is of Hildegard’s 
unusual liturgical practices, for after a respectful opening, Tengswich continues: 

But a report of something unusual in your practices has also reached us. On feast days, your nuns stand in 
church chanting psalms with unbound hair and for decorative purposes wear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> white silk veils which reach 
down to the ground. On their heads they wear crowns of woven gold in which crosses have been placed on each 
<span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> and at the back, while a figure of the lamb is placed neatly at the front. And they adorn their fingers with 
golden rings. And they do this although the first shepherd of the Church forbade such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in his epistle, 

saying that women are to dress ‘with propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes’. 2 

Since Scivias itself was completed in 1151, about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that Richardis and others were leaving the 
community at the Rupertsberg it is at least possible that those external events influenced the contents of the 
first official <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> version of the work. But the play is more than a series of allegorized events from the 
author’s biography. Original as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of literature, its sources include the liturgy, the Bible, particularly the 
Song of Songs, and the Psychomachia (or Struggle of the Soul) by the late Roman poet Prudentius, in which the 
final triumph of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is also <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the virtues seizing the enemy, Discord, and so defeating him. 

9. For the encouragement of the virtues and the contradiction of the wiles of the devil 

And again that sound was heard, like the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of a multitude, for the exhortation of the virtues to assist 
humankind, for the contradiction of the hostile devices of the devil, for the defeat of the vices by the virtues and 
the return of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women to penance by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> inspiration. The sound rang out in harmony as follows. 

[THE VIRTUES:] 

We virtues are in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> 
and remain in God. 

We fight for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of kings

We appeared at the first battle 
and gained the victory, 

while he who wished to soar above himself fell to the ground. 

And so we fight now 

and come to the aid of all who <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> us: 
we trample the devices of the devil 
and we lead those who wish to follow us 
to the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> mansions. 


THE COMPLAINT OF THE SOULS, LOCATED IN THE FLESH: 


We wayfarers! 

What have we done, wandering into sins? 

We should have been the daughters of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> 
but fell into the shadow of sins! 

O living Sun, 

transport us on your shoulders 
into that most just inheritance 
which we lost in Adam! 

0 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of kings, 3 

we fight in your battle. 

PRAYER OF THE FAITHFUL SOUL: 

Sweet divinity, 
delightful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> 

in which I will wear a bright garment, 
accepting what I lost at my first appearance, 

1 sigh for you, and I invoke all the virtues. 

RESPONSE OF THE VIRTUES: 

Happy soul, 

beautiful creature of God, 

you are formed in the profound depths of the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of God, 4 
you express <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> measure.5 

THE FAITHFUL SOUL: 

Oh let me come to you with gladness, 

that you may bestow on me the kiss of your heart! ^ 

VIRTUES: 

Daughter of the King, 
we must join you in the fight. 

THE SOUL, DEJECTED, LAMENTS: 

What grievous distress, what a heavy weight 

I bear in the garment of this life, 

since it is too hard for me to fight against the flesh. 

VIRTUES: 

O soul, formed by the will of God, 

O happy instrument, 

why are you so weak when you face 

what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> defeated through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Virgin? 

In us you are bound to conquer the devil! 

SOUL:

THE SIBYL OF THE RHINE 


14. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Political Letters 


As Hildegard became established at Rupertsberg, she began to gain a reputation for prophecy and political 
<span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as theological understanding, and it was in this role as adviser and prophetess that she became 
known as the ‘Sibyl of the Rhine’. Soon her direct advice was being sought, and given, in the current affairs of 
the German Empire and the Church. The letters here, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> difficult to date precisely, illustrate aspects of this 
activity. 

The letter to Pope Eugenius <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> is markedly different in tone from her earlier one to the same correspondent 
(6); the language is more apocalyptic, with the sword of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> justice circling in the air, and there is some 
intriguing animal imagery. It is tempting to relate the image of the bear to the new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Germany, Frederick 
Barbarossa, who signed a political agreement with Eugenius at the Treaty of Constance in 1153. 

The letter to Henry (Bishop of Liege 1145-64) is similarly urgent, with its imagery of dark clouds ominously 
threatening the mountain of flowers and gentle breezes. The dark clouds are a less precise kind of metaphor 
than that of the bear, but the implication is that the Church is somehow threatened. Henry was loyal to 
Barbarossa and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> part in the first Italian expedition of 1154, attending the Emperor’s coronation by Pope 
Hadrian IV in 1155. 

Hadrian IV was an Englishman and vigorous politician who at first honoured the Treaty of Constance by 
ousting the leader of the Senate, Arnold of Brescia, from Rome and by crowning Barbarossa as Emperor. But 
his agreement with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> William I of Norman Sicily in 1156 <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> a radical change of policy. In October 1157 
a letter from Hadrian, delivered by his legates to the Diet of Besanqon, provoked a bitter row with Barbarossa 
and his chancellor Rainald Dassel, who interpreted its requirements as a threat to imperial power. Hildegard’s 
letter to Hadrian presents a series of apocalyptic images and metaphors which, although bafflingly unclear, are 
of undoubted relevance to the events of Hadrian’s pontificate. 



Hildegardto Pope Eugenius III, 1148-53 [Letters] 

He who is not silent speaks - because of the weakness of those who are too blind to see, too deaf to hear, too 

dumb to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> - that robbers lie in wait by night 1 with death-dealing weapons! And what does he say? The 
sword circles and turns, killing those who are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in mind! 

You in your <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> are a shining breastplate, 2 the primary root, the presider at Christ’s nuptials with the 
Church. But you are divided in your attentions. On the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is renewed in the mystic flower that 

is the companion of virginity/ on the other, you are the branch of the Church.4 Listen to the One who strikes 
with his name and flows in the torrent; listen to him speaking to you: do not cast the eye from the eye, do not 
cut off the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> from the light; but stand on the even path, lest you be accused for the sake of those souls who 
have been placed in your bosom. Do not allow them to sink in the lake of perdition through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the 
feasting prelates! 

A jewel lies on the path, but a bear5 comes along. Seeing the beautiful jewel, he stretches out a paw to seize it 
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it in his bosom. But suddenly an eagle appears, snatches the jewel, wraps it in the cover of his wings 
and bears it away to the inner courtyard of the palace of the king. That very jewel shines out its radiance in the 

presence of the king. And for <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the jewel, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> presents the eagle with golden shoes/ praising him 
highly for his goodness. 

You now, the viceroy of Christ, seated on the throne of the Church, choose for yourself the better part/ that 
you may be the eagle overcoming the bear! Adorn the inner courtyard of the Church in the souls entrusted to 
you, so that in your golden shoes you may come to the heights and remove yourself far from the intruder’s 
grasp!

Hildegard to Pope Hadrian IV, 1155 [Letter 9] 


The one who gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to the living says this.

strength of leopards. You will experience shipwreck in the taking of spoils. For you have been given over to all 
those who seek refuge with you in their <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of exhaustion. Nevertheless you have a ready understanding with 
which to pit yourself against the fierce behaviour of men. In raging at them you hang on firmly to the manes of 
the galloping horses which run ceaselessly along the tracks of plunder. But you fight against yourself when at 
times you favour the apparent probity of certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> if you hide the treasure-chests of those killed in conflict

15. Songs for the Dedication of a Church 


The first of the following antiphons was perhaps <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in 1155 If Hildegard wrote the song for the dedication 
of a particular church building its identity is unknown, but the ‘church’ twice mentioned in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> must also 
be seen as the universal Church, facing its enemies the ‘most savage wolf and the ‘cunning serpent’ (i.e. the 
devil). In the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> antiphon, the serpent is defeated and the Church can rejoice in harmony that all its 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> have been reunited. The imagery could be understood on a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of levels, from a survey of 
salvation history on one level to a prediction of the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> on another. In <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the animal imagery in the 
letter to Pope Hadrian IV, it may be that the ‘wolf ofO virgo ecclesia represents a particular threat to the 
Church at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the song was composed, one possibility being the threat to papal supremacy of the still 

powerful Roman Commune under Arnold of Brescia. 1 The threat was removed by the Pope’s own swift actions 
after his election to the papal see in December 1154. Shortly before Easter in 1155, when one of the cardinals 
was attacked and wounded by Arnold’s followers, Hadrian placed an interdict over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the population 
of Rome, shutting all the churches until Arnold and his party had been banished from Rome. Under pressure 
from the citizens and clergy, the Senate agreed, and the Pope was able to celebrate Easter in triumph. 

O virgo ecclesia. Antiphon 


O virgin church, you must lament 

that the most savage wolf 

has seized your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> from your side. 

Woe to the cunning serpent! 

But how precious is the blood of the Saviour! 

In the banner of the king3 

he has pledged the Church to himself 

so that she now seeks her children. 


Nunc gaudeant. Antiphon4 

May the maternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of the Church now rejoice 
that her <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> have been gathered to her lap 
in heavenly harmony. 

Therefore, shameful serpent, you are confounded, 
because those you <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> were in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> 
now shine in the blood of God’s son. 

Praise to you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> on high, alleluia.

The principles on which Hildegard based her advice and admonitions to the principal churchmen and 
politicians of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> are <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out extensively in the pages of Scivias, from which the following extracts are 
taken. The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> was much in demand: in the early 1150s, for instance, Archbishop Arnold of Cologne expressed 

a wish to have a copy, for he was ‘unable and unwilling to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it’. 1 In responding to his request, 
Hildegard sent the following message as a covering letter: 

Now, as you wished, shepherd of your people, I (a poor woman) have sent you my writings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> visions to

of practical use, for her teachings on the Church cover not only theological and doctrinal issues but also social 
matters and questions relating to ethics. Hildegard has much to say on the sacraments, the role of the monastic 
orders, and the duties of priests and bishops. She uses characteristic vocabulary, such as ‘perfumes’ for priests, 
and adapts images and stories from the Bible, such as the theme of the ‘green garden’, employed here to attack 
the frequent twelfth-century practice of dedicating young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> against their will to the monastic life.

17. Letter to Elisabeth of Schonau 


Elisabeth of Schonau was a fellow visionary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> prophetic writings were sometimes associated with those of 
Hildegard. One important manuscript, for instance, which preserves the oldest version of Hildegard’s songs, 

was <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> at Rupertsberg and sent by Hildegard to the friendly Cistercian monastery ofVillers in Brabant. 1 
Its main contents are: (l) Hildegard’s <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits, (2) Elisabeth of Schonau s <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of the Ways of 
God, (3) Hildegard’s Symphonia, and (4) a short anonymous dialogue. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> influenced by Hildegard, 
Elisabeth differed in many ways from her: she was unable to write Latin, and so <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> the services of her 
brother, the priest Eckbert, to turn her dictated German into <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> Latin; her visions were experienced while 
she was in a trance; they show less evidence of the wide reading that characterizes Hildegard’s work. In 
addition Elisabeth was far more ascetic than her mentor Hildegard (in this she might be compared to 
Hildegard’s erstwhile guardian Jutta ofSpanheim), and Hildegard warned her against the dangers of 
exaggerated austerity towards the body. In this particular letter, the warning to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care of the fragile vessel’ 
is an implied rather than openly critical condemnation of excessive abstinence, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a letter which places its 
emphasis on the positive aspects of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the history of salvation.

needs someone else to blow into it so that it will make a sound. But let the mild, the gentle, the poor and the 

needy put on the breastplate of faith, 10 as also the Lamb was their trumpet and they are now the sound; and in 
their characters they are like simple children. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> always scourges those who sing forth in his trumpet,

am very tired, anxious and fearful, at times sounding forth as the small sound of the trumpet from the Living 
Light. May <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> help me that I remain in his service.

seminary to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> as a basis for a new foundation. Gertrud and the other nuns moved there in 1157 and

19. Letter to the Abbess of Bamberg 


This letter, to an unknown abbess L. at the Abbey of St Theodore and St Mary at Bamberg, shows another <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> 
to Hildegard’s views on education, discipline and the training of young oblates. It should be seen against the 
background of the Benedictine Rule, which regulated the communal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the monastery, and on which 
Hildegard wrote a commentary. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Chapter</span> 5 of the Rule, for instance, states that ‘the first degree of humility is 

obedience <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> delay. This is the virtue of those who hold nothing dearer to them than Christ.’ 1

Daughter of God, know that you yourself are this field because you embrace the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with your

abandon them for lack of leisure time, since useless weeds will often grow wherever there is leisure. You should 
put before you a vision of the firmament so that you do not hide the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of your <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> behind black clouds of

20. The Cosmic Egg (from Sciiuas I, 3) 


A famous image in Hildegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is that of the ‘cosmic egg’, a survey of the cosmos which forms the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> 
vision of the first <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> o/Scivias. This vision is descriptive, but also highly allegorical, and it is worth noting 
that although each detail of the description represents a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> in Hildegard’s universe, she also 
attaches a further significance to it in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> and the events of history. In so doing she implies that 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and the universe are closely and inextricably connected, as microcosm and macrocosm. This ties in 
with her exalted <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being in Scivias 1 , 3, 17 (translated below), a characteristic attitude of the 
twelfth-century Renaissance. 


The cosmic egg 

After these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> I saw a huge form, rounded and shadowy, and shaped like an egg ; 1 it was pointed at the top, 
wide in the middle and narrower at the bottom. Its outer layer consisted of an atmosphere of bright <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> with a 
kind of dark membrane beneath it. And in that outer atmosphere there was a ball of red <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> so large that all the 
huge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> was lit up by it. Directly above the fireball was a vertical row of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lights which held it with their 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy and prevented it from falling. 

At times the fireball rose upwards and was met by more fire, which caused it to shoot out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> flames. 
At times, however, the fireball moved downwards and encountered a region of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cold that caused it quickly 
to retract its flames. 

From the outer atmosphere of fire, a wind blew storms. And from the dark membrane beneath, another wind 
raged with further storms which moved out in all directions on the globe. The dark membrane contained also a 
dark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of such horror that I was unable to perceive it properly. The horror buffeted the dark membrane with a 

massive impact of sounds and storms and sharp stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and small . 2 Whenever the noise arose it <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in 
motion the layer of bright fire, winds and air, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> causing bolts of lightning to presage the sounds of thunder; 
for the fiery energy senses the first agitations of the thunder <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it. 

Below the dark layer, however, was the purest of ether with no membrane beneath it. Here also I saw a 
fireball, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> magnitude, filled with white-shining energy; it had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> lights placed above it which held it and 
prevented it from passing beyond the circuit of its course. Situated everywhere throughout the ether were many 
bright spheres, into which the white fireball discharged its energy at regular intervals. It then rose up again to 
the red fireball where it recharged its fires and sent them forth again into the bright spheres. The ether also 
contained a wind, which poured out its storms and extended them all over the cosmos. 

Beneath the ether I could see a layer of watery air, which had a white membrane beneath it. It spread out 
everywhere, giving off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the world. At times it accumulated quickly and sent out a sudden 
fall of rain with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> crash. But when it spread gently it sent forth soft rain with only gentle agitation. But 
from it there came a wind and storms which spread all over the globe. 

And in the middle of these elements there was a sandy ball of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> size which was so surrounded by these 
elements that it could not move in any direction. However, when the winds collided with the elements, the force 
of their impact <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in motion a little. 

And I saw between the north and the east the likeness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain, which showed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> areas of

And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> speaking to me from heaven.

2. The significance of the cosmos made in the likeness of an egg 

‘I saw a huge form, rounded and shadowy, and shaped like an egg; it was pointed at the top, wide in the middle 
and narrower at the bottom.’ The large <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> which you see represents, on the level of faith, the omnipotent God, 
incomprehensible in his majesty, inconceivable in his mysteries, the hope of all the faithful. It was pointed at 
the top because at first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> activity was naive and simple; later in the Old and New Testaments it became 
more wide-ranging; finally towards the end of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> it is to endure the narrow constriction of many 
troubles.

‘And in that outer atmosphere there was a ball of red <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> so large that all the huge <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> was lit up by it.’ With 
the splendour of his brightness he shows that in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Father</span> is his ineffable firstborn son, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> of Justice,

‘Directly above the fireball was a vertical row of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> lights which held it with their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy and

21. The Cosmos (from Causes and Cures I) 


Causes and Cures, otherwise known as The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Compound Medicine, deals with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> of the cosmos, 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> body, health and the cure of ailments.

discussion, in a ‘non-prophetic’ style, of matters usually treated by Hildegard in the visions of her more widely 
read trilogy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> still rooted in the theology of its time, Causes and Cures is also more openly influenced by 
the philosophical and scientific ideas of the twelfth century. Its factual style mirrors the subject-matter, the 
sentence structure is simpler and clearer, and there is less frequent resort to the vivid, but also mysterious, 
allegorical imagery which figures in the passages on the cosmic egg from Scivias ( 20 ).

create other creatures. He had not seen the face of the Father; he did not know of his power, nor had he tasted

But because Lucifer in his perverse will wished to elevate himself to nothingness, all that he wished to create 
was indeed nothing, and he fell into it and could not stand since he had no ground beneath him. Indeed he had 
no height above him and no depth below him to prevent him from falling. But now, as he stretched forth to

On thunderstorms 


For in the thunder is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of judgement where there is both stench and cold.9 And whenever the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the

Lightning 

Some mild murmurings of thunder follow, and then they cease, like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is moved to anger but does not

raises its <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> loudly, like a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is moved to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> anger and expresses it in violent behaviour.

the clouds gather it up and disperse it and send it out onto the earth. 

Hail 

Hail is like the eye of the thunder. But when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> becomes lower in winter, it does not transfer its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the

burn any longer in the height of the heavens. 


The waters 

And so the waters which are in the upper reaches of the sky become like dust scattered by the cold, and they 
cause snow to fall. 


Rain 

But when they warm up and become milder again, they cause rain to fall, and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> in the meantime 
now manifests neither too much heat nor too much cold then it sometimes sends forth mild rain, just as 
someone will often shed tears of joy when they are happy. 

Winds 

The four cardinal winds support the firmament below and above the level of the sun. They hold <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> the

embraces the air and dispenses gentle moisture to the dry regions. The west wind mingles with the floating 
clouds, to sustain the waters and prevent them from bursting forth. The south wind keeps the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> under its 
control and prevents it from burning up everything. The north wind controls the outer areas of darkness, so that 

they do not exceed their measure. These four winds are the wings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God. 10 If they were all <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> in

But now they are securely locked by the keys of God’s majesty so that the elements are held in moderation in 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that they will not cause harm to anyone, except at the end of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> when all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> will be purified. 

Afterwards they will <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> their song back into harmony. 11 And no <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> being can exist that consists of only 
one property; rather it must demonstrate at least several such properties. 

On nothingness 

But nothingness has no particular property from which it might derive its existence; it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> quite simply 
nothing. For this reason, as soon as the other creatures voluntarily associate themselves with nothingness then 


they lose their own properties and also come to nothing.

The firmament has fire, sun, moon, stars and winds; it exists through all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and by their 
properties it is strengthened so that it does not fall apart. Just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> holds the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> body, so

And when they are agitated by a <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> command, they receive their breath and strength from the main winds.

From the beginning of the world, the main winds have never been fully agitated to their <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> strength, nor will 
they be so moved until the last day. But then they will reveal their strength and send forth the fullness of their 
blasts; because of their force and collisions, the clouds will be broken up and the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> firmaments will be 
folded up and torn apart, just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is broken and its limbs scattered when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is released and

The east wind has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> wings through which it attracts the globe of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> to itself.

is an obstacle to it to prevent it from moving in another direction from where it was intended to move. And this 
wind brings all kinds of moisture and brings about all kinds of germinations. 

The west wind could be compared to a mouth to convey and dispense all the waters, so that it divides and 
disperses all the waters onto their right paths in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> may rise above the other but will run its

anything with which it comes into contact. 

The south wind is like a kind of iron rod with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> branches at the top and a sharp point at the bottom. Its 
strength is like steel so strong that it can restrain both the firmament and the abyss. For just as steel overcomes 
and supersedes all other metals, and just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> strengthens the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, so the strength of this wind 
contains the firmament and the abyss of this region so that it does not collapse. 

And at the top it has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> strengths like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> branches, one of which tempers the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> as it rises, another

not exceed its normal function in those regions. It is sharply pointed at the bottom because its strength is also 
fixed in the abyss so that the moisture and the cold do not rise up beyond all moderation. 

The same wind brings all growing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to maturity: it causes the ripening of the leaves in the trees and the 
grass, the crops, the apples and all the other fruits of the earth. 

The north wind is like four pillars which hold <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> all the firmament and all the abyss. When it removes

contain the four elements, which are closely connected, confined and as it were supported by the pillars so that 
they do not fall. When on the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> this wind moves the four pillars by its strength, then the firmament will 


be folded like a book. And this wind is cold, and bears the cold with it. Using its cold it constrains all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and

And the sun, as was said before, is positioned at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">highest</span> point and so to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> in the middle of the

The moon 

The moon is made of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and thin air; it is situated in the air and has its habitat there, and the air is 
strengthened by the moon. After it has waned, the moon passes beneath the sun, from which a sphere is 

extended that attracts the moon closer to it, like a loadstone attracting iron to it. 1 ^ The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> then kindles <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in 
the moon, although the other planets and stars and the air and other heavenly bodies surrounding the moon 
burn towards it and contribute to the process of ignition. After it has been lit, the moon gradually waxes to its 
fullness like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> wood or a burning house, gradually catching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> until all of it is in flames. In the meantime, as 
the moon waxes to fullness, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> strengthens the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> parts of the firmament, never ceasing from its task. 
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> precedes and accompanies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> because the <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> firmament is bright, while the moon precedes 

and accompanies the night because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is dark. 1 ^ After the moon is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> so that it becomes like a pregnant 
woman, it sends forth its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and passes it on to the stars; in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the stars are made brighter. 

Dew 

Then also, from the same heat, the stars heat the air and strengthen it, and the warm air gives off it moisture as 
dew, sends it onto the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and so makes it fertile. And so the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is watered and produces fruits. For while 
the moon is emptying itself and so passing its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to the stars, and while it is waxing to fullness when kindled 
by the sun, the stars gradually send out their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and warmth, which they have received from the moon, into 
the air in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to warm it and strengthen it. The air exudes its moisture onto the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to make it 
fertile, so that when the moon is <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> again, the stars are again empty and ready to receive new <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and heat 
from it. And when the moon wanes, the stars are <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to strengthen the air and the earth. And the stars 
wane so that the moon will again be full. 


The purification by the airs 

But when the stars appear at night, then burning spheres and projectiles are sometimes seen flying in the air. 
The explanation is that the stars are sending their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy into the air in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to strengthen it, and the 
air then makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> fruitful with its heat. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> also the air is often seen purging itself with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and 
heat of the stars so that its impurities fall from it like dregs. 


The threads of the air 


Similarly, when summer and winter separate so that either summer recedes and winter arrives or winter recedes 
and summer arrives, then a certain mixed substance appears, flying in the air, like a whiteness of threads, where 
the air is purifying itself. This descends to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> owing to the collision of summer and winter, that is, when 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> seasons come into conflict with each other. 


Eclipses 

Sometimes an eclipse of the moon is seen when the elements and the storms collide as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they had a 
conflict among them. On these occasions the moon is darkened by the storms for a period rather than waning or 
being extinguished. But the force of the moon is such that it can overcome these storms and send out its 
splendour again, because the force of the moon is greater than the force of these storms. 

The five planets 

There are also five planets, which have their <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and from the ether; they are the support and 
strength of the firmament. They have their orbits in the heights and depths of the firmament where the sun’s 
rays do not reach and where its splendour is hardly shown. Wherever they are situated and wherever they move 
to they also serve the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> in its orbit, restraining the sun’s speed and causing its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to diminish in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> 
that because of the planets, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> does not send out such burning heat as it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> do if they did not restrain it. 
And just as the five senses of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> hold it <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> and are its ornaments, so also the five planets 
contain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and are its beauty. 


The retarding of the firmament 

The firmament revolves at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> speed, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> - with the other planets - moves a little more slowly in the

the firmament was motionless and did not turn, but after his fall it began to move and revolve. However, after 
the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> it will stay motionless just as it was at the first <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> before Adam. Now, however, it revolves for a 
reason: so that it is confirmed and strengthened by the sun, moon, and stars, for if it stood still it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> quickly 
soften, turn liquid, and flow away in all directions. Also, because it revolves gradually it is able to purify the 
elements, and this purification is what we see as black clouds bearing water; just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> placed in a pot over a

The music of the firmament 

In its revolving the firmament emits marvellous sounds, which we nevertheless cannot hear because of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

Preface 

All gemstones contain energy and moisture. They terrify the devil, who hates and despises them because he 
remembered that their beauty appeared in him before he fell from the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had given him, and also 
because some precious stones are <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy in which he himself has his punishments. It 
was in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> that the devil was defeated, through God’s will, and he fell into fire, just as he is also defeated

Precious stones and jewels have their origin in the East, and in those areas where the heat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is 
particularly strong. The mountains that occur in such areas have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat, like fire, which comes from the 
heat of the sun; similarly the rivers that flow in these regions are always boiling hot, due to the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat 
of the sun. Accordingly, when at times the rivers flood and break their banks, increasing in volume and rising up 
to the mountains that are burning with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat of the sun, and when these come into contact with the 
rivers, then, in those places where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> makes contact with the fire, they throw up a kind of foam, in other

on it. And so the foam hangs in those places like ‘glitten’ or glue, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> or four <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> hardens into 
stone. When the flood of waters has ceased and the waters have resumed their normal courses, then the drops 
of foam, which remain hanging at various locations in the mountains, are dried by the heat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> according

The stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> assume their 
colours and powers according to the temperature of the hour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at which they are formed, and once they 
have dried and hardened into precious stones, they drop like scales from their locations and fall into the sand. 
And when the rivers rise again in flood, they carry away the gemstones and deposit them in different regions, 
where eventually they are found by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings.

way, these mountains shine as bright as day. 

In this way, then, precious stones are made out of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and water; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> contain energy and moisture

There are other kinds of gemstones that do not originate in the mountains in the manner just described, but 
are produced from various other useless substances.

But just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> raised Adam to a better part, so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> allowed neither the

l. Smaragdus 

Smaragdus grows in the early morning at the rising of the sun, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> is powerfully placed in its circuit 
for the perfection of its journey, and when the grasses and greenness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> flourish at their best, for the 
air at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is still cold but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> already warm; and at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the herbs absorb the greenness as 
powerfully as a lamb sucking its milk so that the heat of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is barely enough to ripen and nourish the 
greenness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and make the plants fertile enough for the producing of fruit. 

Smaragdus is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> effective against all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> weaknesses and infirmities, because it is <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth by 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and because all its material springs from the greenness of the air. So for a pain in the heart, stomach, or 
side, carry smaragdus about you to warm the <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> of your body, and it will feel better. But if the illness strikes a 
<span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> so suddenly that they can barely withstand its attack, then they should immediately put the smaragdus 
in their mouth, so that it is moistened with saliva, and so that the saliva is warmed by the gemstone, and they 
should breathe in and out repeatedly. Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> doubt the sudden onsets of that illness will cease. 

And if someone falls in a fit of epilepsy, then - right where they are lying - <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a piece of smaragdus in 
their mouth, and their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> will revive. And after they have got up again and <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the stone from their mouth, 
they should look at it attentively and say: 

‘As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has fulfilled the circle of the earth, 

So may the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> be filled with his grace 
That it may never again be afflicted.’ 

They should repeat this again and again on the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> in the mornings, and they will be cured. But they 
should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care always to have the same stone about them and look at it every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in the early morning, and 
while they are looking at it they should say the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> given, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they will be healed. 

If you suffer from headache, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the stone in your mouth and warm it with your breath until it is moistened 
from your breathing, and stroke your temples and forehead with the wet stone; next, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the stone in your 
mouth and keep it there for a short hour, and you will feel better. 

For someone with too much ‘flecma’ and too much saliva: first, heat up some strong wine; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a linen cloth 
over a bowl, put a smaragdus stone on the cloth and pour the heated wine over the stone so that the wine strains 
through the cloth; repeat several times as for the preparation of a solution. Mix this wine with bean flour and 
<span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> often, and drink the prepared wine frequently. This will clear the brain and reduce the ‘flecma’ and saliva 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> it. 

For an attack of gnawing worms: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> a linen cloth over the ulcer with a smaragdus stone and tie other 
pieces of linen over it, as for the treatment of a swelling. The <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> this should be done is to warm the stone. 
Continue to do it for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> until the worms die. 

2. Hyacinth 

Hyacinth has its origins in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> at the first hour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> when the air is moderately warm, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> has more 
air than fire. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> senses the air and it changes according to the warmth of the air. Nevertheless it is also 
fire, because it is generated from fire. 

For someone suffering weakness of the eyes, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> vision is turbid, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> ‘swerent’ [hurt] - hold

Moisten it immediately in a little saliva and as quickly as possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it over the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> so that they are warmed 
by it. Repeat frequently and the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> will become clear and healthy. 

For anyone who is ‘bezaubert’ [bewitched] by fantasms or magic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and has gone out of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> : 1 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> 
a warm loaf of fine wheat and cut the shape of a cross through its top crust, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> breaking the loaf into 
pieces; draw the stone through the line of the cut on top and say: 


‘May God, who deprived the devil of every precious stone 

after he had broken his commandment, 

drive out from you, N., 

all fantasms and all magic spells, 

and may he release you from all the pain of this madness.’ 

And again, drawing the stone transversely through the bread, say: 

‘Just as the splendour which the devil had 
was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from him because of his transgression, 
so may this madness too, 

which oppresses you, N., through fantasms and through magic, 

be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from you, 

and may it depart from you!’ 

Then, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the bread around the line of the cut through which you have passed the hyacinth and give it to the 
suffering <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to eat. But if they cannot <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> this wheaten bread because of the debility of their body, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> 
unleavened bread, that is ‘derf brot’, and give it to them to eat. But also <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> the stone in cruciform through all 
the warm <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> that the patient eats, that is, through meat, ‘warmuse’ [cooked vegetables] and their other food, 
and cut crosses in it and bless it with the aforesaid words; do this frequently, and the patient will be cured. 

Also for anyone suffering pains in the heart: make the sign of the cross over their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> with the hyacinth and 
say the aforesaid words, and they will feel better. 


3. Onyx 

Onyx is warm and grows at the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> hour of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in thick cloud, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> burns powerfully but is 
covered by various rising clouds which prevent it from appearing through them because of their flood of waters. 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the stone does not hold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> heat of fire, but it has the warmth of the air, for its origin is in the root of the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and the conglutination of various clouds. Onyx <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> virtues against illnesses arising in the 
air. 

For dimness of the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> and the like, or anything due to ‘augswern’ [complaint of the eyes], <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> good, pure 
wine in a bronze, copper, or iron receptacle, add onyx to the wine and ‘beizze’ [steep] it for either fifteen or 
thirty days. Then remove the stone, leaving the wine in the receptacle, and touch the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> each night with a little 
of the wine; they will clear and become healthy. 

For pains in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> or sides, warm an onyx in your <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> or close to your body, also taking wine again and 
heating it in a vessel over a fire; then remove the wine from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and hold the onyx over the steaming wine 
so that the sweat coming from the stone mingles with the wine. Finally put the stone in the hot wine and drink 
it as it is, and the heat in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> or <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> will cease. 

For a complaint of the stomach, prepare wine with onyx as described and then prepare a ‘sufen’ [soup] from 
the wine with hen’s eggs and flour. Make and <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> this frequently; it will purify your stomach and make you 
healthy. For a complaint of the spleen, cook the meat of a goat or lamb, put the cooked meat in the wine and 
onyx mixture as described above and <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> the marinaded meat like those dishes made by marinading in vinegar. 
Do this frequently; the spleen will heal and the swelling stop. 

And for anyone who has a strong ‘fiber’ [fever] - <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the onyx in vinegar for fifteen days. Remove the stone, 
and with this vinegar flavour and season all your food; <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> prepared, and the ‘fiber’ will stop and fade 
easily, because the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> warmth of the onyx, mixed with the warmth of the vinegar, will drive out the noxious 
humours in which the fevers originate. 

If you are oppressed by melancholy, focus your attention on the onyx and then put it immediately into your

And if ‘schelme’ [cattle sickness] starts attacking and killing your cows, heat some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in a vessel over a 
fire; remove from the fire, hold an onyx over the steaming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to allow the sweat from the onyx to mix with it, 
and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the stone in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> days. Having removed the stone, give the cattle regular drinks of 



the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and sprinkle their feed with it; also, mix their bran with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and offer it them to eat; do this 
frequently and they will feel better. 


4. Beryl 

Beryl is a warm gemstone which develops, between the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> hour and midday, from the foam of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> when the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> burns it severely. Its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> more from air and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> than from fire, but nevertheless it has some of 
the properties of fire. And if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has drunk or eaten poison, then he should ‘schabe’ [place] a little of the beryl 
in ‘queckbronen’ [spring water] or other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and drink it at once. Continue for five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> drinking it once a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> 
while fasting, and the poison will foam up through vomiting, or it will <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> out of him through the rear. 

Whoever keeps a piece of beryl constantly about them, and frequently takes it in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and frequently 
focusses on it, will not easily argue with other people, nor will they be ‘stridig’ [quarrelsome], but they will 
remain calm. 


5. Sardonyx 

Sardonyx is warm, and grows each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> when the sixth hour has passed and when the first line of the ninth hour 
has gone by; at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is nourished by the pure sun, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> shines in its purity, because at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> begins to cool down; it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> contains more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> than air or water. It has strong powers in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> 
and gives a certain virtue to the five <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> senses and is a remedy for them, because it is <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">born</span> in the purity of 
the sun, when no impurity appears in the brightness of the sun. When someone places the stone on their bare 
skin and also puts it often in their mouth so that their breath touches it, then takes it out and puts it back in 
again, then this will strengthen their intellect and knowledge, and all the senses of their body. Consequently 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> anger, stupidity and indiscipline will be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from them, and because of their cleanness the devil will hate 
and flee them. And if by their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or woman is burning in carnal desire, then he should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the 
sardonyx on his ‘lanchen’ [loins] and the woman should put it on her umbilicum, and they will have a remedy 
for their libido. But if someone has suffered an acute ‘sucht’ [attack of fever], as soon as they have sweated out 
the fever and are feeling better, then put the stone in a ring on their finger and they will not suffer any relapse of 
the ‘sucht’. 


6. Sapphire [excerpt] 

Sapphire is warm; it grows around the midday period, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> burns so vigorously in its heat that the air 
becomes to a certain extent hazy, and then the sun’s splendour from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> quantity of heat which it has at 
that period passes through the air less readily and its splendour at that period appears not as fully as it does 
when the air has cooled a little. Sapphire is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> opaque and also more akin to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> than to air or water; and 
it signifies the <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of wisdom. 

A <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who has ‘vel’ in their eye should hold a sapphire in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and warm it there [or in a fire] and 
touch the ‘vel’ in his eye with the moist stone; continue to do this for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> every morning and night, and 
the ‘vel’ will diminish, and disappear. And if your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are red with pain and ‘seregent’ [hurt], or if your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> are 
weak, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the sapphire in your mouth while fasting and moisten it with saliva of the mouth and then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> 
the same saliva that has moistened the stone on your finger and apply it round your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> so that it also makes 
contact with the inside of your eyes; your <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> will heal and become clear. 

And for a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> who is completely ‘virgichtiget’ [suffering from gout] so that they cannot bear the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> 
pressure in their <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> and in the rest of their body, have them put the stone in their mouth, and the ‘gicht’ will 
cease. 



23. Songs from Symphonia 


The Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations was a collection of songs initially compiled in the 
middle period of Hildegard’s career between the completion of Scivias in 1151 and the beginning of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on The 
<span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits in 1158. Other songs were composed later and added to the collection, the fullest 
manuscript being that of the Riesenkodex of the 1180s. This translation of selected songs is based on the edition 
by Pudentiana Barth, M. Immaculata Ritscher and Joseph Schmidt-Gorg , Hildegard von Bingen. Lieder 
(Salzburg 1969), which follows the oldest manuscript, a compilation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> by Hildegard and Elisabeth that 
was sent to the monastery ofVillers during Hildegard’s lifetime and is now preserved as Codex 9 of the library 
of the monastery of Dendermonde, in Belgium. For ease of comparison, the notes give the numbering of the 
songs in the edition by Barbara Newman, Symphonia ( Ithaca , 1998 ).

Hail, Mary, author of life,

In her commentaries, apparently designed as homilies on the readings of the Gospel at particular church 
services and festivals during the Christian year, Hildegard allowed <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> rein to her allegorical interests, often 
with bold and innovative interpretations. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> homilies for Christmas reveal a strong Platonic vein in her 
thinking. In the first, the literal events of Luke’s Nativity narrative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> on added significance when seen in the

In the second, the events are internalized and interpreted in a 
new, psychological reading that complements the first. Both homilies illustrate the tendency in medieval 
reading to allow for different layers and levels of interpretation. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> does not have one but several

[2] This first description - <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> - was made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria; that is, by the Father’s Word,

[6] And it came to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> when they were there - that is, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being had gained discretion in his

ALLEGORIES OF JUSTICE AND <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">LOVE</span> 


25. The Iron Mountain (Scivias 1 , 1) 


One of Hildegard’s earliest visions - given prominence as the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and illustration in Scivias - depicts a 
bright figure seated on an iron mountain. On the literal level, it is a striking and often surreal picture, but it is 
also an allegory in which every detail has a corresponding <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> in the religious and moral life. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and 
iconogi'aphy make clear, what the picture represents is the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> figure enthroned above his kingdom. Other 
details add to the interpretation. At the foot of the mountain stand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> further allegorical figures. The first is 
<span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the Lord’, seen as a vaguely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> covered all over with the many <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of discernment, an idea 
that derives from Proverbs 1:7, ‘The <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge... ’ This is the sapiential <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> 
of Hildegard’s teachings, which she was to develop in the rest of her writing career. The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> figure is that of 
poverty of spirit’, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> face cannot be seen because of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> pouring down on her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> from the figure of 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> on the mountain. The picture <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> graphically illustrates the idea from Christ’s Sermon on the Mount: 
‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven’ (Matthew 5:3). This points to the ethically 
and socially engaged <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of Hildegard’s theology; again it is something that never leaves her, and it is still 
present at the end of her writing career some thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> later. 

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> other aspects of the vision described below should be noted. First, there are the sparks, representing the 
virtues, a recurring motif in her work. Secondly, there are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> types of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in the mountain, who 
symbolize, morally, the weak and the strong. In the explanations that follow, justice and the practice of justice 
emerge as the main themes of the vision, while in the opening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> Hildegard’s primary vocation as prophet 
and teacher is emphasized. 



[Scivias I, i] 


I saw the likeness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain the colour of iron, and on it sat a figure in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> brightness, so bright that 
it dazzled my eyes. Light-filled shadows stretched out on either side: they were wings of astounding breadth and 
height. And before this figure, at the roots of the mountain, there stood an image covered with eyes, and because 
of the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> I could not make out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> beneath. And in front of her was the figure of a child dressed 
in a pale tunic and white shoes. I could not see her face because of the bright <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> pouring down on her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> 
from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated on the mountain. But many living sparks sprang forth from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on the mountain and 
hovered round these figures most pleasingly. In the mountain itself many small windows were visible, at which 
there appeared the faces of men, some pale, some pure. 

And suddenly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated on the mountain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out in a loud and penetrating <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> and said: 

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Human</span> creature in your weakness, in the dust and ashes of the earth! Cry out and <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the entry to 
lasting salvation, so that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> may be taught who see the inner pith of the <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the writings but will 
not <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> or preach them! For they are lukewarm and sluggish in their keeping of God’s justice. Unlock the 
mysteries which they have so fearfully and fruitlessly concealed in a hidden field. 

Pour forth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> in a fountain of abundance; stream out in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of mysteries so that those 
who wish to hurt you because of Eve’s transgression will be struck by the force of your irrigating torrent. 

For you do not receive this profound and penetrating discernment from a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. Rather, you receive it 
from the heavenly and awe-inspiring Judge on high, where this <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> will shine forth with a clear bright radiance 
among the bearers of light. 

Rise up, therefore, cry out and <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> forth those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> made known to you by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> strength of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>

For the one who rules his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> with mercy and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> pours out the brightness of heavenly

I. The strength and stability of the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> 

‘I saw the likeness of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain the colour of iron, and on it sat a figure in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> brightness, so bright that 
it dazzled my eyes. Light-filled shadows stretched out on either side: they were wings of astounding breadth and 
height.’ 

The ‘great iron mountain’ which you see represents God’s <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> kingdom. In its strength and stability it can 
never be <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> down by change or mutability. The ‘man seated in the bright <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that dazzles your eyes’ is the 
one who rules all the circle of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> in the brightness of his unceasing glory. In his <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> divinity he can 
never be grasped by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> understanding. The ‘light-filled wings’ are the soft and gentle protection, the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> 
defence of warning and reproof, the just and pious demonstration of ineffable justice <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> 
equity. 


2. The <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> 

‘And before this figure, at the roots of the mountain, there stood an image covered with eyes, and because of the 
<span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> I could not make out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> beneath.’ 

The ‘image covered with eyes’ represents <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in the presence of God. She contemplates the 
kingdom of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in all humility. Covered with the discernment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and fair intentions, she practises 
enthusiasm and constancy in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> behaviour. And this is why you cannot see the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> beneath the 
cover of the discerning eyes: because her sharp-sighted gaze dispels all the obliviousness to God’s justice which 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> often feel in their jaded hearts. And her vigilance is such that it cannot be diverted by the 
weakness of mortal inquiry. 


3. The poor in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> 

The <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is followed by the poor in spirit: ‘And in front of her was the figure of a child dressed in a 
pale tunic and white shoes.’ 



In the devotion of humility, poverty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is held in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in her <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> by <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of the Lord. And she 
does not care for the elation or leap of the heart; instead she loves simplicity and sobriety of mind. In the pale 
colour of her tunic, she attributes her just deeds to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and not to herself - hence the pale colour also of her 
worshipful subjection - and she follows faithfully in the bright footsteps of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of God. 

‘I could not see her face because of the bright <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> pouring down on her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> seated on the 
mountain.’ 

He who worthily rules the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> floods the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and strength of that <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> with such 
radiance of presence that you cannot grasp it with the weak <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of mortal perception. For he who holds the 
riches of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> subjected himself in humility to the <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of poverty. 

4. How the virtues proceeding from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> protect the God-fearing and the poor in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> 

‘But many living sparks sprang forth from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on the mountain and hovered round these figures most 
pleasingly.’ 

Diverse and powerful virtues emerge like sparks of lightning from the all-powerful God. With their help and 
protection, they surround those who truly <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and those who truly <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> poverty of spirit. The virtues 
embrace them ardently and win them over. 

5. How people’s motivations cannot be hidden from God’s awareness 

‘In the mountain itself many small windows were visible, at which there appeared the faces of men, some pale, 
some pure.’ 

The <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> is this: people’s motivations cannot be concealed from the depth and profundity of God’s acute 
awareness. All too often they themselves either reveal their lack of warmth or manifest their purity. In their 
hearts and actions, some tire themselves out and fall asleep in disgrace, while others spur themselves on and 
remain vigilant in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> honour. 


6. Solomon on the same topic 

Solomon testifies in a similar way, according to my will, saying: ‘He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack 
hand: but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of the diligent maketh rich.’ 1 

This means that if <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> do not practise justice and if they refuse to stamp out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> or cancel their debts, they 
will become weak and poor. In their idleness they will remain apart from the marvellous workings of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> 
favour. But as for those who practise powerful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of salvation and run on the path of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> - they will reach 
the springing fountain of glory, from which they will gain the precious riches of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and heaven! 


26. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> Looking East and South (from The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I) 


The main focus of the six visions of The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits (1158-63) is the ‘Man.’ The <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> symbolic and 
allegorical significance of this figure is made clear as the author moves on to the explanation and exegesis of 
her vision in the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> half of each vision (for an excerpt, see 28). 

Part One: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> Looking East and South 

And I saw 1 a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> of such stature that from the tops of the clouds in the sky he reached down into the abyss; so 
that from above his shoulders he was <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> than the clouds in the bright ether, and from below his shoulders 
down to his thighs he was beneath the clouds in another white cloud; from his thighs to his knees he was in the 
earthly air, from his knees to the calves of his legs in the earth, and from his calves to the soles of his feet in the 
waters of the abyss (but in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that he also stood above the abyss). He had turned towards the East, so 

that he looked 2 both East and South. 

Now his face shone with such splendour that I could not perfectly see it. The white cloud was near his mouth 
in the likeness of a trumpet, <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of the rapid soundings of all musical sounds, and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> blew a breath, 
it sent out <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> winds: one bore a cloud of fire; one bore a cloud of storms; one bore a cloud of light. And each 
cloud was supported by its wind. 

While the wind bearing the cloud of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> remained before the man’s face, the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> winds descended with 
their clouds to his chest, and there they expanded their breath outwards. But the wind that had stayed before the 
man’s face extended its cloud from the East to the South. 

In the cloud of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> were myriads of fiery beings; and they were all one life, in one will and one conjunction. 
And in their presence a writing tablet^ was laid out, filled with feathers. The <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">tablet</span> soared in the precepts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> 

when the precepts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> bore it aloft. And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God4 had inscribed hidden mysteries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it 
which the myriads of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> observed with one unified devotion. And when they had studied what was <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> 

the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> virtue came <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them and like a single mighty trumpet they sounded forth with one soundS in all 
varieties of music. 

Now the wind bearing the aforesaid storm cloud dispersed it from the South to the West, in length and 
breadth like a road greater than any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> intellect could comprehend. And in the cloud were a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> 
of <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> beings; they all had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in them and no one could possibly count them. Their voices were 
like the sound of many waters, and they said: ‘We have our habitations, just as the maker of the wind desired; 
but when will we finally receive them? If we had them with us, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rejoice more fully than we do now.’ 

But the aforementioned 1 multitude of <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the aforesaid cloud of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> answered them in a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of praise 
saying: ‘When the Deity takes hold of his trumpet, he will send forth thunder, lightning, and flaming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

Then, with the trumpet blast, he will <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> out to all the nations from 

all the varieties of the tongues of the earth; and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you will receive your habitations.’? 

And the wind bearing the aforesaid cloud of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> extended it from the East to the North. But an immense

and the goat will wage war against the North.’ 

And there was in the aforementioned darkness a countless <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of lost souls, who had turned away from 
the singing of the <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in the South, for they did not wish to be their companions.

fled from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and moves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> us towards death!’ 

Next I saw a cloud coming from the North , 10 reaching towards the darkness. It was arid and joyless, for the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> had neither touched it nor shown itself to it. It was <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> spirits which wandered back and forth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> 
it scheming plots against humanity, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they blushed for shame in the presence of the Man. 

And I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the ancient serpent 11 say to himself: ‘I will prepare all my forces of strength and wage war 
against my enemies with all I can muster!’ 

And he sent forth from his mouth among humankind the froth of his many impurities, and with them his 
vices, and he inflated them with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mockery, and he said: ‘Ha! They <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> themselves suns for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of 
their works, but I will turn them into noxious terrors of the night!’ 

And he blew out a poison cloud which covered all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> like black smoke, and from it came a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> roar, 
saying: ‘Let no one honour a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> they cannot see and know! How can they worship what they cannot know!’ 

In the black cloud I saw the images of many kinds of vices ; 12 seven of which I considered, in the following 
manner. 


27. The Seven Vices and Virtues (from The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I) 


In the following psychomachia, or ‘battle of the soul’, the various vices and virtues are personified and 
endowed with characteristics based on aspects of the human, animal, plant, demonic or angelic spheres of life. 
They <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> and act, and have different personalities, and in the subsequent exegesis they are given names, 
usually based on abstract nouns or concepts, such as the first vice, ‘Love of the World’, and his/her opponent, 
the virtue ‘Heavenly Love’ Unlike the mainstream tradition of the Psychomachia of Prudentius, in which all the 
personifications are female, in Hildegard the gender of these figures is hinted at but not formally stated. In the 
<span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the first image, it seems best, from the context of the description given, to picture the figure as a man, 
perhaps a medieval ‘wild man’ with some of the characteristics of the inhabitants of the margins of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> 
(Ethiopia was on the edge of medieval maps), as described for instance in such medieval <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> as The Wonders 

of the East 1 or Mandeville’s Travels. 


The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I 


1. The first figure had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the blackness of an Ethiopian, and he stood naked, grasping round 
a tree below the branches with his arms and his legs. The tree flourished with all kinds of blossom, and he 
gathered the flowers to him with his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and said: 

‘I hold all the kingdoms of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with all their flowers and adornments. So why dry up when I possess all 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of greenness? Why live in senile old age, when I can flourish in youthfulness? Why keep in the dark the 

beautiful vision of the eyes? If I did that, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> blush for shame! 2 Give me the beauty of this world, and I will 
hold it with joy! All other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is unknown to me! The fables I hear of it are meaningless!’ 

When he had said this, the aforesaid tree dried up to the roots and plunged into the darkness, and the figure 
fell with it. 

2. And from the aforesaid storm-cloud I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> respond to the first figured 

‘This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> foolishness, for you <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a spark in the ashes; and you do not seek that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> 
which never fades with the beauty of youth, and never weakens in old age. You lack all light, you are in 
blackness and darkness, wound up in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> self-will like a worm; you live for the moment, then dry up like 
hay! You fall into the lake of perdition, and there have your end with all you embrace, which in your present 
<span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> you <span class="t3 t11 t18 t27 hoverable">call</span> your flowers! 

‘I am a column of celestial harmony; I direct all the joys of life. I do not scorn life, but I trample all hateful 
things, and I disparage you. For I am the mirror of all virtues, in which the faithful may see themselves clearly. 
But you run the paths of the night! Your <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> are busy with failure!’ 

The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> figure had the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a hunting-dog, trained to course for his prey.4 He stood on his hind legs, 
reaching up with his front paws round an upright staff, and his tail wagged playfully as he said: 

3. ‘What is happiness for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and what moves him moderately to laughter? Is there not a beautiful breath in 
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and should he not be a harmony of sound? What is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who is constantly preoccupied with 
mortality? A nobody! So let him be happy while he can be happy.’ 

4. And again from the storm-cloud I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a voiced give a response to the image: 

‘You criminal! You are like the wind blowing about in the squalid manners of playful men, but in your 
fickleness you are like the worms digging up the ground. For when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> see you, they fall in with you, and you 
run to greet them like a dog; in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you persuade them to want only what they desire. You proffer your 
useless and criminal words, and you strike a wound in the hearts of men. You frame your deeds according to the 
letter of the law, and so you catch <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> more easily. 

‘But I am the belt of sanctity and the cloak of honesty. I am an honoured guest at the nuptials of the king. 
There I attend in joy and discipline, and there I appear in all the trappings of righteousness.’ 

The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> figure resembled a man, except that he had a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> crooked nose, his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were the paws of a bear, 
and his feet were like the claws of a gryphon. He had black hair, and was dressed in pale clothing. ^ 

5. He said: ‘It is better to be playful than sad. Play is not wickedness! Do not all who know <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> rejoice and sing? 
The heavens and all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> are <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> of joy; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I too will rejoice! If I appeared sad before my fellows, they 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> hate me and shun me. I will do no such thing! I will try the many kinds of play - may all have their joy 
with me! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> the air which carries sweet sounds to me, the air which brings me the greenness of 
flowers, the air where I feast on all the sights of my eyes! Why should I not rejoice in all these things? Humans 
with animals and animals with humans; all of them play and amuse themselves together. This is as it should 
be!’ 

6. And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloudh 

‘You are idolatry, since you act in all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> according to your self-will, and you will be a dead sound made by 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> hand. Your will is both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> and animal since your behaviour is sometimes human, sometimes 


animal. But all your behaviour is based not on living but on dead creatures, since you reach out for what you 
desire, and you walk in the paths of whim and vanity. 

‘But I blush at all this, I hide under the wings of the cherubim; I learn the mysteries of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the books and 
commandments of God, and in all heavenly matters I am vitality. For I see with the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of the innocent, and 
everywhere by the practice of honesty I discern the will of God, from which you flee in your unseeing 
ignorance!’ 

The fourth figure was like a dense cloud of smoke in the shape of a man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it did not have any limbs of 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> except for large black <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> that appeared within; it moved neither up nor down, nor from <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> to 

side, but remained in the aforesaid darkness, motionless. ^ 

7. And it spoke: 

‘I have designed nothing and <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> nothing. So why should I labour for any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> cause? Why tear myself to 

pieces?^ I will do no such thing! I will concern myself with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> only if they profit me. Let <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> who <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> 
everything decide and provide for everything! And if I make smooth-sounding talk, inquire into the affairs of 
others, how will it benefit me? I will do them no harm, but I won’t do them any good! For if I had so much 
compassion in me that I could not get any rest, where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> I be then? And what kind of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> I lead if I 
had to respond to every <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of happiness or sorrow? I only know myself: all the others should do the same!’ 

8. And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the aforementioned storm-cloud: 10 

‘You creature of stone! What are you saying? The plants and flowers proffer scents to other plants; the stone 

presents its moisture 11 to other stones; every creature extends embraces to its fellows. All creatures serve the

But you are not worthy of 
receiving even the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being! All you have in you are cruel <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> with no mercy! You are a bitter 
cloud of smoke in the malignity of darkness! 

‘But I am in the air and dew; I am sweet herb in all greenness. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> is full, ready to grant any kind of 
assistance, for I was present in that first Let there be out of which all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> proceeded that now do

‘With my <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> I survey all needs; I unite myself to them; I lead all the broken back to health; I am a healing

The fifth figure appeared to have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> head, except that his <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> ear was like the ear of a hare and so big that 

it covered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> head. 12 The rest of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> resembled the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a worm, a boneless creature wound up 
in its lair like an infant wrapped in cloths. 

9. Trembling with fear, it spoke: ‘I will not cause injury to anyone, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I will not become an exile

For if I were to injure others, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> jeopardize my present standing and be

cannot <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> me profit. 

‘I wish to be peaceful to all, so that I will not perish. For if I fight with anyone, they will perhaps strike back; 
and if I do someone an injury, they will do me a greater one. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as I am among <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> I will remain at

For it is better for me occasionally to lie 
and deceive rather than tell the truth; it is better also to gain rather than lose, and to flee the strong rather than 
fight against them. Where indeed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the profit in starting something that I could not finish? The 
victorious and the <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> make fun of me. But let them have what they have; for my part, I will have the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>

killed.’ 

10. And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: 1 ^ ‘In the first error of speaking against

whatever you <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> and gather to yourself is mean and paltry.

For I fight against the ancient 
serpent, and I destroy all his spoils with the mystery of the scriptures of God, in which I always contend against 
the missile showers of the enemy; and so I remain, in the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> God.’ 

The sixth figure had the face of a man, except that his mouth was like the mouth of a scorpion and the white of 
his <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> stood out around his pupils; his arms also resembled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> arms, but his crooked <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> 
claws; he had the chest, stomach and back of a crab, and his feet and legs were like those of locusts and vipers. 
He stood entangled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the spokes of a mill-wheel with his <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> grasping the upper spokes of the wheel and 
his feet resting on the lower spokes. There was no hair on his head, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was bare. But from his 

mouth he emitted many flames of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> like burning brands. 1 4 

n. And he said: ‘I trample and overthrow all that cause me harm. Should I merely tolerate any injury? What you 
do not wish to be done to you, do not do to me! Whoever does me harm I stab with my sword and strike with my 
clubs!’ 

12. And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: ^ ‘I have sounded in the heights and 
touched the earth; I have exuded healing balm from the earth. But you are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> deception! You are a drinker of

‘But I am a mild breeze of all greenness, bringing forth flowers and fruits of all virtues, establishing them

no one down but hold everything in peacefulness, and no one condemns me. But when you build a tower, I

From below his loins he resembled a goat, but his feet were so deep in the aforesaid darkness that I could not 

perfectly make them out. He also wore no clothes and appeared quite naked. 1 

13. And he spoke: ‘A sweet <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and a beautiful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> me.

seems hard and black in appearance, but afterwards it shines like gold - so likewise if there is any tarnish to my 
flesh, it is not reprehensible. There are many in the blindness of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> who do not know what they are doing. 
For my part, I know this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and I intend to keep it!’ 

14. And again I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: ‘You naked creature! Why do you not 
blush with shame in mistaking a blind and mute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> for that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in which there is no darkness of night? In your

‘But I know that this worldly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will dry up like hay; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> I sigh for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that will not fail. I draw to me 
the harmony of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and all the angelic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> joys; I can never have my fill, for I have my fellowship with 
them, and I will never depart from them.’ 

15. And I saw that the aforementioned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> had drawn a three-edged sword and fixed it to his neck by the hilt, 
and he swept it back and forth, ready to strike. And the sword spoke: 

‘As Zeal of all zeal, I wage war against the North Wind and all who inhabit it! Who can withstand me in the 
fight? No one! For I am not formed of <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> coming <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in conjunction. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> with woman did not

Hildegard was at pains to emphasize that in her visions and prophecies she not only saw unknown images and 
mysteries but also <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> their interpretation as a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> speaking to her. What is not always clear 
in The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is where the modern editor or translator is to punctuate the text. 
Where does the ‘voice from heaven’ actually finish speaking? The answer to this is uncertain, and perhaps 
deliberately so. The <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> merges with the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> visionary and exegete. But 
Hildegard is serious about her visionary experiences, and she relates them to the experience told in Paul’s Letter 
to the Corinthians of how a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> up to the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> where he <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> ‘hidden words, which it is

16. Then I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> saying:

not through their own ability but through the permission of God, for it is he who <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> them. And since

29. The Unknown Language 


The Unknown Language ( Latin Lingua ignota) presents something of a puzzle. It was compiled in the middle 
period 0/1151-8, before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> began on The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits. As in many medieval glossaries, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> 
are classified rather like a thesaurus, and arranged in a hierarchical list beginning with expressions for God, 
angel and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, and finishing with the names of trees, plants, herbs and animals. For an impression of 

the style of the language, the following examples are of interest: 1

suggested that it was a secret language for communication between the nuns at the Rupertsberg. Alternatively, 

as a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits indicates, 3 it may have been purely a sacred language, and this

In a song on the dedication of a 
church, Hildegard replaces standard Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> with her own expressions from the lingua ignota. Although

30. Allegorical Letters 


The six letters selected here illustrate varying aspects of Hildegard’s allegorical method. The first and possibly 
the earliest of the six, an admonitory letter to the imperial supporter Hermann of Constance, uses the imagery 
of pruning garden plants to remind the bishop of his duties, while the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> letter, to a provost at Averbode, 
develops a more traditional image of the pastor as shepherd of his sheep. In both cases Hildegard’s message 
comes from the ‘living light’ or ‘secret light’ of her visionary experience. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> letter, to an abbess, is a 
response to a more personal query, but nevertheless turns the ‘lion’ of a biblical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> into a challenging 
allegorical figure. In her message to the papal supporter Eberh ard of Salzburg Hildegard sends her advice, 
encouraging the bishop (like Gregory the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> before her) to divide his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> equally between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> 
reflection and pastoral action. As in the letters to Abbot Adam and PiiorDimo that follow, Hildegard develops 
personified allegoi'ical figures, the maidens Love, Humility and Obedience; these are virtues and powers who 
stand at the threshold of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind, waiting for an invitation to lend their strength and assistance.

are directed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> under your authority. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> is that you regard the brightness of your efforts as 
something personal to you. The shadows of your labours, on the other hand, you regard as something foreign to 
you. You do not allow yourself to mix the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> activities and so you frequently feel a tiredness in your soul. And 
you do not realize that your efforts towards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and your labours in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are equally valid. 

In fact, when you pant with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> effort for heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and when you exercise God’s pastoral care for the 
people, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> can be connected in the one reward.

turned his attention to the people. As it is written: ‘You are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and all of you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of the most High. ’7 In other 
words, you are ‘gods’ in heavenly matters and ‘sons of the most High’ in the pastoral care of the people. 

Therefore, father, let the fountain of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> flow through your labours, the fountain from which <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> and

But Obedience also speaks to you: I will live with you, because you keep the laws and commandments of God.

Again, O father, <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> speaks to you: Be like the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of a household, who gently listens to the

immanence as embodied in a figure who is at once Love, <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> and Power. Its nearest equivalents are the 
sapiential ti'adition of the Old Testament Apocrypha, notably <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> of Solomon 7-8, and its theme is 
summed up in Ecclesiasticus 24:1, which states that ‘Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> in the midst 
of her people’.

1.

figure; her face was of such beauty and brightness that I could more easily have stared at the sun. On her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> 
she had a broad band of gold. And in that golden band above her <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> there appeared a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> face, like an old 
man, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> chin and beard touched the top of the first head. Wings protruded from behind the neck of the 
figure on either side, and rising up clear of the golden band their tips met and joined overhead. On the right, 
above the sweep of the wing, was an image of an eagle’s head, and I saw it had <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in which there 
appeared the brilliance of angels as in a mirror. On the left, above the sweep of the wing, was the image of a

But from each of her shoulders, a wing extended down to the knee. And she wore a tunic like the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and in her <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> she carried a lamb like the bright <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of day. But beneath her feet she trampled a monster 
of dreadful appearance, black and venomous, and also a serpent, which had fixed its teeth into the right ear of 
the monster and wound the rest of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> across its own head, and had stretched its tail on the <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> side. 

2. The figure spoke: I am the supreme <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and energy. I have kindled all the sparks of the living, and I have

32. Queries and Requests: Selected Letters to Hildegard 


In the twelfth century, writing a letter was rather like composing a speech. The main intended effect was aural, 
and the purpose was to convey the spoken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> by another medium, so that the recipients of the letter could 
hear ‘the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the absent person’ who had composed it. When it was received, the letter was read out loud, 
so that all present, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> literate or not, could participate in its message. 

The communal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the letter meant that its style was oral and rhetorical, with a conventional 
structure of salutation, exordium, narration, petition and conclusion. Hildegar’s first letter, for instance, the 
appeal to Bernard of Clairvaux (which has already been considered for its content in the Introduction) , could 
be analysed structurally along these lines, and more examples of conventionally structured letters are found 
below. At least in theory, the opening of the letter, the salutation, had to obey a rule whereby the names of 
sender and recipient were placed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> of seniority. The exordium that followed then <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the tone for the 
letter, with a suitable biblical quotation or moral to capture the attention of the recipient(s). 

If the sender was an important writer, then the letter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be valued very highly both in itself, as a token of 
the friendship of the sender, and also for its message and content. This phenomenon is partly to be explained by 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and expensive process involved in sending a letter. The message was first dictated to a scribe, who 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> notes on his wax tablet, translate the letter if necessary, and then transcribe it onto parchment. It 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then be delivered: important bishops and abbots had their own messengers, but otherwise the letter 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to await the arrival of a carrier already travelling in the same direction. Naturally this led to delays in 
the receipt of letters, and a corresponding value was attached to them when they finally arrived. Sometimes 
private messages were also conveyed by the bearer of the letter to ensure that they did not reach the wrong ears. 
Often when a letter was composed for posterity, a copy was retained before the original was sent, and an 
important author <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have his or her letters gathered, edited and in some cases rewritten for the final 
collection. 

As far as Hildegard’s correspondents are concerned, most are important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of her day, perhaps not 
surprising when we recall that she was a member of an established noble family from Bermersheim. She was 
frequently approached with specific requests, for instance for <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> of sermons she had preached, or for advice 
on particular matters. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the subject-matter of letters to Hildegard is usually spiritual, it also concerns 
political matters, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> of Church or state; in the present selection there are allusions to the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Crusade, 
the Synod of Trier, the Council ofRheims, and the schism between pope and emperor, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to abuses and

the wars and disturbances of the schism. Other correspondents 1 include an abbess <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> an abbey (Gertrud),

so beautifully. But if this does not happen, because of my sins, I trust in his goodness that he will not frustrate 
my hope of allowing me to see you there, where we will never be separated from his sight. 

What more is there to say? I ask you, dearest mother, to pray for me to him in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> embraces you remain

An Abbess of Altena to Hildegard, before 1173 [Letter 49] 

To the lady and mother Hildegard, loving and worthy in Christ, intimate with his love, from N., the Abbess of 

Altena, although undeserving, a penitent sinner sitting with Mary at the feet of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> 2 3 and hoping to see her 
loved one just as he is. 

I wish you joy in your <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> state, most loved of all women. As can be proved by your most evident delights, 
you have found the One whom your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> loves as much as is possible for mortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to do.

happy times with him now in the secret chamber of your heart, 2 4 you have tasted and seen that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> is 
sweet. 2 5 

I realize that I must bear with equanimity that although I am so devoted to you, you have neglected to visit 
me with your letters. For I believe that if you could avert the eye of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> for a moment from the

each other forever and we will earn the right to contemplate our beloved face to face 2 in all beauty.

Abbot Adam to Hildegard, before 1166 [Letter 85 ] 3 * 

To the lady, his beloved mother, Hildegard, mistress of the sisters at Rupertsberg in Bingen, from brother Adam, 
although unworthy, of Ebrach. I write what little I can. 

When I first received the fame of your name, I rejoiced with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> joy.3 2 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> increased my joy when, with a

in our land.33 And he allowed me something I had scarcely been able to hope for, namely a meeting and 
conversation with you. At our meeting, as I expect you remember, I told you of my anxiety. And because 
different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> feel different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> - some having this experience, others that - if my prosperity and salvation

On your behalf now, I am sending a messenger with a letter to the Emperor. And I hope by the grace of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span>

We pray also that you will be able to pray for us, for we are tossed by a storm of worry for our brothers. We 
pray that the grace of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> many wonders in you by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of prophecy, will also look

and she made known many other secrets with prophetic spirit. 

It is also known how elegantly she replied to letters sent to her from diverse places, if anyone wished to

Who is not amazed that she published songs with the sweetest melody in marvellous harmony?” And she

Indeed she wrote to Pope Hadrian about this <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> that in the heavenly vision she had <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the following 
said : ‘Since what you were shown from above you do not reproduce in the Latin language of common usage, 
since this skill has not been given you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> he who has the file should not neglect to perfect it to a sound

2 . It seems appropriate at this point to insert some writings from Hildegard’s visions and show on the basis of 
these <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">texts</span> how appropriately the saying from the Song of Songs can be applied to her: ‘My beloved put his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> 

through the opening of the door, and I trembled to the core of my being.’ 10 These writings are as follows. 

First vision: In the mystical vision, she says, and in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> from <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> which never fades I <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span>

Five tones of justice, sent to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race by God, sound forth, in which the salvation and redemption of

The first tone was perfected by the action of the faithful <span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> of Abel, which he <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to God; the

which was the circumcision of Abraham.

all those whom the serpent’s counsel had caused to be lost. But the fifth tone is perfected when all error and

When in my first formation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> roused me in my mother’s womb with the breath of life, he fixed this gift of 
visions in my soul. For, by the year 1100 after the incarnation of Christ, both the teaching of the apostles and the 
burning justice which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> had established in Christian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women were beginning to grow slow and 
inconstant. 

It was in these times that I was born, and with sighs my parents dedicated me to God. And in my <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> year I 
saw such a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> that my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> trembled; but because of my young age I could not put it in words. At the 

age of eight, I was offered to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> ; 11 and until I was fifteen I saw numerous visions and 
spoke many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> about them in a simple <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> so that those who <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> them were amazed at where they could 
have come from or who they were from. 

Then I in turn was amazed at myself, because when I saw these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in the depths of my soul, I still had the 
outward <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of my eyes; and I was amazed that I did not hear of such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> happening to anybody else. So I 
concealed the vision that I had in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as much as I could. Of the outside <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> I knew very little, because I 
had been so frequently ill from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of my mother’s milk until now. My <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was weakened by the illness 
and my strength had failed. 

Exhausted by all this, I asked a nurse of mine <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> she could see anything else apart from external 
objects. 

‘Nothing,’ she replied, since she could not see any of these other things. 

Immediately I was gripped with a terrible fear, and I did not dare reveal the experience of these visions to 
anyone else. 

Nevertheless, I <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> to predicting future events, sometimes speaking many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and sometimes having 
them <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> down in writing. And when I was completely steeped in the vision I spoke many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that were 
very strange to those who were listening. But when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the vision had lessened, then I behaved more 
in the character of a child than of someone of my years; I was terribly ashamed, and often wept, and on many 
occasions I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> much rather have kept quiet if I had been allowed to. 

Because of the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> that I felt towards other people, I did not dare tell anyone actually how I saw my visions; 
but a certain woman of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> rank to whom I had been sent for my upbringing became aware of this and revealed 
it to a monk that she knew. 

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> filled this woman with his grace like a channel of many waters, so that she gave her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> no rest from 
vigils, fasting and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> until she worthily ended her present life, the merits of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has made 
plain with various beautiful signs. After her end I continued to see visions until the fortieth year of my life. 

Then, in the same experience of a vision, I was compelled by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> pressure of pains to make known what I

But then my veins and marrow became filled with powers I had lacked in my childhood and youth. 

I intimated these experiences to the monk who was my teacher. A reliable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> standing in the 
cloistered life, he was like a pilgrim from the coarseness of behaviour of many men. Willingly he listened to my

what they were and where they might be from. But thinking that they might <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be from God, he intimated this 
to the abbot, and from then on he eagerly worked with me at writing them down. 

In that same vision I understood the writings of the prophets, evangelists and other saints, and certain 
philosophers, although I had not had any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> instruction, and I expounded some of their writings, although 
I hardly had any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of letters, because an uneducated woman had taught me. But also I composed and 
sang songs with melodies in praise of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and the saints, again <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> instruction, although I had

of many, and he himself read them out. And trusting fully in the grace of God, he sent me to put into writing, 
more attentively than I had before, all those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that I had seen and heard.

35* From the Canonization Protocol 


In the thirteenth century, just as the need arose for Hildegard’s sanctity to be confirmed, the process of official 
papal recognition of a saint became more rigorous and discriminating. In this new development, the procedure 
for canonization was entrusted to a special commission, which arranged interviews with those who had 
known the saint during his or her lifetime or with those who had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of miracles reported to have <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> due to the saint’s influence. The canonization protocol for Hildegard herself was compiled 
during the pontificate of Pope Gregory IX (1227-41). The first protocol was completed in 1233 but rejected for 
the lack of corroborating influence, especially the lack of reliable names of interviewees or of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> reported to 
have been cured by Hildegard’s influence. A <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> protocol was commissioned in 1237 and finished by 1243, 
but there is no evidence that it actually reached Rome; perhaps the prelates of Mainz, the diocese under which 
Hildegard’s monastery fell, decided to abandon the case. In the end, therefore, the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> for Hildegard’s sanctity 
was decided unofficially by the popular devotion of local Rhineland churches, and today Hildegard features as 
the focus of devotion in a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of well-known locations, notably of course in Eibingen and Disibodenberg. 

In the following extracts from the canonization protocol, the accompanying letter is addressed to Pope 
Gregory IX by the delegates of the commission, Gerbod, Walter and Arnold of Mainz. The delegates in turn cite 
Gregory’s letter in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> before continuing with the actual findings of the commission.

mentioned monastery, and because Hildegard, who did not study any writings other than the Psalter, composed 
many books, by the revelation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, worthy of notice to the Roman Church; and because we have 
<span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of her praiseworthy and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> while we were working in a lesser office and were sent as legates

2.3. ‘Alight in the darkness should not be concealed, nor a town on a mountain be hidden. Whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> has

3. With the mandate of his authority, and having travelled in <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> to the monastery of Saint Rupert, we 
received the faithful witnesses with questions on the life, behaviour, reputation, merits, signs and other 
circumstances of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard, rejecting a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> many witnesses, since no more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> could be had for

4.1. The Abbess of Rupertsberg 1 in Bingen, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Elisa, testified under oath to the miracles of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> 
Hildegard. She said that she saw how Mechthild, from the village of Lebenheim, was freed from demon 
possession at Hildegard’s grave. She also saw how the noblewomen Reguwize and Seguwize were freed from 

demons in the same manner in the actual presence of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard. 2 Afterwards they both served all 
their lives in the same monastery. She also saw several epileptics healed at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> (as for their names, 

these are unknown, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> knows). Likewise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> suffering from a tertian or quartan fever 3 were healed 
by the invocation of Hildegard’s name at her tomb (their names are unknown because so much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has 
passed). Agnes the Prioress gave the same <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> under oath, as did the sister of the abbess. Also, the 
custodian Beatrix, Odilia the cellarer and Hedwig the lay sister claim under oath to have seen the same things. 

4.2. The priest Rorich says the same under oath, but he added that when he came to exorcize the possessed 
woman Mechthild, and even before he had spoken to her, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> out his double name ‘Heinrich-Rorich’, 
which had been unknown to them in those parts before that day. He also saw four ravens sitting at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in 
the windows inside the church. When he asked the demoniac Mechthild who the ravens were, she replied saying 
that they were the demon’s companions waiting for him to be driven out. Having said this, she opened her 
mouth and breathed out a cloud of black smoke. In this way, the possessed woman was freed, and at once the 

ravens disappeared. The more reasonable part4 of the convent testify to the same under oath. 


4-3- He also adds that he saw eighteen demoniacs freed by the invocation of the same virigin’s name before her 
tomb (their names and places of origin are not known). The priest Daniel says the same under oath, as does the 
provost. When, in the course of questions, the abbess was asked about the timing, she said that all these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> 
had happened thirty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> previously. 

[•••] 

9.1. The same [healing of demoniacs and epileptics] is told under oath by Hedwig of Alzey, and she adds that the 
<span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard was constantly in bed because of God’s scourge, until she was enlightened by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, 

and then, walking through the convent, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> feel moved to sing the sequence O virga ac diadema .5 The 
custodian and the female cellarer agree with this under oath. 

9.2. [Hedwig of Alzey] again says that she saw a burning candle on the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard’s grave when a mass 
for the dead was being sung. After it was extinguished and the reading of the Gospel was begun, the candle was 
found to have lighted itself again, not once, but several times. 

9.3. She also saw a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> (whose name is unknown) insane, bound, and possessed by a demon, and several 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> held him by force on top of Hildegard’s grave. But in the end he freed himself from their <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and 
plunged into the river Nahe, which is at the foot of the mountain. And when most of the bystanders <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">thought</span> that 
he was dead, by the invocation of the grace of this virgin he was pulled out of the river alive. He confessed that 
he had been freed of the demon and he said that he had been protected from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> by the sleeve of the 
<span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> virgin Hildegard. Public opinion in Bingen agrees that this happened, as does the greater part of the 
convent, under oath. 

[...] 

11.4. [The abbess] learned also that a certain noble lady of Trier (whose name is unknown) had gone mad 
through the magic of a certain young man, with the result that she was completely out of her mind. Her parents 
were grieving, and <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> refuge with the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard, seeking her grace. Hildegard <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> bread from her 
table, <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> it and gave it to the sick girl, who immediately tasted it and was cured. This miracle was seen by 
Odilia the cellarer and Hedwig the lay sister (as they swore under oath), who were both sitting at the table with 
the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard. 

12.1. Likewise, when a certain man, who had been unjustly excommunicated, was buried at her monastery, and 
when, because of this, the Church of Mainz suspended the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> services and ordered that he be removed, she 
(the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard) made the sign of the cross over his grave with her staff so that his tomb could no longer 
be found. 

[...] 

12.3. Likewise, when the Bishop of Mainz, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Christian, was received in Bingen with the ringing of all the 
bells, Hildegard understood the bells sounding in the following way. One bell rang out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> ‘Shepherd, 
mourn!’ while the other rang ‘Flee quickly to your salvation!’ These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> seemed to be addressed to the 
Bishop. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> bell rang out in the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the Bishop: ‘I will depart and leave this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">land</span> in confusion.’ She 
said these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to the nuns who were present when she was in the spirit. This is confirmed under oath by 
Prioress Agnes, custodian Odilia, Sophia and several others. 

14.1. Bruno, custodian and priest at St Peter’s in Strasbourg, speaks under oath of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> 
Hildegard, according to what he has <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of her public reputation, and according to what he has read in the 
little <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of her Life, which, when the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> virgin died, was <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> immediately after her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> 
monks Gottfried and Theoderich. 


14.2. He believes that this contains the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in all aspects, namely, that she originated from noble parents, that 


when she was five she saw a cow and said to her nurse: ‘Look how beautiful the calf is inside the cow, all white 
with dark patches on his forehead, feet and back!’ The astonished nurse immediately told Hildegard’s mother of 
this. Her mother commanded the woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> cow it was to show her the calf as soon as the cow gave birth. 
When this was all done as the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard had predicted, her mother realized that it was true. Her parents 
were amazed, and seeing that she had a different character from other people, they decided to enclose her in a 
monastery. When she was eight, they dedicated her as an oblate to serve the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> in Disibodenberg under the 
rule of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Benedict, entrusting her to a certain recluse named Jutta, the sister of the Count of 
Spanheim. 

14.3. Concerning her monastic vocation, he says that her reputation for sanctity spread widely and very many 
girls of noble family streamed to her. But when the anchorage building could not contain them all, she was 
admonished by the Lord, and indeed compelled, to move to the Rupertsberg. How she conveyed the news to the 
Abbot through her confessor and how he received it badly; how she miraculously obtained permission, moved to 
the location shown to her by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and built a monastery there in that unfamiliar place; how she began to serve 
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> there with eighteen girls of noble family: all this is found in detail in the little <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of 
Hildegard. In this monastery, she established fifty benefices for noble ladies, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> for priests, and seven for poor 
women in honour of the <span class="t11 hoverable">Blessed</span> Virgin Mary. As <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as this, she founded another monastery half a mile away 
across the Rhine, where she established thirty benefices. 

14.4. On her reputation, he says that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> popes <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> of her fame and wrote to her, namely: Eugenius, Hadrian 
and Anastasius. The Archbishops of Mainz, Cologne, Trier and Magdeburg corresponded with her, also the 
Patriarch of Jerusalem, very many bishops, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, other abbots and provosts, and 
other prelates of churches; to all of these she sent replies. This information is <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from Hildegard’s <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of 
Letters. 

14.5. In addition, she began, in the forty-second year of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> (although she had no earthly teacher), to write 
not a few books by the revelation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit, which are more fully described in the introduction to her 
<span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Scivias.

14.7. On signs, he says that he believes in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the signs which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> performed through her in her

14.8. On the further circumstances of her life, he says that after he had made copies of her books according to 
the exemplars in his monastery, namely Scivias, the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits and the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Works, and 
after he had decided to make a pilgrimage to St Martin’s, he <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> the above-mentioned books with him to Paris. 
And so that he could study them more securely, he managed (with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> trouble and effort) to obtain permission 

from the then bishop of the locality to summon a meeting of all the masters then reading lectures in theology.^ 5 

He gave to each of them twelve books,? to be examined in the period from the octave of St Martin to the octave 
of Epiphany. After they had examined them, they returned them to the bishop. The latter then entrusted the 

books to William of Auxerre, a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of Paris at that time,^ who returned them to him confirming what the 
opinion of the masters was: that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> contained in them were not of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> but <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> origin. 

14.9. On her reputation, [Bruno] says this. When his mother was in a village <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Lorch, about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> miles away 
from the monastery Hildegard had built, and when she <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> from some other woman of the reputation for 
sanctity of the <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard, she <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> with her in a ferry, crossed the river and begged Hildegard to 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of blessing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. Which she also did. 


14-10. On the examination of the books, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> Arnold, a scholar of St Peter’s, who was studying theology at the 
time, says the same as Bruno. William, a canon of St John’s in Mainz, agrees under oath with Bruno, apart from 
the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the testing of the books and the story of Bruno’s visit to <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> Hildegard. The greater part of the 
monastery agrees under oath with all of Bruno’s <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> except for his visit to Hildegard. 

14.11. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">Master</span> John, a canon at Mainz, and now Provost in Bingen, agrees with the above <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the testing of 
the books, as he was studying theology in Paris at the time. He also says that a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> still living know

l. Letter to Bernard of Clairvaux 


1. [Letter l ]: The standard numbering of the letters follows the edition of the letters by Li even Van Acker, 
Hildegardis Bingensis Epistolarium CCCM 9i-9ia (Turnhout, 1991 and 1993) and the translation by Joseph L. 
Baird and Radd K. Ehrman, The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, 2 vols (Oxford, 1994 and 1998). This in turn 
follows the original manuscript arrangement of the collected correspondence in which the letters are ordered 
hierarchically according to the rank and importance of the correspondent. Bernard’s letter is clearly significant, 
for it is placed first, even before the various letters to the popes. 

2. the banner of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Cross... pagans: A reference to the preparations for the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Crusade, fought 
between 1147 and 1149. To ‘preach the cross’ meant to obtain military support for the Crusade by preaching in 
towns and cities throughout the country. An <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of such preaching (for the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Crusade 1189-92), and the 
fervent support it could inspire, is given in the first <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">chapter</span> of The Journey through Wales by Gerald of Wales, 
trans. Lewis Thorpe (Harmondsworth, 1978), pp. 74-7. 

3. the simple meaning... textual analysis: Hildegard claimed a reading <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Latin, as acquired perhaps 
gradually and subconsciously by many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of participation in the liturgy and by meditated reading of the 
scriptures and the Fathers of the Church. Other than learning to read the Latin psalms, she had not had access 
to any formal study of Latin grammar or rhetoric. For a discussion of the ways in which Hildegard could have 
acquired Latin, see the article by M. Atherton, ‘The Visions of Hildegard and the Silent Period. A <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">Case</span> Study of 
Language Acquisition’, System 21, no. 4 (1993), pp. 503-508. 

4. through your word: Hildegard hopes to receive an answer to her letter which she will ‘hear’ when Bernard’s 
letter is read aloud. 

5. wooden beam... world: The wooden beam of the wine-press (itself a common image in Hildegard) is linked by 
a chain of association with ideas of the tree of the Garden of Eden in Genesis and the root of the race of Adam. 
The associative method is typical of early medieval approaches to the exegesis and interpretation of scripture 
but is particularly common in Hildegard. It leads to her characteristic ‘mixed metaphors’, which occur 
particularly frequently in her songs. 

6. the eagle staring at the sun: The eagle is an image from the tradition of the bestiary, the class of <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> popular 
in the medieval period in which natural history is mixed with allegorical explanation. In Hildegard’s thought, 
the eagle represents <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who have the strength and maturity to understand the ways of God, who in turn is 
symbolized by the brightness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> and referred to traditionally as the ‘Sun of Justice’. In a short letter of 
c.H50(?) to an Abbot at Busenberg [Letter 71], Hildegard uses similar imagery: ‘The <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> speaks to 
you. Be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> servant in your mind. Watch with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will. Imitate the eagle that gazes at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> rather than

2. The Action of the Will (from Scivias) 


1. you are not a bundle... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the scriptures: Hildegard appears to mean: ‘As a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being you are 
more complex than you imagine, and you will learn this when sacred writings are explained to you.’ The phrase 
‘you are not a bundle of veins’ translates the Latin ‘quae non es sarcina medullarum’. The expression is an 
example of where Hildegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and images remain obscure and allusive. In the previous section (I, 4, 17) 
she has been speaking about old age and how the ‘bones and veins incline to weakness’, which perhaps gives a 
hint of her meaning. 

2. oven : The transforming effect of intense heat is a basic assumption behind this image of the will as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in 
an oven. 


3. Redemption (from Scivias) 


1. neither ablaze with the strength of strong lions... exhalations: This is probably an allusion to the strength of 
the learning and teaching of the trained scholars, from whom Hildegard felt distanced because she was, in her 
own words, merely a frail, uneducated woman. 

2. a secret seal on the vision: As the correspondence of the period shows, a seal was a standard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of ensuring 
secrecy for a letter. But the theme is also biblical. In Revelation 5:1, John the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> says: ‘And I saw in the right 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of him that sat on the throne a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.’ 

3 .And I saw a light-filled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> emerge: The Latin reads ‘Vidique de eodemfulgore praefatae aurorae 
serenissimum hominem egredientem’, suggesting that the figure is literally ‘the clearest man’, i.e. an image of 
Christ. A look at the illustration, reproduced in the Latin edition and in many books on Hildegard, is useful for 
understanding the iconography Hildegard herself gives on the exegesis of the image at II, 1, 13 (see below). 

4. as a woman... uneducated: The Latin has ‘in nomine femineo indocta’, ‘untaught in your feminine name’. The 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of this paragraph spoken by the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> provides a justification for Hildegard to continue in 
her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> as a female visionary and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> mouthpiece. Only with such a status can she feel justified in 
proceeding further in the predominantly male <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of literature and philosophy. Cf. her letter to Bernard of 
Clairvaux from about the same period (1). 

5 .fickleness: The Latin has ‘petulantia’; cf. The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits (27) for a detailed treatment of this failing. 

6 . The ‘shining fire’ which you see: Hildegard conventionally presents the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the subsequent exegesis and 
explication of the vision as a transcription of the message spoken by the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the living fire. At intervals, 
we are reminded of the origin of this <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> addressing Hildegard with the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> singular ‘you’ or 
speaking of ‘my’ inspiration; nevertheless, at least for the modern reader, it is tempting to forget this is the 
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> and to regard it as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Hildegard herself. 

7. ‘Who knoweth not... all mankind’: Job 12:9-10. 

8. all the causes and relationships which make up its fruitfulness and fertility: A paraphrase of the Latin ‘quod 
uicissitudinem plenitudinis suae in illis causis ignoret in quibus fructuosa consistit’, literally, ‘that he should be 
ignorant of the alternation of the fullness in the causes in which fruitfulness consists’. 

9. sighs, groanings and desires for God: Psalm 38:9: ‘Lord, all my <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> is before thee; and my groaning is not 
hid from thee.’ 

10. Therefore, also, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being contains the likeness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> her: Hildegard’s 
anthropology is broadly humanistic in its scope. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> the similar statement in The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits VI, lines

11. through the pure green vigour: Latin ‘per viriditatem suauitatis’. 

12. the localized word: Latin ‘per locale verbum’: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> speech, which is fleeting and impermanent compared 
to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Word</span> of creation. 

13. commands of a ruler... his commands: Hildegard compares the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> spoken by a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> in authority with 
the strength of God’s Word. 

14. the functioning word... the perfectly filled Word: The impermanent, pragmatic, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> ‘word’ is the capacity 
for speech, the crowning <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of homo loquens which sets <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t1 t4 t8 t16 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> apart from the animal world.

the Father. 

15. And suddenly a dark sphere... never absent: In this <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> the dark material out of which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is made

<span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> is spherical, because it is somehow encompassed by God’s power, and still dark because it is incomplete, 
since it has not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> collided with the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of creation. 

16. ‘And it heated the clump of earth, turning it to <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> and blood’: For Hildegard, heat is the important force 
that transforms one substance into another. 


17- <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the material out of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t21 hoverable">flesh</span> is made... a mother suckling a child: In the Genesis <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> 
of creation, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> creates Adam out of the dust of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and breathes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> into him. Hildegard retells this story 
in her own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and concepts. According to her, the Latin term materia represents the basic ‘matter’ of the 
universe, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to create <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings, but also linked by etymology with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> mater, ‘mother’. This 
suggests to Hildegard the analogy of the mother suckling her child and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> nourishing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. 
18. a rational <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being made up of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul: The idea of the wholeness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being clashes 
with the dualistic notions of the Cathars, against whom Hildegard was to preach in Cologne. 

19 .Abraham, Isaac and Jacob... in their family relationship: Hildegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> speaks of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> prophets being 
linked ‘carnis coniunctione’ (‘by conjunction of the flesh’), in other words, they are linked on the literal level by 
their relationship as members of the same family. As often in medieval exegesis of the Bible, the figures of the 
Old Testament are seen as prefiguring the teachings of the New. On the figurative or typological level of 
interpretation, therefore, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> are seen also as signs symbolizing and prefiguring the Trinity of the

21. the one who came to himself... back to his father: At the end of the parable of the Prodigal Son, the runaway 
son, now suffering from hunger, decides to return: ‘But when he came to himself, he said... I will arise and go to 
my father, and will say <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> sight: I am no more worthy to

1. Rheims: Gilbert’s ideas are discussed by Adelgundis Fiihrkotter in Hildegard von Bingen. Briefwechsel 
(Salzburg, 1965), pp. 42-3. For Odo’s letter to Hildegard, see 32. For another letter of dense theological content 
sent by Hildegard in response to a query see letter 31R, translated by Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman, The 
Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, vol. 1 (Oxford, 1994). 

2. ‘I am who I am’: Cf. Exodus 3:14. 


5. The Trinity (from Scivias) 


1. hard-heartedness: Latin ‘obduratio’. 

2. supremely just uniformity: Latin ‘iustissima aequitas’. 

3. towards the end of all time: Latin ‘sub fine temporum’. 

4. my loved one: A traditional description associated with the apostle John. 

5. ‘The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of God... propitiation for our sins’: I John 4:9-10. 

6. his most precious pearl - the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being: On Hildegard’s <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of pearl imagery, see the discussion in the 
Introduction, III.i. 

7. In a stone there is moist greenness, palpable strength and red-burning fire: The Latin terms are ‘umida 
viriditas’, ‘palpabilis comprehensio’ and ‘rutilans ignis’. The practical uses and applications of various stones are 
treated more fully in Hildegard’s treatise The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Gemstones (22). 

8. who comes into contact... and falls ill: In medieval science, stones were believed to contain varying 
proportions of energy and moisture (fire and water), while in the medical lore of the period it was believed that 
an imbalance of the four elements in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> could lead to ill-health (see 22). 

9. sound, force and breath: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Latin terms which Hildegard employs for the parts of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> are: sonus, 
virtus, and flatus. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> their different uses elsewhere. Sonus is the sacred ‘sound’ which Hildegard refers to in 
the letter to Bernard of Clairvaux (1), while virtus normally has the double <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of both ‘virtue’ and ‘power’. 

10. the first and the last: See Revelation 1:17. 

11. ‘Remember your Creator... I do not like them’: Ecclesiastes 12: 1. 

12. the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of life: Hildegard’s term is ‘vivificatio’. 

13. the behaviour of childhood: Hildegard’s conception of personal development from childishness to maturity 
may derive from St Paul; it features also in an autobiographical <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> of Hildegard where she 
describes her own behaviour as a young woman struggling to cope with her visionary gift: ‘then I behaved more 
in the character of a child than of someone of my years’ (33).

during the church service. 


8. Letter to Hartwig of Bremen 


1. Hartwig... Richardis... Hildegard: Hildegard came into open conflict with Hartwig over the appointment of 
his sister Richardis as Abbess of Bassum, in the diocese of Bremen. There is no mention of this conflict here, 
and little in the letter allows for a precise dating. 

2. ‘You are gods... most high’: Psalm 82:6. Elsewhere, Hildegard saw the reference to ‘gods’ as indicating a 
bishop’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and ‘sons of the most high’ as signifying his role in the pastoral care of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of his

3. ‘Who are these that fly as clouds... windows?’: Isaiah 60:8. A common image in Hildegard, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> at the 
beginning of The Play of the Virtues. See also 9, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 7. 


9. Song for Saint Ursula 


1. 0 Ecclesia oculi tui. Sequence : Pudentiana Barth and Immaculata Ritscher (eds), Hildegard von Bingen. 

Lieder (Salzburg, 1969), no. 54 and Barbara Newman (ed.), Hildegard of Bingen. Symphonia, 2nd edn (Ithaca, 
1998), no. 64. 

2. like sapphire: Cf. Ezekiel 1:26, a vision of four-winged creatures: ‘Above the expanse over their heads was 
what looked like a throne of sapphire...’ 

3. like Mount Bethel: See Genesis 28:11-22, the story of Jacob’s dream at Bethel, where he saw a stairway 
reaching from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> on which angels were ascending and descending; in the same vision he <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a

4. a mountain of myrrh and incense: Song of Songs (or Song of Solomon) 4:6: ‘I will go to the mountain of 
myrrh and to the hill of incense.’ See also Song of Songs 4:1-5, where the lover praises the various aspects of his 
bride in a series of similes which probably influenced the first few lines of Hildegard’s poem. In the medieval 
commentary tradition, the lover of the Song of Songs was interpreted allegorically as Christ, while the bride was 
seen as the Church. 

5. the sound of many waters: The same image recurs in Hildegard’s writings; it derives from Ezekiel 1:24 and 
Revelation 1:15. 

6. ‘I have eagerly desired: Cf. Luke 22:15, where <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> says to his disciples: ‘I have eagerly desired to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> this 
Passover with you before I suffer.’ 

7. like a cloud: An echo of Isaiah 60:8: ‘Who are these that fly like clouds’. 

8. make fun of her, singing their songs: The Latin has ‘luder’, ‘to play’, ‘in magna symphonia’, ‘in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> 
harmony’. As The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I, 5-6 shows (27), ‘playfulness’ is a fickle, malicious mockery, a vice to 
be remedied and defeated by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> ‘shame’. Sabina Flanagan, in Hildegard of Bingen 1098-1179: A Visionary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> 
(London, 1989), p. 137, interprets the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> differently, suggesting that the term ludere refers to games played 
on board ship as Ursula and her companions travelled on their pilgrimage. 

9. necklace of pearls: I.e. Ursula and her companions. 

10. material...: Latin ‘materia’. A common idea in Hildegard’s writings. 


io. The Trials of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> (from Scivias) 


1. Where am I in my exile?: The Latin has ‘peregrina’, which means both ‘pilgrim’ and ‘exile’. In the next line the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is described as having ‘the comfort of pilgrims’. Cf. the letter to Bernard of Clairvaux, where Adam is 
described as ‘exsul inperegrinum mundum’, ‘a wanderer in this exile world’. There are many echoes of the 
Bible: Luke 1:79, <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> 12:24, II Corinthians 5:4, II Peter 1:13-14. For analogous passages in other texts, 
particularly Gregory the Great’s Moralia in lob, see the edition by Adelgundis Fiihrkotter and Angela Carlevaris, 
Scivias, CCCM 43-433 (Turnhout, 1978), pp. 62-6. 

2. tabernacle: The tent or tabernacle is an image of the body. 

3. gemstones: The significance of gemstones derives from their <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> in the description of the heavenly <span class="t28 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> 
in Revelation 21:16-21, and from the belief in their healing properties, which Hildegard described in her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> 
Physica (22). 

4. the living breath: Refers to the soul. 

5. the north: The location of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in Hildegard’s allegories and cosmology. The idea may derive from biblical 
passages such as Ezekiel 9:2. 

6. But what misfortune! ... Abomination!: Hildegard uses the Latin ‘heu’ and then the German ‘ach’ (an example 
of Hildegard using German in the middle of her Latin text). Both exclamations have the force ofthe now little- 
<span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> English <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘alas’. 

7. made me <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> with the pigs: A reference to the New Testament parable of the Prodigal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> from Luke 15:11- 
32. For Hildegard’s interpretation of this parable, see Scivias II, 5, 14 (16). 

8. they laid me in a wine-press: The image may derive from Revelation 19:15. See also the letter to Bernard (1), 
where Hildegard says: ‘I am unstable with the movement of the wooden beam of the wine-press in my nature’. 

9. harmonies of music: The ‘harmonies of music’ are part of the ‘sacred sound by which all <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> resounds’, a 
basic idea in Hildegard’s philosophy of music. 

10. and so I could not be harmed by them: The illustration for this scene from the Rupertsberg manuscript of 
Scivias shows the kneeling figure of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in a square edifice topped with a tower. In the lower <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> a devil 
attempts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> success to enter the door, while at top right <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> devils try to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> arrows at the soul. In the top 
<span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> of the picture the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> appears in a cloud and points towards the soul, bestowing the blessing of

11. pride: Hildegard appears to be personifying the vice here, although this is ambiguous in the original Latin. 

12. the cave of pride ofthe ancient serpent: The Latin reads: ‘superbiam antiquae speluncae’, literally ‘the pride 
of the ancient cave’. 

13. ‘Cast away... a new spirit’: Ezekiel 18:31.

2. O beatissime Ruperte. Antiphon for St Rupert: Barth and Ritscher, Hildegard von Bingen. Lieder, no. 36 and

valley floor and the vision itself in which Hildegard felt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to move there and found her community. 

7. in Loves embrace: Another textual reading gives the translation ‘in the embrace of chastity’. 

8. soared like clouds in the sky: A recurring image in Hildegard’s writings. Based on Isaiah 60:8.

1. For Heinrich’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to release Richardis, see 32, Letter 18 to Hildegard. 

2. For other letters connected with the affair, see Lieven Van Acker, Hildegardis Bingensis Epistolarium CCCM 
9i-9ia (Turnhout, 1991 and 1993) and the translation by Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman, The Letters of 
Hildegard of Bingen, 2 vols (Oxford, 1994 and 1998), Letters 4, 64, 13, 13R. Richardis apparently decided to 
return but unfortunately died before she could make the journey. Peter Dronke has <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> a sensitive study of 
these events in his Women Writers of the Middle Ages. Letter 19 in the standard collection is also interesting in 
its condemnation of Heinrich of Mainz around the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his deposition from the archbishopric in 1153. 

3. zeal: In Hildegard’s writings, ‘zeal’ often represents the righteous anger of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> justice. 

4. ‘It is good... princes’: Psalm 118:9. 


13 * The First Version of The Play of the Virtues (from Scivias) 

1. Play of the Virtues: An excellent edition and translation of the final version of 1158 is Peter Dronke (ed. and 
trans.), Ordo virtutum, in his Nine Medieval Latin Plays (Cambridge, 1994). 

2. But a report... expensive clothes’: Letter 52 in the standard numbering. See the Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> edited by Lieven Van 
Acker, Hildegardis Bingensis Epistolarium CCCM 91 (Turnhout, 1991 and 1993) and the translation by Joseph 
L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman, The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, vol. 1 (Oxford, 1994). The ‘first shepherd of 
the Church’ refers to St Paul, and the biblical quotation is from I Timothy 2:9. 

3. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> of kings: The phrase occurs in Revelation 19:16. 

4. the profound depths of the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of God: Hildegard draws on a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> of praise from Romans 11:33, which 
begins: ‘Oh, the depth of the riches of the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God...’

182) the sentence echoes Christ’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> about the woman who washed his feet in Luke 7:47: ‘Wherefore I say

6. kiss of your heart: See Song of Songs 1:2: ‘Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth...’ 

7. hide your face... Creator: Genesis 3:8: ‘Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> 
amongst the trees of the garden.’ 

8. Alas, alas: This speech later became the beginning of scene 3 of The Play of the Virtues, see Dronke’s edition, 
lines 159-60. 

9. the sheep of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has fled this life: An allusion to the parable of the Lost Sheep in Luke 15: 4-7. 

10. the lost drachma: An allusion to the parable of the Lost Coin in Luke 15:8-10: ‘Or again, what woman with 
ten drachmas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not, if she lost one, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> a lamp and sweep out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and search thoroughly till she

angels of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> over one repentant sinner.’ 

11. crown... perseverance: Hildegard perhaps has in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> Revelation 2:10, which speaks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who suffer 
imprisonment by the devil and persecution for ten days, but stay faithful and are rewarded with the ‘crown of

Latin Plays, lines 68-75. 

13. awakened you under the apple tree: Song of Songs 8:5. 

14. What is this power... in the heights: See Play of the Virtues, ed. Peter Dronke, in Nine Medieval Latin Plays, 
lines 59-60. 

15. none beside <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> alone: An echo of Psalm 18:31, or Psalm 17:32 (Vulgate). 

16 . 1 will give them everything: See the temptation of <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> in Matthew 4:9, where the devil makes a similar 
speech. 

17. THE LAMENT OF THE PENITENT SOUL... VIRTUES : The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> now runs in parallel with the later Play of the 
Virtues, scenes 3 and 4, lines 159-97, 209-28, 242-51, with occasional minor changes.

the Lost Sheep in Luke 15:4-7. 

21. to sound forth in harmony: The Latin ‘in symphonia sonare’ recalls the title Symphonia of Hildegard’s 
collection of songs. 


14 . <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Political Letters 


1. robbers lie in wait by night: Cf. the extract ‘The unarmed youth on the road’ in 16 ( Scivias II, 3,16-17). 

2. breastplate: Cf. the ‘breastplate of righteousness’ in Isaiah 59:17 and Ephesians 6:14; the ‘breastplate of <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> 
and love’ in I Thessalonians 5:8; the ‘breastplates of fire’ in Revelation 9:17. 

3. the my Stic flower... virginity: Eugenius was originally a Cistercian monk from Clairvaux, a monastic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> 
with a strong interest in the contemplative life. 

4. the branch of the Church: I.e. the Papacy. 

5. bear: On a theological level, the bear could be a symbol of the devil, but on a political level, this is likely to be 
a reference to the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman suggest in the notes to 
their translation The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen. 

6. golden shoes: The idea is perhaps biblical; cf. Ephesians 6:15, where shoes are associated with the ‘gospel of 
peace’. 

7. choose... the better part: Luke 10:42. 

8. Henry, Bishop of Liege: For Henry’s question to Hildegard, see 32, Letter 37. 

9. the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> mountain: An image with many connotations. The basic idea is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of salvation, which

The same image occurs in the vision of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> on the 
mountain in Scivias (25) and in the vision of the cosmic egg in Scivias I, 3 (20). 

10. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and faithful servant: Matthew 25:21, 23. 

11. the mud from the beautiful pearls: Compare Hildegard’s parable of the pearl in Scivias I, 2, 32 (see 
Introduction, III.i). 

12. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the strong key: Cf.

14. you will see in his light: Cf. Psalm 36:9. 


15. Songs for the Dedication of a Church 


1. Arnold of Brescia: The suggestion is made by Barbara Newman in her Sister of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> and again in her 
Symphonia, 2nd edn (Ithaca, 1998), p. 315. 

2. O virgo ecclesia. Antiphon: Pudentiana Barth and Immaculata Ritscher (eds), Hildegard von Bingen. Lieder 
(Salzburg, 1969), no. 56 and Barbara Newman (ed.), Hildegard of Bingen. Symphonia, no. 66. The song uses 
traditional imagery of the Church as mother and bride of the King. 

3. banner of the king: I.e. the cross. 

4. Nunc gaudeant. Antiphon: Barth and Ritscher, Hildegard von Bingen. Lieder, no. 57 and Newman, 
Symphonia, no. 67. This song is the last piece in the Dendermonde manuscript. 


i6. Teachings on the Church (from Scivias) 


1. ‘unable and unwilling to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> it’: Arnold of Cologne to Hildegard (Letter 14).

Cologne. 

2. ‘The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> sent a word... it has lighted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> Israel’: Isaiah 9:8. 

3. ‘Who are these... to their windows?’: Isaiah 60:8. Here Hildegard comments on the relationship of the 
Synagogue to the Church. The final version of The Play of the Virtues, which was issued in 1158, should be 
compared with this passage. The opening section of the prologue gives another <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of the same verse, for now 
Hildegard imagines it spoken by the prophets and patriarchs of old rather than the Synagogue: 

PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS: 

Who are these? Who are these that fly as a cloud? 

VIRTUES: 

Oh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Antiquity, why are you amazed at us?

and so we shine with him, 

forming the limbs of his beautiful body. 

PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS: 

We are the roots and you are the branches, 
the fruits of the living eye 
in which we were the shadow. 

See also Letter II to Hartwig of Bremen, Richardis’s brother (8), which uses the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> from Isaiah. 

4. The bright radiance... hindrance: The concept of radiance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a gemstone is reminiscent of Hildegard’s 
treatment of gemstones in Physica, although the carbuncle is not included among the stones she discusses 
there. See 22. 

5. baptism: The need to provide teaching on sacraments such as baptism should be seen against the background 
of the Cathar movement, which rejected them. 

6. ways: Cf. the title of the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> Scivias, usually interpreted as scito vias, i.e. ‘know the ways.’ 

7. travel on the road: The story recalls biblical parables, but also reflects the dangers of travel in the twelfth 
century. 

8. ‘And on the morrow... I will repay thee’: Luke 10:35, from the parable of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> Samaritan, who helps a 
traveller wounded by robbers and takes him to an inn to be looked after. 

9. “Well done you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and faithful servant”: Matthew 25:21. 

10. they are built not on rock but on sand: A clear link to the parable from the Sermon on the Mount in 
Matthew 7:24-7, where <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> tells the story of a <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who built his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> on a foundation of rock while a

11. [On oblates]: Oblates were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> dedicated to the monastic life, often at a very early age. Despite the <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> 
regard she had for the monastic vocation, Hildegard approved of oblation only if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> were given an 
opportunity to decide for themselves when old enough to make decisions. For more discussion of Hildegard’s

17. Letter to Elisabeth of Schonau 


1. One important manuscript... Villers in Brabant: The manuscript is now preserved as Codex 9 of the library of 
the Benedictine monastery at Dendermonde in Belgium. 

2. vessel... perfected in it: Cf. II Corinthians 4:7: ‘But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency

3 . Ach! Weh!: Hildegard’s cry of dismay, equivalent to ‘alas’ and ‘woe’, is spoken in German rather than Latin. 

4. become a complete mockery: Latin ‘derideretur’.

Monasteries (Collegeville, MN, 1948), p. 18. 

2. Abbess of Bamberg: For the request from the Abbess to Hildegard, see 32, Letter 61. 


20. The Cosmic Egg (from Scivias) 


1. shaped like an egg: The twelfth century did not believe in a flat earth. The image of the cosmos as an egg is 
not original to Hildegard, but she was clearly fascinated by it. 

2. The horror... stones <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and small: As Frances Beer suggests, ‘the vision is ultimately reassuring because it 
reveals how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> can exist and, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as it is part of the creation, be counterbalanced and controlled 
by the forces of good’. See her Women and Mystical Experience in the Middle Ages (Woodbridge, 1992), p. 46. 

3. between the north and the east... a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain... towards the east: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mountain separates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in 
the east from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in the north. 

4. Through his creation... <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> things: This is Hildegard’s explanation for her allegorical approach, namely 
that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> can be understood not only as phenomena of nature, but also as symbols illustrating 
the history of the faith. 

5. The elements... render them their service: The elements in medieval science are earth, air, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (i.e. energy) 
and water; all are involved in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> physiology, and for Hildegard the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being is seen as being at one with 
the world, as part of a positive <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and ecology. 

6. ‘Thou <span class="t0 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">hast</span> crowned him... the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> ofthy hands’: From Psalm 8:5-6. 


21. The Cosmos (from Causes and Cures ) 


1. he was always <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> : See John 1:3-4. 

2. still unformed : Cf. Genesis 1:2: ‘And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> form, and void; and darkness was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the face of 
the deep.’ 

3. ‘Let there be light’: Genesis 1:3. 

4. the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the air which we can see: As in the vision of the cosmic egg in Scivias, the air forms a sublunary 
atmosphere, i.e. below the level of the moon’s orbit, while the ether is a higher, superlunary layer above the 
level of the moon. 

5. The fall of Lucifer: Many of the ideas in this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> go back to the biblical verses on the same topic in Isaiah 
14:12-15. A similar <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of ideas about Lucifer occurs in The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits VI, 14, treated there for their 
moral significance rather than as part of a cosmology, as here. 

6. his envy of God: As Margret Berger points out in her Hildegard of Bingen. On Natural Philosophy and 
Medicine (Cambridge, 1999), p. 24, this phrase could also be interpreted as ‘God’s punitive zeal’. Although such 
a phrase does not fit the context so well, it occurs in other writings of Hildegard, for instance in The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of 
Life’s Merits. 

7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> being all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> lie concealed: There are parallels to this idea in Erigena’s Periphyseon 
(755B) and Honorius of Autun’s Clavis physicae (n. 241); see Margret Berger, Hildegard of Bingen, p. 24. 

8. ancient counsel... man: Hildegard’s notion of the ‘ancient counsel’ indicates her belief in the ‘absolute 
predestination of Christ’, the doctrine that <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have become <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> or not the Fall had <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> 
place. 

9 .fire of judgement... stench and cold: In one of the plagues described in Exodus 9:23-4, hail falls during a 
thunderstorm, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> runs along the ground. In other words, there is the stench of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> mingled with the 
cold of the hail. 

10. the wings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of God: Cf. Psalm 104:3. 

11. <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> their song back into harmony: The Latin reads ‘cantum in symphoniaferent’, which connects this idea 
with Hildegard’s ‘Symphonia’, and the notion of heavenly harmony in her theology of music. 

12. bad humours... illness: According to the humoral physiology of ancient and medieval medicine, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was made up of four humours in balance. According to the theory in its simplest terms, illness is caused 
either by an imbalance of humours or by bad humours. See Margret Berger, Hildegard of Bingen, p. 15. 

13. the sun’s heat is greater... above it: A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> instance of the twelfth-century belief in a spherical earth, with the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> orbiting round it. In winter, according to this view, the other <span class="t6 hoverable">side</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is warmer in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to keep the

14. immoderation: Alack of balance. In the Hildegardian cosmos, everything must moderate itself to the mean. 

15. a loadstone attracting iron to it: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> has ‘achates’, i.e. ‘agate’, the wrong kind of stone. There may have 
been a scribal error, with ‘achates’ being <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> instead of ‘magnes’; see Margret Berger, Hildegard of Bingen, p. 
29. 

16. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> precedes... the day... the moon precedes... the night... : The idea is adapted from Genesis 1:16-18:

the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the magic arts in Scivias I, 3 (see Introduction at II. 1). 


23. Songs from Symphonia 


1. 0 magne pater. Antiphon: See Barbara Newman (ed.), Hildegard of Bingen. Symphonia, 2nd edn (Ithaca, 
1998), no. 6. In her useful notes to this song, Newman suggests that it is influenced by Genesis 2:18. 

2. O eterne deus. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 7. The song is based on the idea in Ephesians 1:22-3 that 
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> is appointed to be <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> over the Church, which is his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and limbs. This is then combined with an 
image of the first dawn derived from Psalm 110:3. 

3 . Ave Maria. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 8. 

4. O clarissima mater. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 9. The ‘star of the sea’ is a traditional image for 
Mary. 

5. O splendidissima gemma. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 10. Adam of St Victor uses the same image of 
the gem in a sequence for Christmas. 

6. Hodie aperuit. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 11. A song in which several very different images (gate, 
woman, dawn, flower) are presented in rapid succession. The idea of the ‘closed gate’ derives from a vision in 
Ezekiel 44:2-3 where the prophet sees a gate shut after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> has passed through it and hears that ‘the prince 
himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to <span class="t28 hoverable">eat</span> in the presence of the Lord’. The serpent and the 
woman are from the story of Eve in the Garden of Eden. The Dendermonde manuscript begins the song with the 
very specific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ‘hodie’, ‘today’, rather than ‘ nunc ’, ‘now’, of other versions. 

7. Quia ergo femina. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 12. Newman (p. 273) argues that the ‘ ergo ’ shows that 
this is a sequel to the preceding antiphon. The ‘form of a woman’ is both the Platonic idea and also a suggestion 
of weakness, as in the openings of Hildegard’s letters and visionary works. 

8. Cum processit factura. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 13. There is a textual crux in the reading ‘joys of 
life’ Qgaudia vite) rather than ‘joys in you’ (‘g audio in te). 

9. O virga ac diadema. Sequence: Newman, Symphonia, no. 20. From an anecdote in the Canonization Protocol, 
there is evidence to suggest that this sequence was a particular favourite of Hildegard. See 35, paragraph 9.2 of 
the Protocol. 

10. Spiritus sanctus vivificans vita. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 24. 

11. Caritas abundat. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 25. An alternative medieval spelling of the title is 
Karitas habundat. 

12. O gloriosissimi. Antiphon: Newman, Symphonia, no. 29. 

13. O speculum columbe. Antiphon for John the Evangelist: Newman, Symphonia, no. 35. ‘The beloved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of 
the Lamb’ refers to the description ‘one of them, the disciple whom <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> loved’ in John 13:23. 

14. O dulcis electe. Responsory for John the Evangelist: Newman, Symphonia, no. 36. The phrase translated as 
‘on the greenness of the pastors of the Church’ (Latin ‘in viriditate pigmentariorum’) picks up the Hildegardian 
image of priests as ‘perfumers.’ 

15. O vis aeternitatis. Responsory: Newman, Symphonia, no. 1. The Dendermonde manuscript lacks a few pages 
at the beginning and it is possible that this song was the initial piece. See the journal article by Peter Dronke, 
‘The Composition of Hildegard of Bingen’s Symphonia’, Sacris Erudiri 19 (1969-70), pp. 381-93. 

16. O virtus sapientie: Newman, Symphonia, no. 2. For a discussion of the themes of this song see Introduction 
II.4. The ideas of the sapiential literature of the Apocrypha lie behind this text, particularly <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> of Solomon 
8:1, which reads: ‘Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> all things’ and 
Ecclesiasticus 24:5-6, where <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> speaks: ‘I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the 
bottom of the deep. In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth, and in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and nation, I got a 
possession.’ 


24. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Christmas Homilies 


1. [ Pitra (ed., homilies Hi and Ilii ]: The Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> is from J. B. Pitra (ed.), Analecta sanctae Hildegardis 
opera , in Analecta Sacra, vol. 8 (Montecassino, 1882), pp. 247-9. 

2. For the first mass: This homily is intended to explain the Gospel reading for the first mass on Christmas Day. 

3. ancient counsel: The term <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in Hildegard’s theology for the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> plan from before the creation. In giving 
allegorical meanings to the passage, Hildegard follows in the tradition of the commentaries of Bede and Gregory 
the Great, who see Caesar Augustus as representing God; but she adds a cosmological reading which is strongly 
influenced by Neoplatonism. See the detailed analysis in Peter Dronke, ‘Platonic-Christian Allegories in the 
Homilies of Hildegard of Bingen’, in Haijo Jan Westra (ed.), From Athens to Chartres. Neoplatonism and 
Medieval Thought. Studies in Honour of Edouard Teaunea (Leiden, 1992), pp. 281-96. 


25. The Iron Mountain (from Scivias) 


l. ‘He becometh poor... maketh rich’: Proverbs 10:4. 


26. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> Looking East and South (from The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits ) 

1. And I saw...: Hildegard begins her vision appropriately with an opening formula that recalls the writings of 
the biblical prophets; cf. Ezekiel 1:4 or Revelation 5:1, 6, 11. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> also the alliteration of the /v/ consonants in 
the original Latin ‘Et vidi virum’. 

2. stood... turned... looked: Various important aspects of the Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> do not come over in a modern English 
translation: in this paragraph, there is the end rhyme ‘-bat’, ‘-at’ on the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> verbs, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as a rhythmical 
balance and cadence: ‘supra abyssum stabat. Et se ad orientem verterat, ita quod et orientem et austrum 
inspiciebat’ . Such acoustic and rhetorical features were calculated to please the medieval reader, who more often 
than not listened to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> being read aloud, or murmured it quietly during the act of reading. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> 
Hildegard’s Latin may not be conventional by the classical standards of the ‘twelfth-century Renaissance’ (and 
her secretary Volmar may in <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> have edited and corrected her Latin case-endings and conjugations), 
nevertheless she is clearly in <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> control of both her content and her medium of its expression. 

3. writing tablet: The Latin tabula is here translated as ‘writing tablet’. Parchment was expensive and paper 
unavailable in this period. The essential note-taking tool since Roman times had been a wooden frame filled 
with wax that was <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in conjunction with a metal writing stylus; the writing on the soft wax could be erased 
and the <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">tablet</span> reused. In the opening illustration of the Rupertsberg codex of Scivias (and in many of the 
illustrations of the Lucca manuscript of The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Works), the figure of Hildegard is depicted in the act 
of receiving the vision and writing it down on her tablet; only her secretary (Volmar) is seen actually using pen, 
ink and parchment. 

4. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> here also the characteristic Hildegardian theological term ‘scientia Dei ’, ‘knowledge 
of God’. 

5. one sound: By repetition of the adjective ‘one’, Hildegard rings the changes on the concept of unity: ‘one life... 
one will... one conjunction... one devotion... one sound’ (Latin ‘uno sono’). The latter phrase has been translated 
‘with one sound’, but Hildegard must mean that the ‘host of <span class="t11 hoverable">blessed</span> spirits’ blend their voices to sing in unison, 
a type of musical experience with which she was very familiar from her own songs and settings for the liturgy. 
The notion of the ‘sound’ of all varieties of music occurs in the letter to Bernard of Clairvaux (i). 

6. aforementioned: The frequent adjective ‘aforementioned’ or ‘aforesaid’ (' praedictus 0 is strange to modern 
ears, but serves to orient the medieval audience and prompt their memories as they listen to the reading of the 
text. 

7. trumpet blast... habitations: Hildegard’s vocabulary is heavily influenced by that of Revelation, Ezekiel and 
other apocalyptic and visionary writings. Cf. Revelation 8:12-13. 

8. lion... goat: The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> for ‘lion’ and ‘goat’ are leo and capricornus, both signs of the zodiac; they are referred 
to here not necessarily for any astrological <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> but rather for their astronomical and symbolic significance. 
The twelve signs of the zodiac are, it will be recalled, positions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the belt of stars in the night sky against 
which observers can plot the changing position of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> at the various times of the year. 

9. the ‘misleader’: The Latin for ‘leader’, dux, is derived from the same root <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> duco, ‘I lead’, as seductor, 
hence the translation ‘misleader’. Hildegard is using etymology to emphasize her point. 

10. a cloud coming from the North: The North is the region of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> associated with the devil; the cloud that 
originates there is described as ‘aridus’, an apt choice of adjective to represent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and a term which in 
Hilldegard’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> contrasts effectively with her important and frequently encountered notion of ‘viriditas’, or 
‘greenness’, as <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> for instance in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> in Mercy’s speech against the fourth figure, Hardness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heart</span> (see 
The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits I, 8). 

11. ancient serpent: The ‘serpent’ is of course the devil, as in the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the Fall in the biblical Genesis. 
‘Ancient Enemy’ (‘ antiquus hostis’) is a traditional term for the devil in medieval literature, with origins in 
patristic commentaries and sermons. 

12. the images... of vices: Here, as also in her exegesis, Hildegard stresses the symbolic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of her vision; she 
sees symbolic images of vices rather than actual creatures, and among the forms she sees, she chooses to focus 


on seven 



27. The Seven Vices and Virtues (from The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits ) 

1. The Wonders of the East: See Richard Stoneman, Legends of Alexander the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> (London, 1994), pp. 20-24. 

2. So why dry up... for shame!: The Latin style is worthy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> in this passage. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> not a poem as such, it 
is remarkable for its strong rhythms and the AB AB AAA rhyme-scheme of its verbs, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as other internal

Et quare arescerem, cum omnem viriditatem habeam? Cur quasi in senili etate viverem, cum in iuventute 
floream? Quare pulchrum visum oculorum in cecitate ducerem? Quod si hocfacerem, erubescerem.’ 

[‘So why dry up when I possess all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of greenness? Why live in senile old age, when I can flourish in

The language seems to echo and reinforce to the semi-aggressive statements of amor seculi. With an

speaking about positive forces such as ‘greenness’ but misusing them - in Hildegard’s <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> - for false purposes. 
This feature of a vice using the language of virtue to deceive her audience is also found in Prudentius’s 
Psychomachia. 

3. 1 <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> respond to the first figure: The <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of the first virtue, ‘Heavenly Love’. 

4. The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> figure... prey: The dog Hildegard depicts here appears to be a kind of coursing-hound or hunting- 
dog. As emerges in the later exegesis which follows the narrative of the vices, the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> figure represents 
petulantia, which could be translated as ‘Fickleness’, since the vice is described as chasing after whims and 
deceiving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with fine talk about laughter. The Latin <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> also has connotations of ‘impudence’, a 
personality feature which also emerges - at least in part - in the characterization of the figure here, for instance 
in the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the vice entices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> then deals them serious wounds. 

5. 1 <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a voice: As we learn later in the book, the virtue ‘True Discipline’ is speaking here. 

6. The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> figure... clothing: The <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> vice represents ioculatrix, ‘Superficiality’, ‘Jocularity’ or ‘Amusemen’, a 
kind of superficial lack of gravity which the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the cloud condemns as ‘idolatry’. As with the other vices 
that employ the vocabulary of virtue to beautify their own speeches and actions, Superficiality attempts to make 
himself attractive to his listeners by evoking the joy of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and using this to justify his own behaviour. 

7. the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: Spoken by the virtue ‘Shame’. 

8. The fourth figure... motionless: The fourth image, the cloud of smoke, represents obduratio, Hardness of 
Heart’. 

9. So why should I labour... to pieces?: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> the rhyming prose in the original Latin (lines 194-5): ‘Quare ergo 
causa ullius laborarem, et me dilacerarem?’ (‘Why should I labour for any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> cause? Why tear myself to 
pieces?’). 

10. the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the aforementioned storm-cloud: The fourth virtue is ‘True Mercy’. 

11. the stone presents its moisture: The idea of ‘perspiration’ in stones is explicable as part of the medieval 
notion of the four elements, namely: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> (i.e. solid matter), air (gases), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> (energy) and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> (moisture), 
each of which is found in varying quantities in every <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> thing. See The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Gemstones in 22. 

12. The fifth figure... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> head: The fifth vice is ignavia, ‘Lack of Spirit’. This figure with a large ear covering 
all its <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> is reminiscent of creatures with grotesquely exaggerated limbs in the Marvels of the East tradition. 

13. the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: The fifth virtue is ‘Divine Victory’. 

14. The sixth figure... burning brands: The sixth vice, ira, ‘Anger’, has flames issuing from its mouth like the 
monsters of legend, while the firebrands recall depictions of Anger in the traditional illustrations of vices in 
manuscripts of Prudentius’s Psychomachia. 

15. the response ofthe <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: The sixth virtue is ‘Divine Patience’; patience is the 
traditional remedy for anger in the psychomachia tradition. 

16. The seventh figure... quite naked: The seventh vice is inepta letitia, ‘Foolish Joy’. Similarities will be noted 


between the individual members of this group of seven sins; here in particular Foolish Joy recalls the first, 
<span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> and <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> figures of vice, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> also follows on from the preceding figure ‘Anger’, as Hildegard explains 
later, ‘because when a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> shows joy after being angry, he humiliates his enemies, who feel the insults 
heaped <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them all the more strongly when they see him happy’. 

17. the response of the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> from the storm-cloud: The seventh virtue is ‘Desire for God’. 


28. The <span class="t23 hoverable">Voice</span> from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> (from The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits ) 


1. black schism : Possibly a reference to the eighteen-year schism between Pope Alexander <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> and Emperor 
Frederick Barbarossa which began in 1159, shortly after Hildegard had started <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits. 

2. man... lion... ox... eagle... four: The four images of the man, the lion, the bull and the eagle from Ezekiel 1:10 
were traditionally interpreted as symbols of the four evangelists, for instance in the iconography of the 
illuminated gospel books of the early Middle Ages. In Hildegard these become theological symbols, each using 
traditional animal imagery to illustrate aspects of God: his goodness, power, sacrifice, and knowledge. 

3. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the activity of God. ..from God: The same idea is basic to the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of the trilogy, The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> 
of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Works. 

4. For he alone knows all things... grace: Hildegard has a strong <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t17 t19 t25 t26 hoverable">sense</span> of immanence, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is present and 
actively at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the world. 

5. ‘The Lord... his enemies’: Isaiah 42:13. Hildegard has <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the image of the ‘mighty man’ from Isaiah and 
adapted it to her own vision, as she explains in the following paragraphs. 

6. Before the ancient days... destruction: A contrast is made between the heights of the Lord’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> - as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to 
the living - and the carelessness of Pride ‘who attempts to climb before he has seen the ladder’. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Note</span> also in this 
<span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> the key concept of the ‘ancient counsel’ or plan that has been prepared beforehand against the forces of 
pride. 

7. But he prepared his quiver and arrows... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> of war: This is the traditional patristic image of the devil as an 
archer (Psalm 11:2 in the Authorized Version), here attempting to have his revenge for the fall from heaven. 

8. He then <span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> up ‘the Word... never cease: The idea that ‘the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> shall go forth as a mighty man’ is linked now 
to the incarnation of Christ, when ‘the Word... became flesh’ (John 1:14). The battle with the enemy is seen as 
one of active <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> against idle and inactive evil, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> becomes a prophecy of the apocalypse. 

9. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is of such stature’... and no end: At this point Hildegard returns to the details of the opening vision 
and explains them step by step, beginning with some reflections for the reader on how the eternity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is to 
be understood. 

10. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is eternal... a flaming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in judgement: By a series of associated images Hildegard connects eternity 
with fire, God’s power, rational thought, the senses, and judgement. A key influence is Psalm 104, the <span class="t4 hoverable">hymn</span> to 
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> and renewal from the Psalms, especially the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> ‘Who maketh... his ministers a flaming fire’ (Psalm 
104: 4; Authorized Version).

employed allegorically for a discussion of salvation history and the purgation of sin. In the allegory, the 
shoulders of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> represent the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Moses, as in the biblical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> Hildegard is about to discuss in 
paragraph 26, ‘the government shall be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his shoulder’ (Isaiah 9:6). 

12. on the shoulder of his strength: Hildegard’s style here is extremely allusive and associative, but the main 
message seems to be that the shoulder is a symbol for the strength and justice of Christ. 

13. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the venomous seed of a man: The doctrine of the ‘venomous seed of a man’ contrasts with more 
positive views of sexuality, for instance in Hildegard’s Causes and Cures.

acquaintance with reflections on language, in particular the difference between a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> as an abstract meaning- 
bearing entity and the spoken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> as a sound perceived by the senses and subject to the limitations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and 
space. Hildegard’s source, however, remains unclear, for unlike many early medieval writers she does not cite 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> passages from her authorities. Ultimately, the influence of Augustine is apparent, for instance his

of the body. 

17. From his knees to the calves of his legs he is in the earth.’... their sustenance: Hildegard draws an analogy 
between the supporting knees of the cosmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> and the sustaining strength of the earth, both of which can 
flex under pressure and then return afterwards to their ‘rightful condition’. 

18. So also the Church... endure invincible: Having <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> up the image of the flexible knees, Hildegard now applies 
it on a prophetic level to the ‘New Nation’, that is the Church, which will come under pressure during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

19. She will stand firmly on her feet: Just as the cosmic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> ‘rests in his mysteries’, so the Church in the last

20. ‘Who <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> measured... depth of the abyss?’ : From the Old Testament Apocrypha - the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> 
literature known as Ecclesiasticus (or Sirach) 1:3. 

21. It was Wisdom... penetrated the abyss: In Ecclesiasticus 24:5, <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Wisdom</span> speaks: ‘I alone compassed the 
circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep.’ 

22. your ways are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> and just: See Revelation 16:7. In the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> following, the biblical quotation is 
expanded into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> prayer spoken on behalf of erring humanity who need to realize the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that the Lord’s

23. the mountain, which is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of God: The image of the mountain as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> can be 
compared with the mountain in Scivias 1 , 1 (25), or in the description of the cosmic egg in Scivias I, 3 (20), or in 
the letters to Henry, Bishop of Liege or Prior Dimo (14, 30). 

24. ‘He <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> hidden words, which it is not permitted for anyone to speak’: II Corinthians 12:4. Hildegard at no 
point states clearly that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ‘caught up into paradise’ in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> refers to the Apostle Paul, which is the 
traditional <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of this passage. Instead, Hildegard expands on the notion of ‘hidden words’ that are revealed to 
visionaries, as in her own case, and it is tempting to relate this <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> to her short treatise on the ‘unknown 
language’ which she wrote in the 1150s before starting on The <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Life’s Merits.

listed above suggest influence from Latin or German, e.g. vanix, ‘woman’, perhaps from Latin vanitas, ‘vanity’, 
falschin, ‘poet’, perhaps from Middle <span class="t23 hoverable">High</span> German valsch, ‘false’, and sonziz, ‘apostle’, possibly related to the 
sonus or ‘sacred sound’ to which Hildegard frequently referred. For more information on Hildegard’s language,

Unknown Language] (Basel, 1986).

9. <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> is my matter: Hildegard’s idea of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t12 t15 t16 t17 t19 t22 t24 t25 t26 hoverable">creation</span> from ‘matter’, or material, includes the idea of the maternal,

15. base matter: Latin ‘materia’, with connotations of mater, ‘mother’. 

16. ‘Let it be done’: Latin fiat’, as in Genesis 1:3, ‘Let there be light’. 

17. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> said... at my right hand’: Psalm 109:1 (Vulgate) or 110:1 (Authorized Version).

32. Queries and Requests: Selected Letters to Hildegard 


1. correspondents: Further information on the recipients and personalities involved is given in the Glossary. For 
convenience, the letters selected have been numbered according to the edition by Lieven Van Acker, Hildegardis 
Bingensis Epistolarium CCCM 9i-9ia (Turnhout,i99i and 1993) and the translation by Joseph L. Baird and 
Radd K. Ehrman, The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen, 2 vols (Oxford, 1994 and 1998). Van Acker’s arrangement 
follows the hierarchical ranking of the letters as preserved in the major manuscript collection, rather than the 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> in which they were written. Since many of the letters cannot be dated precisely, the chronological <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> 
attempted in this selection should be seen as only approximate. 

2. Bernard of Clairvaux...: For Hildegard’s request for support, see 1, Letter 1. 

3. ‘God opposes... the humble’: Proverbs 3:34, quoted in James 4:6 and I Peter 5:5.

7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Hezekiah... angered the Lord: See Isaiah 39:2-8. Odo is using the example of Hezekiah to warn 
Hildegard against the dangers of revealing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> treasures to opponents.

The idea is common also in 
Hildegard’s writings. 

9. ‘the woman thatfeareth the Lord, she shall be praise’: Proverbs 31:30. 

10. the melodies of a new song: The allusion to Hildegard’s compositions shows that she was already writing 
songs by the late 1140s. 

11. many scholars argue that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> is not identical with both paternity and divinity: This was one of the theses 
of Gilbert Porreta, Bishop of Poitiers. 

12. Heinrich, Archbishop of Mainz...: For Hildegard’s aggressive reply, see 12. 

13. a sister... in your monastery: The reference is to Richardis of Stade. 

14. Henry, Bishop of Liege...: For Hildegard’s reply, see 14. 

15. Arnold, Archbishop of Cologne...: Hildegard’s short reply is quoted in the introduction to 16. 

16. the book... interference: A reference to Scivias, probably the most widely known of Hildegard’s books during 
her lifetime. 

17. Gertrud ( ofStahleck )...: Hildegard sent an encouraging response; see 18. 

18. ‘things... <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of man’: I Corinthians 2:9. 

19. the wine of sorrow : I follow here the translation by Baird and Ehrman, in The Letters, vol. 1. 

20. the one whom I desire: Song of Songs 2:3: ‘As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved 
among the sons. I sat down under his shadow whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.’ 

21 .Abbess of... Bamberg...: For Hildegard’s reply see 19. 

22. An Abbess ofAltena...: Hildegard’s response is allegorical and does not quite match the personal tone of the 
abbess’s letter; see 30, Letter 49R. 

23. sitting with Mary at the feet of Christ: Probably a reference to Mary Magdalene (see Matthew 27:61); the 
imagery of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> the beloved derives from interpretations of the Song of Songs. 

24. secret chamber of your heart: Perhaps a reference to the story of Judith in the Old Testament Apocrypha. 
See, for instance, Judith 8:5 in the <span class="t28 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> Bible. 

25. tasted... sweet: Psalm 34:8. 

26. face to face: I Corinthians 13:12. 

27. Eberhard, Archbishop of Salzburg...: For the allegory Hildegard wrote in response, see 30, Letter 25R. 

28. you will enter... heavenly bridegroom: An allusion to the parable of the Five <span class="t8 t12 t17 hoverable">Wise</span> Virgins, who bought oil 
for their lamps so that when the bridegroom came they were ready, and ‘they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> in with him to the marriage’, 


while the five foolish virgins remained outside, with no oil for their lamps. See Matthew 25:1-12. 

29. the Emperor’s court at Mainz: Emperor Frederick Barbarossa held royal audiences at various intervals in 
different locations throughout the empire. This occasion, in 1163, was particularly important for Hildegard 
because she received an imperial deed of protection for the Rupertsberg convent. Eberhard’s name appears 
among the many names of witnesses to the deed, which also include Archbishop Conrad of Mainz, Archbishop 
Eberhard of Bamberg and Bishop Henry of Liege. 

30. under a seal: Eberhard wants a sealed letter in reply for extra security. He himself was in a difficult political 
situation: as a friend of the Emperor, he nevertheless supported Pope Alexander <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> against the antipope Victor 
IV. 

31 .Abbot Adam...: Adam’s letter provoked a fascinating letter in reply; see 30, Letter 85R/A. 

32. rejoiced with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> joy : The wording is biblical. Cf. Matthew 2:10: ‘And seeing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> star, they rejoiced

33. allow your <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> to be <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> in our land: A reference to Hildegard’s first preaching tour, between 1158 and 
1161.

ARNOLD, ARCHBISHOP OF COLOGNE Archbishop of Cologne before Rainald of Dassel, Arnold wrote to 
Hildegard requesting a copy of Scivias (see 32 and, for Hildegard’s response, 16). 

ARNOLD, ARCHBISHOP OF MAINZ (Served as Archbishop 1153-60) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> regarded by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Conrad III, he was

the community. During his period in office, he came into conflict with the Count Palatine Hermann of 
Stahleck and also had problems raising the tribute for Barbarossa’s Italian expeditions. On 1 November 1159 
he placed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">city</span> of Mainz under excommunication before joining Barbarossa in Italy. On his return 
the dispute worsened and Arnold was killed during the violence that followed. 



AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO (354-430) St Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in North Africa, is probably the most famous 
of the four ‘Doctors of the Church’. His influence was enormous, and his numerous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> include

of worship and prayer divided into eight ‘offices’: matins at the end of the night, lauds at daybreak, prime, 
terce, sext and none during the day, vespers in the evening, and compline at sunset. The offices during the 
hours of daylight were interspersed with periods of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and reading. Hildegard wrote a commentary on the 
Rule, probably in the period 1151-8. 

BERNARD OF CHARTRES (c. 1080-c. 1130) From c. 1114, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of the famous cathedral school of Chartres. 
According to one of his pupils, John of Salisbury, Bernard revered the arts and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of ancient Greece 
and Rome which he saw as far exceeding that of his own day; for Bernard, his contemporaries were ‘dwarfs, 
standing on the shoulders of the giants’. 

BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX (1090-1153) <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">Born</span> in Burgundy, Bernard of Fontaines became famous under the 
name of the Cistercian monastery he founded in 1115 and ruled as abbot until his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> in 1153. The most 
important Cistercian of his time, he wrote numerous works, including letters, sermons, satirical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> and 
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> writings. An ascetic in his early years, Bernard became more politically involved after 1128, 
intervening in disputes between important figures in the Church. In 1140 his influence led to the 
condemnation of the teachings of Peter Abelard at the Council of Sens. After the election in 1145 of Pope 
Eugenius III, a Cistercian from Clairvaux, Bernard undertook preaching tours against heresy in the 
Languedoc, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Albis. From 1146 to 1147 he preached the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Crusade, which 
subsequently failed in 1149. In this period he secured the acceptance of Hildegard’s writings at the Synod of 
Trier (1147-8). 

BERNARD SILVESTER Bernardus Silvestris, poet and philosopher. Of the same generation as William of 
Conches, Gilbert of Poitiers and John of Salisbury. Little is known of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> apart from reminiscences of 
contemporaries. He taught at Tours, probably between 1130 and 1140, and had some connections with 
Chartres. His major <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is the allegorical poem Cosmographia. 

BESANQON A papal embassy from Hadrian IV met Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his chancellor, Rainald 
of Dassel, at the Diet (Assembly) of Besangon in October 1157, and a dispute arose over <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> the emperor 
should receive the imperial crown as a benefice (Latin beneficium) from the pope. Part of the problem may 
have been Rainald’s inflammatory translation of the ambiguous term benficium as ‘fief rather than as ‘gift’.

BONIFACE, SAINT (c. 675-754) Wynfrith of Wessex, England, later known as Saint Boniface. The ‘Apostle of 
Germany’, he was martyred in 754 at Dokkum in Frisia. In c. 746 he had become the first Archbishop of 
Mainz. Since her convent lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> the diocese of Mainz, Hildegard held the memory of Boniface in 
particular respect and wrote an antiphon in his honour.

imperial chancellor and general of Frederick’s forces. He helped effect a reconciliation between the Emperor 
and the Pope at Venice in 1177 and was away in Rome when the prelates of Mainz imposed the interdict on 
the Rupertsberg in 1179. Hildegard eventually wrote to Christian asking him to lift the ban, and Christian 
agreed, placing the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of Philip, Archbishop of Cologne, the neighbouring diocese. But at 
the intervention of one of the Mainz prelates, the interdict was reinstated. Only after Hildegard had appealed

CONRAD, ARCHBISHOP OF MAINZ (1161-5 and 1183-1200) Conrad (or Konrad) of Wittelsbach, brother of 
Duke Otto of Bavaria. Conrad is one of the named witnesses of the imperial edict of protection for the 
Rupertsberg convent on 14 April 1163. Although his election as Archbishop of Mainz had been pushed by 
Frederick Barbarossa, Conrad nevertheless supported the Pope, and in 1164 on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the antipope 
Victor IV urged Barbarossa to come to terms with Alexander III. On 23 May 1165, at the imperial court held 
in Wiirzburg, he refused to recognize the new antipope Paschal III; Barbarossa reacted by removing him 
from office and replacing him with Christian de Buch. Conrad fled to Alexander in France and then to Rome, 
where he was appointed Cardinal Bishop of S. Sabina. From 1169 he was active as a papal legate, and after 
the <span class="t13 hoverable">Peace</span> of Venice in 1177, he renounced his claim to the archbishopric of Mainz until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of

The anchorage eventually 
became a community of nuns with Jutta as abbess; in effect, the institution became a double monastery of 
monks and nuns under the final authority of the abbot. Hildegard succeeded Jutta as abbess of the convent 
in 1136, remaining there until she founded the autonomous community on the Rupertsberg in about 1150. 

EBERHARD, BISHOP OF BAMBERG Elected Bishop in 1146 and consecrated by Pope Eugenius III. Eberhard 
had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> relations with Frederick Barbarossa, taking part in the Italian campaigns, and as a reward for his 
support, the abbey of Niederalteich was placed under the control of the bishopric of Bamberg. In 1157 he 
responded to a request from Hildegard and provided a building in Bamberg as a new convent for the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of 
Gertrud of Stahleck and her fellow nuns. In 1163 he was the fifth witness on the imperial deed of protection 
for the Rupertsberg. 

EBERHARD, BISHOP OF SALZBURG <span class="t16 t24 hoverable">Born</span> in 1085, Eberhard of Biburg and Hipoltstein became a canon in 
Bamberg, a monk at Priifening and then an abbot of Biburg in the diocese of Regensburg. On 22 May 1149, 
he was consecrated Bishop of Salzburg. Politically active, his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> pleased Conrad III, although he did not 
frequent the imperial court as much as his friend Eberhard of Bamberg. During the schism, he supported 
Pope Alexander <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> and opposed the election of antipopes such as Victor IV in 1162. Nevertheless, he 
remained a presence among Frederick Barbarossa’s followers and acted as a mediator between emperor and 
pope. In 1163, he attended the imperial court at Mainz, and was the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> witness on the imperial deed of 
protection for the Rupertsberg. 

ECKBERT (EKBERT) OF SCHONAU (d.1184) Writer and preacher. Brother and adviser of the visionary 

Elisabeth of Schonau. From 1140 to 1146 he studied in Paris, where he was friends with Rainald of Dassel. 

He subsequently became a canon at St Cassius in Bonn, but after a pilgrimage to Rome in 1155 he became a 
priest and then, after persuasion by Elisabeth, a monk, joining the double monastery at Schonau. He 
eventually became abbot there. Among his many writings, he composed Thirteen Sermons against the 
Cathars, and he preached against this movement at Bonn before 1153, at Cologne in 1163 and at Koblenz in 
1167. 

EIBINGEN Founded by Hildegard c. 1165; a daughter monastery of the Rupertsberg. 

ELISABETH OF SCHONAU (d. 1164) A visionary author who, like many others, experienced most of her visions 
in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of ecstatic trance (in marked contrast to Hildegard’s waking state). From 1147 a nun at Schonau. 
Her early visions, from 1152 to 1155, are devotional pieces on the lives of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> and Mary. But from 1155, 
she employed her brother Eckbert to put her compositions down in writing, and under his influence the 
writings become more theological and doctrinal. Her main <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> are a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> influenced by Scivias known as

doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Mary (1156-9). Elisabeth corresponded with the older Hildegard for 
support and encouragement. She became magistra (abbess) of her community in 1157. 

ERIGENA (ERIUGENA) John the Scot (c. 810-c. 877). Theologian and philosopher who attempted to reconcile 
the Neoplatonist idea of emanation (i.e. the origin of everything that exists from the One) with the Christian 
idea of creation. His greatest work, Periphyseon, or the Division of Nature, was possibly known to 
Hildegard; she perhaps knew his ideas through excerpts in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of Honorius of Autun.

Abbey of Clairvaux under Bernard. On his election as Pope he refused to recognize the Roman Senate and 
had to flee from Rome to Farfa and Viterbo and then in 1147 to France, where he commissioned Bernard to 
preach the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Crusade. Eugenius held synods at Paris (1147), Trier (1147-8) where he personally read 
out and approved Hildegard’s writings, Rheims (1148) where Gilbert Porreta’s writings were scrutinized for 
heresy, and Cremona (1148), where he excommunicated Arnold of Brescia, now leader of the Senate. In 1149 
he was able to return briefly to Rome, and again in 1153, when he died there. Essentially a reformer and 
pious Cistercian, he exchanged a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of letters with Hildegard after the Synod of Trier. 

FREDERICK BARBAROSSA, OR FREDERICK 1 (c. 1122-90) Frederick (Friedrich) of Swabia. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> and Emperor

through his mother, a Guelph (Welf), and his father, a Hohenstaufen. In 1153 he signed a treaty of mutual

Hadrian IV, who honoured the Treaty of Constance. But relations between emperor and pope soon changed. 
Hadrian changed his policies and became reconciled with the Norman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of Sicily, William I, at the

1157, Frederick insisted on the emperor’s rule of a ‘holy empire’, as against the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> jurisdiction of the

military action by imperial troops in German lands against monastic supporters of the pope. With the aim of 
establishing an imperial <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> in Lombardy, Barbarossa undertook six major Italian expeditions. In 1162 he 
<span class="t0 t7 t11 t13 t14 t22 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">took</span> Milan. In 1167 he captured Rome, but had to withdraw because of a malaria epidemic. In the end, he

Pope Alexander III. In 1181 he overthrew a rival in Germany, Henry the Lion, the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">head</span> of the Welf dynasty,

Frederick Barbarossa died while on the <span class="t7 hoverable">Third</span> Crusade in 1189. 

GEBENO OF EBERBACH Eberbach, in the Rheingau, was a large Cistercian monastery with which Hildegard 
had personal contacts. She wrote to Abbot Ruthard in the 1150s and sent a letter of encouragement to the 
monks in the 1160s, a period when monasteries supporting the pope suffered oppression from imperial 
troops. In 1220, Prior Gebeno of Eberbach composed his Mirror of Future Times, or Pentachronon (i.e. The 
Five Ages), much of which consists of extracts from Hildegard’s apocalyptic or prophetic writings, including 
such correspondence as the letter to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Conrad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> (c. 1150; 34) and the letter to the Cologne clerics (c.

Friend and correspondent 
of Hildegard. Her husband Hermann of Stahleck was a generous supporter of Hildegard’s convent at 
Rupertsberg. After his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> in 1156, Gertrud became a nun first at Wechterswinkel in the diocese of 
Wurzburg and then, after Hildegard’s intervention with Bishop Eberhard of Bamberg, at the new foundation 
of St Theodore and St Mary at Bamberg. 

GILBERT PORRETA (c. 1080-1154) Otherwise known as Gilbert de la Porree or Gilbert of Poitiers. Biblical 
commentator and scholastic theologian. After studying under Bernard of Chartres and Anselm of Laon, he 
became a well-known <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> at Paris. In 1142 he was appointed Bishop of Poitiers. Interested in logic and 
the language of theology, his statements in his commentary on Boethius’s opuscula that ‘God is one’ and 
‘God is three’ led to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> controversy, particularly at the Synod of Rheims in 1148. Hildegard was involved in 
this debate when asked for advice on the <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> by a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t12 t17 t19 t20 t27 t29 hoverable">master</span> of Paris, Odo of Soissons, in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> 
between 1148 and 1150 (see 32; and for Hildegard’s reply, see 4). 

GOTTFRIED OF DISIBODENBERG (Latin name: Godefridus monachus) The monk of Disibodenberg who 
became Hildegard’s secretary in 1174, a year after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Volmar.

the Moralia (a commentary on Job), homilies on the gospels, and the Pastoral Care, a guide to the 
psychology of teaching and ministry. 

GREGORY VII, POPE (1073-85) Hildebrand, a native of Tuscany (born between 1015 and 1034), became one of 
the most influential popes of the period. At the Lenten Synod of 1074, he issued decrees against simony, i.e. 
the payment of money to promote <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to <span class="t1 t5 t11 t16 hoverable">higher</span> offices in the Church, and against clerical marriage. He 



also sought to gain exclusive control over the appointment of bishops. This led to the ‘investiture 
controversy’, for he was almost immediately opposed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the German Empire, Henry IV, who

reacted by electing their own ‘antipopes’. 

GREGORY IX (c. 1148-1241) Pope from 1227. During his pontificate, in 1233, the canonization protocol was 
commissioned to provide evidence for Hildegard’s sanctity. This was rejected on its completion and returned 
for revision in 1237, but the revised version apparently never reached Pope Innocent IV, who wrote a letter 
in 1243 asking for the new claim to be submitted. 

GUIBERT OF GEMBLOUX (German name: Wibert) (1124/5-1213) Writer and monk of Gembloux near Namur 
in Flanders. Extremely learned, he was considerably influenced by the Latin classics in his style of writing. 
During the 1170s, Hildegard’s reputation reached Guibert and he became a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> admirer of her work. From 
1175, therefore, he began a correspondence with her which culminated in a visit to the Rupertsberg in the 
autumn of that year. He also prepared the Thirty-Eight Questions with the monks of the monastery of 
Villers and sent it to Hildegard in 1176. From 1177 Guibert served as Hildegards secretary until her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> in 
1179; he returned to Gembloux in 1180. In 1188/9 he was Abbot of Florennes near Namur and then from 
1194 Abbot of Gembloux. 

HADRIAN IV, POPE (c. 1100-59) Nicholas Breakspear, the only English Pope. In 1154, he secured the expulsion 
of Arnold of Brescia from Rome and in 1155 obtained homage from Frederick Barbarossa before agreeing to 
his coronation as Emperor. In 1157 his legates met Frederick at Besangon and delivered his claim that the 
Emperor held his position as a ‘benefice’ from the Pope. This led to a severe dispute, which eventually 
became a schism during the pontificate of Alexander III. Hildegard wrote an admonitory letter to him on his 
election to the papal see in 1154. 

HARTWIG, ARCHBISHOP OF BREMEN Hartwig of Stade, Archbishop of Bremen 1148-68. His sister was 

Richardis of Stade, the nun and friend of Hildegard at Disibodenberg. Their parents were Rudolf I, Margrave 
of Stade in North Germany (d. 1124) and Margravine (or Marchioness) Richardis, originally of Spanheim- 
Lavanttal (d. 1151); the Margravine’s <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> cousin was Jutta of Spanheim.

Rudolf in 1144, Hartwig was involved in an inheritance dispute with Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, who

conflict was later renewed. Henry installed an antipope Clement <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">III</span> at Rome in 1084, who crowned him

his honour at the Rupertsberg. 

RUPERTSBERG A hill overlooking the junction of the River Nahe with the Rhine at Bingen. The site of a shrine 
to Saint Rupert which was destroyed by the Vikings in the ninth century. Hildegard decided to locate her 
independent monastery there and moved from the Disibodenberg with a group of her nuns in about 1150. 

RUPERTSBERG SCIVIAS, THE The famous Rupertsberg copy of Scivias (Wiesbaden, Hessische 

Landesbibliothek, manuscript 1) with illustrations done by artists probably under the direction of Hildegard 
herself. Lost in 1945, its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and artwork are preserved in photocopies and a colour facsimile at the Abbey of 
St Hildegard at Eibingen.

SCIVIAS (‘KNOW THE WAYS’) Hildegard’s first major <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> (1141-51), an encyclopedic survey of salvation

respectively. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> survives in ten complete manuscripts, six of them from the twelfth century, including 
the illustrated Rupertsberg and Salem manuscripts. 

TENGSWICH OF ANDERNACH Tengswich, or Tengswindis, was Mistress of Sankt Marien, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of canons 
regular at Andernach in the Rhine Valley north of Bingen. In a letter dated 1148-50 (no. 52 in the Collected 
Letters ), Tengswich criticized Hildegard’s hierarchical attitudes, in particular her refusal to allow girls from 
lower down the social scale to join her community at Disibodenberg. She also asked <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that

question, it is thought, may reflect accounts <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> by Tengswich of a performance of The Play of the Virtues.

translation by Chalcidius. 

URSULA, SAINT According to the legend current in Hildegard’s day, St Ursula was a British princess of the dark 



ages who renounced her marriage and travelled with 11,000 virgins on a pilgrimage to Rome. On their return 
journey, they were massacred by the barbarian Huns at Cologne. In the early twelfth century an old 
cemetery was uncovered in which they were supposedly buried, and their relics, a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> token of their 
virtue and influence, were widely distributed.
