Introduction
Kaivalya, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> itself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> solitary or alone.
The ultimate <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of Kaivalya is the full understanding of
the reality of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> “I Alone am <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Existence”.
The Kaivalya Upanishad is an advanced philosophy and is in
reply to the plea of Ashvalayana, already advanced in both
<span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> and practice. Ashvalayana askes for the full
understanding and realisation of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of his non-dual
identity with the Absolute <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> or God.
It is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> that the wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> their own “self” in all
<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> all <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> as their own “self”, which, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span>
the apparent duality of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> all are one. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
this understanding has <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> enough.
However, the Kaivalya Upanishad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> us to understand
more than just that, hence the reason for its existence.
The Sage of the Kaivalya Upanishad <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> knows that The
Singularity of Existence, The Absolute Itself, is not Realised
through that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> alone. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Realisation is of the
primal singularity of Existence which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> origination.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Realisation arises from the conscious awareness that
this very awareness itself is all there is, all else is an
assumption of the senses and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span>
consciousness. Consciousness is not shared by “others”.
To turn within, <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and “others” needs the

refined intuitive discrimination to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that this <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span>
does lie within. Turning <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> a decision that needs
the resilient faith to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> alone through all doubt.
The Kaivalya Upanishad talks of the last stage of full
realisation, gaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and understanding that
completes and frees the Realised to emerge Alone from
duality as One, as The Absolute.
Concerning the completion of our journey, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> seems
propitious to consider this Upanishad to help illuminate the
basic motivation and <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of all students. Through grace <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> feel troubled, causing pause for thought, allowing the
insight to arise that something is missing, that this living is not
satisfying our <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> purpose. In our more introspective or
intuitive moments most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> admit to the feeling that
there is <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> the seed of a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> or a nobility of
purpose. The initial impulse to seek <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is the
germination of this seed. This causes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to turn to a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span>
life. Whether you are then drawn to Teacher, Church,
Temple, Mosque or Synagogue you are being moved to seek
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of truth. From then on what is needed is the
nourishment and nurturing of this seed through to fruition,
through to Kaivalya.
Lastly, but of utmost <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> and importance.
Considering the terms solitary, alone, Kaivalya. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be
understood <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> from the beginning that these terms,

aloneness and so <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> are merely terms of duality in
themselves.
Ironically, these terms are only relevant to the state of duality
and forgetting that we are in <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> now. You can feel alone
now, this is why the consideration of Absolute Aloneness
causes profound fear or sadness. But, after the proper
Realisation of your Solitary Existence you will <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> feel or
be alone again, because aloneness will not exist.
Consider, fear itself in all its forms only arises <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span>
duality. This is because duality itself only exists through the
forgetting of our non-dual identity with or as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Absolute or God. Once the Absolute, God, The primal
singularity of Existence is realised the state of one’s existence
is Absolutely Complete.
After this Realisation, Aloneness or Solitary or Kaivalya
does not exist because they are relative terms. All will be
well.

1. Then Ashvalayana addressed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>
and said: “Teach, O Lord, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

“Then Ashvalayana addressed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>

highest”
When Ashvalayana is moved to sound his desire for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and union with the Absolute it is that seed of
Divinity that is maturing. Kaivalya itself is the fruition of
purpose and realisation of life’s journey.
“always cultivated by the good”.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Absolute which Ashvalayana desires is
that same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and wise cultivate or

can discriminate between transient material <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> and eternal
truth.
The intuition that this <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> exists is the beginning of
wisdom.
“secret”
That described as secret <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that understanding that is
subtle and can only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> ones own self, arising

scriptures.

<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> is seen or discriminated through the cleansed Buddhi or
intellect. This <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> of Non-Duality contains the

“The Absolute <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the high”.
This is a plea for freedom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> weary

reflect the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> truth.
It is for our benefit here that Ashvalayana seeks and receives
the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> that sets you free and as an example he is willing to
suffer any trial to attain that truth.

values to delude us into believing our purpose is the material
“success” of accumulating worldly knowledge, wealth fame
and power.
It is the delusion of duality that causes the seeing of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> as
separate existences from ourselves. Duality is the forgetting
of the underlying unity of all existence, this forgetting gives
rise to the fear of inadequacy that causes the need or desire to
collect material wealth for protection and status. It is only
through duality that inadequacy can be experienced,
inadequacy imagines the need for <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and increase. The

The Kaivalya Upanishad here describes the Ascetic having
undertaken the path of the Sannyasin. Through contemplation,
meditation and complete disentanglement from the sensual and
material world, the intellect of the heart, Buddhi, has been
purified enabling proper discrimination for the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of the
“self” to be intuitively seen, This <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> then becomes the
proper guide enabling the realisation of the Absolute Self.

The ascetic seeking the Absolute Alone is most complete
<span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the Solitariness of his own self.
Here the ascetic is described in the meditating posture sitting
in seclusion. No other <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> will be undertaken other than that
necessary for the facilitation of meditation.

This is the decision of the sage. “Having controlled all the
senses” the sage is now free from the delusion of desire so
now naturally renounces the material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as unreal and

“saluting his own teacher with reverence”.
The sage will always be available for his teachers and his
realisation of unity will contain insight and understanding of
how he or she received that truth.
“meditating <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the lotus of the <span class="t0 t5 t6 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> on The
Absolute”.
Here the “lotus of the heart” refers to the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> intellect or
Buddhi. Buddhi is the subtle quality of being that, in
stillness, has access to “Absolute Knowledge” through which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> reason and discrimination can reveal the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of the
Absolute Itself.
It is from meditation that is free from Manas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and

is seen or realised through intuition.
With Realisation comes the awareness of this singularity or
Non-Duality. That Singularity is seen as This Alone and all
else falls away.
“untainted, pure, clear”.
In the course of everyday <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is “tainted” through the
perception of duality with its desires and fears.
The sage of this verse, having Realised the reality of NonDuality and the Consciousness of the Absolute becomes free
“untainted” and “pure” of the impediments of duality.
The sage so liberated has clarity of perception, his
understanding is “clear”.
“without sorrow”.

“Sorrow” is a product of attachment and the taints of duality,
it is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of this material Creation.
The Realised Sage of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> is “without sorrow” because
due to his clarity of understanding he now sees and renounces
this material <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> along with its sorrows or joys as unreal
and undesirable.
Accordingly the sage renounces the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the senses

practice turns to the Absolute within.

endless forms, the good, the peaceful,
Immortal, the origin of the worlds,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> beginning, middle, and end, the
only one, all-pervading, Consciousness,
and Bliss, the formless and the wonderful.
“He is the unthinkable”.
The Absolute is in fact “yourself”. You are the Absolute
because the Absolute is all this very Existence. Through the
delusion of Maya there is an experience <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> consciousness
of duality and a “self”, nevertheless there is but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
Consciousness so the experience in consciousness of a
thinking “self” is in reality merely a projection by the
Absolute “Self”.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that the projected experience of a “self” thinking

cannot logically encompass that “Absolute Self” that projects
that very thinking experience.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the Non-Dual Absolute ItSelf <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be truly

It is for the above reason that any meditation practice that

Understanding that the Absolute source of all is a singularity
the sage reaches that singularity through Realising his own

identity as that Solitary singularity.

this fact is based the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> understanding.

The term “Knowing Him” <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to have Realised the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of

understand that all that he is, is but The Absolute Itself
Alone, this is the fact of Non-Duality. Knowing this the
Realised Sage knows himself to be Eternal (“transcends

“There is no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to freedom”

This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> that this Singularity of Existence has to be <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>

forms as <span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> existences. He regards his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as
being the reality of who he is, “identifies himself with the
body”.
Moving as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and seeing only through his senses he

imagines himself as the “doer” and achiever of his own
desires.
“In the waking state it is the jiva who attains
satisfaction through the varied objects of enjoyment, such
as women, food and drink”.
The waking state is the experience in consciousness of an
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> interacting with the material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> looking after
his needs. Pleasure is mistakenly seen as gain by those so
deluded by duality and the consequent needs of their own
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> ego. The desires of the ego covered by ignorance
can be limitless, resulting in seeking sex, food, drink,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and so <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> for personal satisfaction and
aggrandisement, the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> for which arises from the
ignorance of duality and their need to assert themselves as
individuals.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> that accepts the duality of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> as Reality and his
master, will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> his “self” as his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to satisfy his desires
<span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> Creation.

13. In the dream-state that jiva feels
pleasure and pain in a sphere of existence
created by his own Maya or ignorance.
During the state of deep sleep, when
everything is absorbed (into their causal
state), he is overpowered by tamas or non-

manifestation and comes to exist in his
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Bliss.
“In the dream-state that jiva feels pleasure and pain
in a sphere of existence created by his own Maya or
ignorance”.
The dream state is the experience in consciousness of living
<span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> ones own <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> of events and phenomena. This
individual, this deluded jiva consciousness, suffers the same
results of his delusions in the dream state as he does in the
waking state, due to both states being as a dream, (as Maya),
merely a projection of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> Consciousness of Reality.
This is due to the dream state being the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of that same
consciousness and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> limited by the delusion of
duality with its resultant desires.
“During the state of deep sleep, when everything is
absorbed (into their causal state)”
During the state of deep sleep the jiva is divested of attributes
such as delusion, ignorance, individuality, desires and so
forth. In deep sleep <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> seems as that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> Alone, free from
desiring and apparently blissful.
“he is overpowered by tamas or non-manifestation
and comes to exist in his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Bliss”.
This apparent bliss is only due to the unawareness and
subsequent ignorance of deep sleep, “his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of bliss”.
Only the Absolute Consciousness is true. All “states” of

consciousness are a projection of delusion. <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">Within</span> this
delusion beings “live” their experiences.

14. Again, through his connection with
deeds done in previous births, that very
jiva returns to the dream-state, or the
waking state. The being who sports in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> cities, the states of wakefulness,
dream and deep sleep, from Him has
sprung up all diversity. He is the
substratum, the bliss, the indivisible
Consciousness, in whom the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> cities
dissolve themselves.
“Again, through his connection with deeds done in
previous births that very jiva returns to the dream-state, or
the waking state”.
This statement refers to the experience of rebirth <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
consciousness that failed to realise the Non-Dual Absolute
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the form.
The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is that due to consciousness still being deluded
through desire and duality it was lead back to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of
achieving those material desires, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the
consciousness of material creation.
“The being who sports in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> cities, the states
of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep, from Him has

sprung up all diversity”
This statement is Confirmation that the being who desires is
the being who is reborn into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> cities of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span>
(“wakefulness, dream and deep sleep”).
The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is that the desires that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> rebirth are the very
desires that <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> of the material realm (“all
diversity”) in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to accommodate the desirous being.
“He is the substratum, the bliss”,
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> confirms the Absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> as the substratum for
this dualistic <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of the ignorant. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> realisation of the
reality of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> this realised consciousness attains the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span>

“the indivisible Consciousness”,
All the descriptions of “states of being” that are used such as
waking state or dream state or birth experience and so <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span>

“different from them all am I, the Witness”

confirms that the Non-Dual Absolute Consciousness is That
that is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> nor the other “different from them all am

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> is that the “Eternal Good” is all that Exists. It

here “Will” is formed of that very same Absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span>

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that you Alone really exist, because you

Realising the Absolute as “I” all else can be allowed to fall

likewise the greatest of all, I am the

“I am more minute than the minute, I am likewise the
greatest of all”.
The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that the Absolute is beyond measure.
Because the Absolute Alone “is” existence there is not that
other to be greater or smaller. Further, being the entirety of
Existence the Absolute is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exterior or interior.

is the Ancient One. Further, there exists <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> older nor
does there exist anything younger than the Absolute.

The <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> here is that because you are the Solitary totality

Being the <span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> principle itself the Absolute is always
beyond being knowable.
This is the description of the Absolute Self. The Absolute is
“All This”. The wise and Realised Sages, understanding that

Realisation requires surrendering, relinquishing dualistic

false, giving up ambition and desire is as if sawing through
the very branch that is the sole support between the seekers

desiring that <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> felt through the <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of the Absolute, suffer
the heat of this fear and surrender themselves to the reality of
