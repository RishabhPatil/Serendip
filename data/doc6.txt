Dhritarashtra said:
1:1. What did my (people) and the Pandavas do, O
Sangaya! when they assembled <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> on the <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span>
field of Kurukshetra, desirous to do battle?
Sangaya said:
1:2. Seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battlearray, the prince Duryodhana approached his
preceptor, and spoke (these) words:
1:3. `O preceptor! observe this grand army of the <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of

1:12. Then his powerful grandsire, Bhishma, the oldest of
the Kauravas, roaring aloud <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a lion, blew

1:13. And then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and
tabors, and trumpets were played upon; and
there was a tumultuous din.
1:14. Then, too, Madhava and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pandu

learn to refrain from that sin?
1:39. On the extinction of a family, the eternal rites of
families are destroyed. Those rites being
destroyed, impiety predominates over the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> family.
1:40. In consequence of the predominance of impiety, O
Krishna! the women of the family <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
corrupt; and the women becoming corrupt, O descendant
of Vrishni! intermingling of castes results;
1:41. that intermingling necessarily leads the family and
the destroyers of the family to hell; for when the
ceremonies of (offering) the balls of food and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> (to
them) fail, their ancestors fall down (to hell).
1:42. By these transgressions of the destroyers of
families, which occasion interminglings of castes, the
eternal rites of castes and rites of families are subverted.
1:43. And O Ganardana! we have heard that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>

1:44. Alas! we are engaged in committing a heinous sin,
seeing that we are making efforts for killing our
own kinsmen out of greed of the pleasures of sovereignty.
1:45. If the <span class="t5 hoverable">sons</span> of Dhritarashtra, weapon in hand, were
to kill me in battle, me being weaponless and not
defending (myself), that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be better for me.

6:10. A devotee should constantly devote his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> to

unmoved, (remaining) steady, looking at the tip of his
own nose, and not looking about in (all) directions,
6:14. with a tranquil self, devoid of fear, and adhering to
the rules of Brahmakarins, he should restrain
his mind, and (concentrate it) on me, and sit down
engaged in devotion, regarding me as his final goal.
6:15. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> constantly devoting his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> to abstraction, a

addicted to too <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> sleep, nor his who is (ever) awake.
6:17. That devotion which destroys (all) misery is his,
who takes due food and exercise, who toils duly in
all works, and who sleeps and awakes (in) due (time).
6:18. When (a man's) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> restrained becomes

called devotion in which there is a severance of all

6:27. The <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> happiness comes to such a devotee,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is fully tranquil, in whom the quality
of passion has been suppressed, who is free from sin,

6:28. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> constantly devoting his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> to abstraction, a
devotee, freed from sin, easily obtains that
supreme happiness-contact with the Brahman.
6:29. He who has devoted his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> to abstraction, by

abiding in all beings, and all beings in the self.
6:30. To him who sees me in everything, and everything
in me, I am <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> lost, and he is not lost to me.
6:31. The devotee who worships me abiding in all
beings, holding that all is one, lives in me, <span class="t2 t3 t6 t7 t11 t13 t27 hoverable">however</span> he

6:32. That devotee, O Arguna! is deemed to be the best,
who looks alike on pleasure or pain, whatever it

6:33. I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> see, O destroyer of Madhu! (how) the

6:34. For, O Krishna! the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is fickle, boisterous,
strong, and obstinate; and I think that to restrain it is
as difficult as (to restrain) the wind.
The Deity said:
6:35. Doubtless, O you of mighty arms! the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is

indifference (to worldly objects).
6:36. It is my belief, that devotion is hard to obtain for

is self-restrained and assiduous, it can be obtained
through (proper) expedients.
Arguna, said:
6:37. What is the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of him, O Krishna! who does not
attain the consummation of his devotion, being
not assiduous, and having a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> shaken off from

6:39. Be pleased, O Krishna! to entirely destroy this
doubt of mine, for none else than you can destroy
this doubt.
The Deity said:

then again, O descendant of Kuru! he <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> for
perfection.
6:44. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> reluctant, he is led <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> by the

6:45. But the devotee working with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> efforts, and

8:2. And who is the Adhiyagna, and how in this body, O
destroyer of Madhu? And how, too, are you to
be <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of departure (from this world) by

The Deity said:

Adhyatma. The offering (of an oblation to any divinity),
which is the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of the production and
development of all things, is named action.
8:4. The Adhibhuta is all perishable things. The
Adhidaivata is the (primal) being. And the Adhiyagna,
O best of embodied (beings)! is I myself in this body.
8:5. And he who leaves this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and departs (from this

comes into my essence. There is no doubt of that.

8:7. Therefore, at all times remember me, and engage in

possessed of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> hues, with a gaping mouth,

and this charioteer's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> likewise, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with our

their destruction.
11:30. Swallowing all these people, you are licking them
over and over again from all sides, with your
blazing mouths. Your fierce splendours, O Vishnu! filling
the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> universe with (their) effulgence, are
heating it.
11:31. Tell me who you are in this fierce form.
Salutations be to thee, O chief of the gods! Be gracious. I
wish to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> you, the primeval one, for I do not

The Deity said:

developed, and I am now active about the overthrow

11:34. Drona, and Bhishma, and Gayadratha, and Karna,
and likewise other valiant warriors also, whom
I have killed, do you kill. Be not alarmed. Do fight. And
in the battle you will conquer (your) foes.

that which has knowledge, that which is the object of
knowledge, you are the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> goal. By you is this

14:5. Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities born
from nature, O you of mighty arms! bind down

14:6. Of these, goodness, which, in consequence of
being untainted, is enlightening and free from (all)

pleasure and the bond of knowledge.
14:7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Know</span> that passion consists in being enamoured,

it deludes all embodied (selfs). And that, O
descendant of Bharata! binds down (the self) with
heedlessness, indolence, and sleep.
14:9. Goodness unites (the self) with pleasure; passion,
O descendant of Bharata! with action; and
darkness with heedlessness, after shrouding up
knowledge.
14:10. Passion and darkness being repressed, goodness
stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and

14:12. Avarice, activity, performance of actions, want of
tranquillity, desire, these are produced, O chief
of the descendants of Bharata! when passion is
developed.
14:13. Want of light, want of activity heedlessness, and
delusion, these are produced, O descendant of
Kuru! when darkness is developed.
14:14. When an embodied (self) encounters death, while
goodness is developed, then he reaches the
untainted worlds of those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> the highest.

Likewise, dying during (the prevalence of) darkness, he is
born in the wombs of the ignorant.
14:16. The fruit of meritorious action is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be good,
untainted; while the fruit of passion is misery;
and the fruit of darkness ignorance.
14:17. From goodness is produced knowledge, from
passion avarice, and from darkness heedlessness and
delusion and ignorance also.
14:18. Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go
up; the passionate remain in the middle; while
those of the qualities of darkness, adhering to the ways of
the lowest quality, go down.
14:19. When a right-seeing person sees none but the
qualities (to be) the doers (of all action), and knows
what is above the qualities, he enters into my essence.
14:20. The embodied (self), who transcends these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

who is alike in honour and dishonour; who is

Arguna said:
18:1. O you of mighty arms! O Hrishikesa! O destroyer
of Kesin! I wish to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> about
renunciation and abandonment distinctly.
The Deity said:
18:2. By renunciation the sages understand the rejection
of actions done with desires. The wise call the
abandonment of the fruit of all actions (by the name)
abandonment.
18:3. Some wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> say, that action should be
abandoned as being full of evil; and others, that the
actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should not be
abandoned.
18:4. As to that abandonment, O best of the descendants
of Bharata! listen to my decision; for
abandonment, O bravest of men! is described (to be)
threefold.
18:5. The actions of sacrifice, gift, and penance should
not be abandoned; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> needs be performed;
for sacrifices, gifts, and penances are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of
sanctification to the wise.
18:6. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> these actions, O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pritha! should be
performed, abandoning attachment and fruit;
such is my excellent and decided opinion.
18:7. The renunciation of prescribed action is not proper.
Its abandonment through delusion I is
described as of the quality of darkness.
18:8. When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> abandons action, merely as being
troublesome, through fear of bodily affliction, he
68

does not obtain the fruit of abandonment by making
(such) passionate abandonment.
18:9. When prescribed action is performed, O Arguna!
abandoning attachment and fruit also, merely
because it ought to be performed, that is deemed (to be)
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> abandonment.
18:10. He who is possessed of abandonment, being full
of goodness, and talented, and having his doubts
destroyed, is not averse from unpleasant actions, is not
attached to pleasant (ones).
18:11. <span class="t6 hoverable">Since</span> no embodied (being) can abandon actions
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> exception, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be possessed of
abandonment, who abandons the fruit of action.
18:12. The threefold fruit of action, agreeable,
disagreeable, and mixed, accrues after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> to those
who
are not possessed of abandonment, but <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> to
renouncers.
18:13. Learn from me, O you of mighty arms! these five
causes of the completion of all actions, declared
in the Sankhya system.
18:14. The substratum, the agent likewise, the various
sorts of organs, and the various and distinct
movements, and with these the deities, too, as the fifth.
18:15. Whatever action, just or otherwise, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
performs with his body, speech, and mind, these five are
its causes.
18:16. That being so, the undiscerning man, who being
of an unrefined understanding, sees the agent in
the immaculate self, sees not (rightly).
18:17. He who has no feeling of egoism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>

people, kills not, is not fettered (by the action).
18:18. Knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knower
threefold is the prompting to action. The

instrument, the action, the agent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> in brief is action

udgitha; for the udgitha (a portion of the Samaveda) is sung, beginning with Om.
The full account, however, of Om is this:
1-1:2. The essence of all beings is the earth, the essence
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is water, the essence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> the

speech, the essence of speech the Rig-veda, the
essence of the Rig-veda the Sama-veda, the essence of
the Sama-veda the udgitha (which is Om).
1-1:3. That udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the
highest, deserving the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> place, the eighth.
1-1:4. What then is the Rik? What is the Saman? What
is the udgitha? This is the question.
1-1:5. The Rik <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is speech, Saman is breath, the
udgitha is the syllable Om. Now speech and
breath, or Rik and Saman, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> couple.
1-1:6. And that couple is joined <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> in the syllable
Om. When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> together, they fulfil
each other's desire.
1-1:7. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he who knowing this, meditates on the
syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> a fulfiller

of desires.
1-1:8. That syllable is a syllable of permission, for
whenever we permit anything, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> Om, yes. Now
permission is gratification. He who knowing this
meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgitha, becomes
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> a gratifier of desires.
1-1:9. By that syllable does the threefold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> (the

proceeds by the greatness of that syllable (the vital
breaths), and by its essence (the oblations).
1-1:10. Now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> seem to follow, that both

performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad is
more powerful. This is the full <span class="t2 t4 hoverable">account</span> of the syllable Om.
Section 2
Second Khanda
1-2:1. When the Devas and Asuras struggled together,
both of the race of Pragapati, the Devas took the
udgitha (Om), thinking they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> vanquish the Asuras
with it.
1-2:2. They meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the breath
(scent) in the nose, but the Asuras pierced it (the
breath) with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> we smell by the breath in the
nose both what is good-smelling and what is
bad-smelling. For the breath was pierced by evil.
1-2:3. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as
speech, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>
we speak both <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> and falsehood. For speech is
pierced by evil.
77

1-2:4. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
eye, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is
pierced by evil.
1-2:5. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
ear, but the Asuras pierced it with evil. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span>
we hear both what should be heard and what should not
be heard. For the ear is pierced by evil.
1-2:6. Then they meditated on the udgitha (Om) as the
mind, but the Asuras pierced it with evil.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> we conceive both what should be conceived
and what should not be conceived. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> is
pierced by evil.
1-2:7. Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth. They
meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that breath.
When the Asuras <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to it, they were scattered, as (a
ball of earth) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be scattered when hitting a
solid stone.
1-2:8. Thus, as a ball of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is scattered when hitting
on a solid stone, will he be scattered who wishes

is a solid stone.
1-2:9. By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes
<span class="t5 t7 t11 t21 t29 hoverable">neither</span> what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> nor what is bad-smelling, for
that breath is free from evil. What we eat and drink with it
supports the other vital breaths (i.e. the
senses, such as smell, &c.) When at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> he
does not find that breath (in the mouth, through
which he eats and drinks lives), then he departs. He
opens the mouth at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> (as if wishing to
eat).
1-2:10. Angiras meditated on the udgitha (Om) as that
breath, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> hold it to be Angiras, i.e. the
essence of the members (anganam rasah);

as that breath, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> hold it to be
Brihaspati, for speech is brihati, and he (that breath) is

because it comes (ayati) from the mouth (asya);

Udgatri (singer) of the Naimishiya-sacrificers, and
by singing he obtained for them their wishes.
1-2:14. He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable
Om (the imperishable udgitha) as the breath of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the mouth, he obtains all wishes by singing. So

reference to the body.
Section 3
Third Khanda
1-3:1. Now follows the meditation on the udgitha with
reference to the gods. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> meditate on the
udgitha (Om) as he who sends warmth (the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> in the
sky). When the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> rises it sings as Udgatri for the
sake of all creatures. When it rises it destroys the fear of
darkness. He who knows this, is able to destroy
the fear of darkness (ignorance).

1-10:1. When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail)
stones, Ushasti Kakrayana lived as a beggar with
his virgin wife at Ibhyagrama.
1-10:2. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him.
The chief said: `I have no more, except those

1-10:3. Ushasti said: `Give me to eat of them.' He gave
him the beans, and said: `There is something to
drink also.' Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Ushasti: `If I drank of it, I should

1-10:4. The chief said: `Were not those beans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> left

`No,' he replied; `for I should not have lived, if I had not
eaten them, but the drinking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be

1-10:5. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the
remaining beans to his wife. But she, having eaten
before, took them and <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> them away.
1-10:6. Rising the next morning, Ushasti <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to her:

belongs to the prastava (the hymns &c. of the
Prastotri), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'
1-10:10. In the same manner he addressed the Udgatri:
`Udgatri, if you, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing the deity which

Ushasti said: `Very well; but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> those, with my

The sacrificer assented.

Second Khanda
4-2:1. Then Ganasruti Pautrayana took six hundred

Raikva and said:

4-2:3. The other replied: `Fie, necklace and carriage be
thine, O Sudra, <span class="t10 hoverable">together</span> with the cows.'
The Ganasruti Pautrayana took again a thousand cows, a
necklace, a carriage with mules, and his own

4-3:5. Once while Saunaka Kapeya and Abhipratarin
Kakshaseni were being waited on at their meal, a
religious student begged of them. They gave him
nothing.

to the path of the Devas? Householders, who
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> the secret doctrine of the five fires or the five

who have retired to the forest, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> worship

arises, whether religious students <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> enter the path
of the Devas? This is affirmed, because Puranas and
Smritis assert it, or because our text, if properly
understood, does not exclude it. Those, on the contrary
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> not only a conditioned, but the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span>

the Devas, but obtain <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> immediately.
Again, there is <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> difference of opinion whether, after a

shown to be an erroneous view, because, besides

When he became great, then there was the

First Khanda
With the second Aranyaka the Upanishad begins. It
comprises the second and third Aranyakas, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

Their general title is Bahvrika-upanishad,
sometimes Mahaitareya-upanishad, while the Upanishad
generally <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as Aitareya-upanishad
comprises the 4th, 5th, and 6th adhyayas only of the
second Aranyaka.
The character of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> component portions of the
Upanishad can best be described in Sankara's own
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> (Ar. III, 1, 1, Introd.): `There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> classes of

the Ait. Ar. II, 4-6. The middle class are those who wish
to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> free gradually by attaining to the

For them the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and
worship of Prana (breath and life) is intended, as
explained in the Ait. Ar. II, 1-3. The lowest class consists
of those who do not care either for immediate
or gradual freedom, but who desire <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but offspring,
cattle, &c. For these the meditative worship of
the Samhita is intended, as explained in the third
Aranyaka. They cling too strongly to the letter of the
sacred <span class="t1 t2 t6 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> to be able to surrender it for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
either of Prana (life) or of Brahman.'
The connexion between the Upanishad or rather the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>

On this point too there are some pertinent remarks in
Sankara's commentary on the Aranyaka II, 1, 2.
`Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> duty,' he says, `consists in performing sacrifices,
such as are described in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> portion of the

the performance of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> upasanas or
meditations is enjoined, such as we find described in our
Upanishad, viz. in Ar. II, 1-3.'
This meditation or, as it is sometimes translated, worship
is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, either brahmopasana or

<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> qualities. Pratikopasana or meditation on symbols
consists in looking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> worldly objects

These objects, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lifted up into symbols of Brahman,

class only, viz. with <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> portions of the
Mahavrata, as described in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> Aranyaka. In <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span>

2, 3-3:4. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, downbreathing, back-breathing, out-breathing, onbreathing. The other powers (devatas), viz. sight,
hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under upbreathing and down-breathing. For when breath departs,

With regard to its being performed as a Saman

Ragana. With regard to metre, it is Gayatri,
Ushnih, Brihati, Trishtubh, and Dvipada. And the

recognise a thousand of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> metres (not of

2, 3-6:1. This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a
thousand of Brihati verses. In this thousand of
Brihatis there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hundred and twentyfive Anushtubhs.

2, 3-6:2. This has been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> by a Rishi (Rv. VIII, 76, 12):
2, 3-6:3. `A speech of eight feet;' because there are
eight feet of four syllables each in the Anushtubh.
2, 3-6:4. `Of nine corners;' because the Brihati becomes
nine-cornered (having nine feet of four
syllables each).
2, 3-6:5. `Touching the truth;' because speech
(Anushtubh) is truth, touched by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> (Brihati).
2, 3-6:6. `He (the Hotri) makes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> out of Indra;'
for out of this thousand of Brihati verses turned

2, 3-6:7. This Mahaduktha is the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> development of
speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not
measured, music, true, and untrue.
2, 3-6:8. A Rik verse, a gatha, a kumbya are measured
(metrical). A Yagus line, an invocation, and
general remarks, these are not measured (they are in
prose). A Saman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is
music. Om is true, Na is untrue.
2, 3-6:9. What is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> (Om) is the flower and fruit of
speech. He is able to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> celebrated and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

With this adhyaya begins the real Upanishad, best <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>
under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the Aitareya-upanishad, and
often separately edited, commented on, and translated. If
treated separately, what we call the fourth
adhyaya of the second Aranyaka, becomes the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
adhyaya of the Upanishad, sometimes also, by counting
all adhyayas from the beginning of the Aitareya-aranyaka,
the ninth. The divisions adopted by Sayana,
who explains the Upanishad as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Aranyaka, and
by Sankara, who explains it independently,
vary, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> Sayana states that he follows in his
commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of
Sankara. I have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> the divisions adopted by Sayana,
and have marked those of Sankara's by figures in
parentheses, placed at the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of each paragraph. The
difference between this Upanishad and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span>
preceding adhyayas is easily perceived. Hitherto the
answer to the question, Whence this world? had
been, From Prana, prana <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> breath and life, which
was looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> as a sufficient
explanation of all that is. From a psychological point of
view this prana is the conscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span>
(pragnatman); in a more mythological <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> it appears as
Hiranyagarbha, `the golden germ,' sometimes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as Indra.

pranavidya, or life-knowledge, to show that the living
principle in us is the same as the living principle in the
sun, and that by a recognition of their identity and
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of prana, the devotee, or he who has

This is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> expressed in the Kaushitaki-upanishad III, 2,
where Indra <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> to Pratardana: `I am Prana;
meditate on me as the conscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> (pragnatman), as

Immortality is prana, prana is immortality. By prana he
obtains immortality in the other world, by

This, however, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have satisfied the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of

That final solution of the problem not simply of life, but of
existence, is <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> in the Upanishad which
teaches that Atman, the Self, and not Prana, Life, is the
last and only <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> of everything. In some places
this doctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self,
it is said, has its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> being in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span>

<span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> of this Upanishad, this simple doctrine is
mixed up with <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> that is mythological, fanciful, and
absurd, arthavada, as the commentators call it, but
as it <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> often be more truly called, anarthavada, and it
is only towards the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> that the identity of the

it is heaven, the support. The Marikis (the

He led a cow towards them (the deities). They said: `This

They said: `This is not enough.' (2)

He tried to grasp it by the mind. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not grasp it by

He tried to grasp it by the down-breathing (the breath
which helps to swallow food through the mouth and
to carry it off through the rectum, the payvindriya). He got
it.
2, 4-3:3. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is Vayu (the getter) who lays hold of

Sixth Khanda
3, 1-6:1. Tarukshya said: `The Samhita (union) is formed
by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of the Brihat and Rathantara Samans.'
3, 1-6:2. Verily, the Rathantara Saman is speech, the
Brihat Saman is breath. By both, by speech and
breath, the Samhita is formed.
3, 1-6:3. For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his
teacher the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this Samhita of speech and

3, 1-6:4. For it alone Tarukshya guards the cows a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span>

3, 1-6:5. This has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> been declared by a Rishi (Rv. X,

3, 1-6:6. `Vasishtha carried hither the Rathantara;
`Bharadvaga <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> hither the Brihat of Agni.'
3, 1-6:7. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),

3, 1-6:9. He who knows this gradual Samhita (union),
becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory
of countenance, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of Svarga, in exactly the
same manner as this Samhita, i.e. gradually.
3, 1-6:10. If that worshipper, whether for his own sake or
for that of another, recites (the Samhita), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span>

3, 1-6:11. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows this Samhita (union),

age.
3, 1-6:12. Pankalakanda said: `The Samhita (union,
composition) is speech.'
3, 1-6:13. Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the
metres are composed. Friends unite through
speech, all beings unite through speech; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span>
speech is everything here.
3, 1-6:14. With regard to this (view of speech being more
than breath), it should be borne in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> that

(absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And
when we are silent or sleep, speech is (absorbed) in
breath; breath swallows speech. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> swallow

3, 1-6:15. This has been declared <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> by a Rishi (Rv. X,
114, 4):

age.
3, 1-6:18. Next follows the Pragapati-Samhita.
3, 1-6:19. The former half is the wife, the latter half the
man; the result of their union the son; the act of
their union the begetting; that Samhita is Aditi
(indestructible).
3, 1-6:20. For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever
there is, father, mother, son, and begetting.

The mute consonants represent <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire), the sibilants

The mute consonants represent the Rig-veda, the

The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the

The mute consonants represent the up-breathing, the
sibilants the down-breathing, the vowels the backbreathing.
3, 2-5:3. Next comes this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">divine</span> lute (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> body,

there is a tongue of this, so there is a tongue in

so that is covered with a hairy skin.
3, 2-5:5. Verily, in former times they covered a lute with a
hairy skin.
3, 2-5:6. He who knows this lute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by the Devas (and

3, 2-6:6. Hrasva Mandukeya said: `If we here recite the

said: `Why should we repeat (the Veda), why

should we sacrifice? We offer as a sacrifice breath in

2, 3-4:2. Note: All these are technicalities connected with
the singing and reciting of the uktha. The
commentator says: The stoma is a collection of single

Sayana in his commentary on the Ait. Ar. takes the Trivrit

R., s. v. trivrit, state that this stoma consists of verses 1,

11, but, accoording to Sayana, the stoma consists (1) of

Tandya Br. II, 4. Taking the Sukta agna a yahi

stoma to consist of (1) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 1 x 3, 2, 3; (2) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">verse</span> 1,

The five Samans are explained by the commentator. The
Gayatra is formed out of the Rik (III, 62, 10) tat
savitur varenyam. The Rathantara is formed out of the
Rik (VII, 32, 22) abhi tva sura nonuma. The
Brihat is formed out of the Rik (VI, 46, 1) tvam id dhi
havamahe. The Bhadra is formed out of the Rik
(X, 157, 1) ima nu kam. The Ragana is formed out of the
Rik (VII, 27, 1) indram naro nemadhita.
The metres require no explanation.

Sankara, in his colamentary on the Vedanta-sutras III, 4,
7; 13; 14, takes the same view of this passage.
The opponent of Badarayana, in this case, Gaimini
himself; maintains that karma, work, is indispensable
to knowledge, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> other arguments, he says, III,
4, 7, that it is so `Niyamat,' `Because it is so laid

The verses 9-14 are again full of difficulty, not so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in
themselves as in relation to the general system
of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> which prevails in the Upanishads, and forms
the foundation of the Vedanta philosophy. The
commentators vary considerably in their interpretations.
Sankara explains avidya, not-knowledge, by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, particularly sacrifice, performed with a hope
of reward; vidya, or knowledge, by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of the gods, but not, as yet, of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> Brahman. The
former is generally supposed to lead the
sacrificer to the pitriloka, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the fathers, from
whence he returns to a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> series of births; the

arises, how in our passage the former <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to
lead to blind darkness, the latter to still greater darkness.
But for that statement, I have no doubt that all
300

the commentators would, as usual, have taken vidya for
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman, and
avidya for orthodox belief in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> works, the
former securing in immortality in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of
freedom from <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> births, while the reward of the latter is
blessedness in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> for a limited period, but

firmly established that I <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> myself to

Mahidhara thinks that these verses refer to the

Buddhist in a very general sense. Uvata puts the
Lokayatas in their place. It is curious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> to observe
that Mahidhara, following Uvata, explains asambhuti at

while he takes sambhuti rightly for Brahman. I have
chiely followed Uvata's commentary, except in his

follows Uvata explains sambhuti rightly by the only
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> fo the origin of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> world, i.e. Brahman, while

Sankara sees <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more in these verses than Uvata. He
takes asambhuti as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Prakriti, the

worship of the developed, i.e. of Hiranyagarbha,
immortality, absorption in Prakriti.'
All these forced explanations to which the commentators
have recourse, arise from the shifting views held
by various authorities with regard to the value of works.
Our Upanishad seems to me to propound the
doctrine that works, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> in themselves useless, or

the asramas, or stages of student and householder, before he was admitted to the freedom of a

broken the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> law, and in some respects they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

nearly the same explanation as before; only that he
makes aganadevah still clearer, by explaining them as

Then he moved about, worshipping. From him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

`Verily, there appeared to me, while I worshipped
(arkate), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> (ka).' This is why <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> ar-ka.

1-2:2. Verily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">water</span> is arka. And what was there as the
froth of the water, that was hardened, and became
the earth. On that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> he (Death) rested, and from him,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> resting and heated, <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> (Virag)
proceeded, full of light.
1-2:3. That being divided itself threefold, Aditya (the sun)
as the third, and Vayu (the air) as the third.
That <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (prana) became threefold. The head was the
Eastern quarter, and the arms this and that
quarter (i.e. the N.E. and S.E., on the left and <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> sides).
Then the tail was the Western quarter, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> legs this and that quarter (i.e. the N.W. and S.W.).
The sides were the Southern and Northern
quarters, the back heaven, the belly the sky, the dust the
earth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he (Mrityu, as arka) stands firm in
the water, and he who knows this stands firm wherever
he goes.
1-2:4. He desired, `Let a second <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> be born of me,'
and he (Death or Hunger) embraced Speech in his
mind. Then the seed became the year. Before that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
there was no year. Speech bore him so <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as a
year, and after that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> sent him forth. Then when he
was born, he (Death) opened his mouth, as if to
swallow him. He cried Bhan! and that became speech.

1-2:5. He thought, `If I kill him, I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> have but little food.'

the Yagus, the Saman, the metres, the sacrifices,
men, and animals.
And whatever he (Death) <span class="t14 t15 t17 t21 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> forth, that he resolved
to eat (ad). Verily because he eats everything,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> is Aditi (Death) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Aditi. He who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> knows

everything, and everything becomes his food.
1-2:6. He desired to sacrifice again with a greater
sacrifice. He toiled and performed penance. And while
he toiled and performed penance, glorious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t5 t8 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span>
out of him. Verily glorious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the
senses (prana). Then when the senses had gone out, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> took to swelling (sva-yitum), and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> was
in the body.
1-2:7. He desired that this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> should be fit for sacrifice
(medhya), and that he should be embodied by it.
Then he became a horse (asva), because it swelled
(asvat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is
why the horse-sacrifice is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Asva-medha.
Verily he who knows him thus, knows the Asvamedha.
Then, letting the horse free, he thought, and at
the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of a year he offered it up for himself, while he
gave up the (other) animals to the deities.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the sacrificers offered up the purified horse
belonging to Pragapati, (as dedicated) to all the

Verily the shining <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> is the Asvamedha-sacrifice, and his

the Devas and the Asuras. Now the Devas were

Devas, who were struggling in these worlds, said:
`Well, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices (the

1-3:23. He (breath) is Udgitha. Breath verily is Ut, for by
breath this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and
speech is Githa, song. And because he is ut and githa,

1-3:25. He who knows what is the property of this
Saman, obtains property. Now verily its property is
tone only. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> a priest, who is going to perform

1-3:26. He who knows what is the gold of that Saman,

1-3:27. He who knows what is the support of that Saman,

Next follows the Abhyaroha (the ascension) of the
Pavamana verses. Verily the Prastotri begins to sing the
Saman, and when he begins, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him (the sacrificer)

`one of his (foods) was common,' then that is that
common food of his which is eaten. He who worships

evil, for verily that food is mixed (property). When it is

the huta, which is sacrificed in fire, and the prahuta, which

Vaideha. He asked him: `Are you <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> the wisest
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> us, O Yagnavalkya?' He replied: `I bow before the
wisest (the best knower of Brahman), but I wish
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> to have these cows.'
Then Asvala, the Hotri priest, undertook to question him.
3-1:3. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here
(connected with the sacrifice) is reached by death,
everything is overcome by death. By what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> then is
the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of death?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Hotri priest, who is <span class="t1 t2 t5 t9 t19 hoverable">Agni</span> (fire),
who is speech. For speech is the Hotri of the
sacrifice (or the sacrificer), and speech is Agni, and he is
the Hotri. This constitutes freedom, and perfect
freedom (from death).'
3-1:4. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night, everything is overcome by

beyond the reach of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Adhvaryu priest, who is the
eye, who is Aditya (the sun). For the eye is the
Adhvaryu of the sacrifice, and the eye is the sun, and he
is the Adhvaryu. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.'
3-1:5. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `everything here is
reached by the waxing and waning of the moon,
everything is overcome by the waxing and waning of the
moon. By what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> then is the sacrificer
freed beyond the reach of the waxing and waning of the
moon?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the Udgatri priest, who is Vayu
(the wind), who is the breath. For the breath is the
Udgatri of the sacrifice, and the breath is the wind, and he
is the Udgatri. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom.'

3-1:6. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `this sky is, as it were,

does the sacrificer approach the Svarga world?'
Yagnavalkya said: `By the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> priest, who is the

Next follow the achievements.

`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.

`What does he gain by them?'
`All whatsoever has breath.'

`Three,' replied Yagnavalkya.

`Those which, when offered, flame up; those which, when

`The Puronuvakya is Prana (up-breathing), the Yagya the

`He gains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> by the Puronuvakya, the sky by the

3-3:1. Then Bhugyu Lahyayani asked. `Yagnavalkya,' he
said, `we wandered about as students, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>

who was possessed by a Gandharva. We asked him,
`Who <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> thou?' and he (the Gandharva) replied: `I am
Sudhanvan, the Angirasa.' And when we asked

He said: `And where do they go who have performed a

Yagnavalkya replied: `Thirty-two journeys of the car of the

between them a space as large as the edge of a razor or

and Vayu (the air), holding them <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> himself,
conveyed them to where they dwell who have performed

unheard, but hearing; unperceived, but

He asked: `Who are those thirty-three?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The eight Vasus, the eleven

3-9:3. He asked: `Who are the Vasus.'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Agni (fire), Prithivi (earth), Vayu

(heaven), Kandramas (moon), the Nakshatras (stars),

3-9:5. He asked: `Who are the Adityas?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The twelve months of the year, and
they are Adityas, because they move along

move along, taking up everything, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they

3-9:6. He asked: `And who is Indra, and who is
Pragapati?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Indra is thunder, Pragapati is the
sacrifice.'
He asked: `And what is the thunder?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The thunderbolt.'
He asked: `And what is the sacrifice?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The (sacrificial) animals.'
3-9:7. He asked: `Who are the six?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `Agni (fire), Prithivi (earth), Vayu
(air), Antariksha (sky), Aditya (sun), Dyu
(heaven), they are the six, for they are all this, the six.'
3-9:8. He asked: `Who are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gods?'

Yagnavalkya replied: `He that blows.'

But those Brahmanas durst not (say anything).
3-9:28. Then Yagnavalkya questioned them with these
Slokas:
1. `As a mighty tree in the forest, so in <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is man, his
hairs are the leaves, his outer skin is the bark.
407

2. `From his skin flows <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> blood, sap from the skin (of

3. `The lumps of his flesh are (in the tree) the layers of
wood, the fibre is strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the tendons. The

4. `But, while the tree, when felled, grows up again more
young from the root, from what root, tell me,
does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?
5. `Do not say, "from seed," for seed is produced from
the living; but a tree, springing from a grain,
clearly rises again after death.
6. `If a tree is pulled up with the root, it will not grow
again; from what root then, tell me, does a mortal
grow up, after he has been felled by death?
7. `Once born, he is not born (again); for who should
create him again?'
`Brahman, who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and bliss, he is the

said: `I bow to you, O Yagnavalkya, teach me.'
Yagnavalkya said: `Your Majesty, as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who wishes

by these Upanishads. You are honourable, and
wealthy, you have learnt the Vedas and been told the
Upanishads. Whither then will you go when
departing hence?'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Sir, I do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> whither I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>
go.'

Yagnavalkya said: `Then I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell you this, whither you
will go.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `Tell it, Sir.'
4-2:2. Yagnavalkya said: `That person who is in the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span>
eye, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Indha, and him who is Indha
they call <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> Indra mysteriously, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span>
what is mysterious, and dislike what is evident.
4-2:3. `Now that which in the shape of a person is in the
<span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> eye, is his wife, Virag. Their meetingplace is the ether <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the heart, and their food the red
lump <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the heart. Again, their covering is
that which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> net-work <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the heart, and the road
on which they move (from sleep to waking) is
the artery that rises upwards from the heart. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> a hair
divided into a thousand parts, so are the veins of
it, which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hita, placed firmly <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the heart.
Through these <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> that (food) flows on
flowing, and he (the Taigasa) receives as it were purer
food than the corporeal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> (the Vaisvanara).
4-2:4. `His (the Taigasa's) Eastern quarter are the pranas
(breath) which go to the East;
`His Southern quarter are the pranas which go to the
South;
`His Western quarter are the pranas which go to the
West;
`His Northern quarter are the pranas which go to the
North;
`His Upper (Zenith) quarter are the pranas which go
upward;
`His Lower (Nadir) quarter are the pranas which go
downward;
`All the quarters are all the pranas. And he (the Atman in
that state) can only be described by No, no! He
is incomprehensible, for he <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be comprehended; he
is undecaying, for he <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> decay; he is not
415

attached, for he does not attach himself; he is unbound,
he does not suffer, he does not perish. O Ganaka,
you have <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> reached fearlessness,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
Yagnavalkya.
Then Ganaka said: `May that fearlessness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to you

Here are the Videhas, and here am I (thy slave).'
Section 3
Third Brahmana
4-3:1. Yagnavalkya <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to Ganaka Vaideha, and he did
not mean to speak with him. But when
formerly Ganaka Vaideha and Yagnavalkya had a
disputation on the Agnihotra, Yagnavalkya had granted
him a boon, and he chose (for a boon) that he <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be
free to ask him any question he liked.
Yagnavalkya granted it, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to
ask him a question.
4-3:2. `Yagnavalkya,' he said, `what is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The sun, O King; for, having the
<span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> alone for his light, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> sits, moves about,
does his work, and returns.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:3. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has set, O
Yagnavalkya, what is then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of man?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `The moon <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is his light; for,
having the moon alone for his light, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> sits,
moves about, does his work, and returns.'
Ganaka Vaideha said: `So <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:4. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, what is the

Yagnavalkya replied: `Fire <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is his light; for, having

4-3:5. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> is

Yagnavalkya replied: `Sound <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is his light; for,

Ganaka Vaideha said: `So <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> it is, O Yagnavalkya.'
4-3:6. Ganaka Vaideha said: `When the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> has set, O
Yagnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> is
gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of

Yagnavalkya said: `The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is his light; for, having

about, does his work, and returns.'
4-3:7. Ganaka Vaideha said: `Who is that Self?'
Yagnavalkya replied: `He who is <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the heart,
surrounded by the Pranas (senses), the person of light,
consisting of knowledge. He, remaining the same,
wanders along the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> worlds, as if thinking, as if
moving. During sleep (in dream) he transcends this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

the sway of death, all that is perishable).
4-3:8. `On being born that person, assuming his body,
becomes united with all evils; when he departs and
dies, he leaves all evils behind.
4-3:9. `And there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> states for that person, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
here in this world, the other in the other world,
and as a third an intermediate state, the state of sleep.
When in that intermediate state, he sees both those
states together, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> here in this world, and the other

he sees both the evils and the blessings.

`And when he falls asleep, then after having taken <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span>
with him the material from the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> world,
destroying and building it up again, he sleeps (dreams) by
his own light. In that state the person is selfilluminated.
4-3:10. `There are no (real) chariots in that state, no
horses, no roads, but he himself sends <span class="t1 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">forth</span> (creates)

4-3:11. `On this there are these verses:
`After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the
body, he, not asleep himself, looks down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

Uktha, for breath raises up (utthapayati) all
this. From him who knows this, there is raised a wise
son, knowing the Uktha; he obtains union and
oneness with the Uktha.
5-13:2. Next follows the Yagus. Verily, breath is Yagus,
for all these beings are joined in breath. For
him who knows this, all beings are joined to procure his
excellence; he obtains union and oneness with
the Yagus.
5-13:3. Next follows the Saman. Verily, breath is the
Saman, for all these beings meet in breath. For
him who knows this, all beings meet to procure his
excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the
Saman.
5-13:4. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the
Kshatra, for breath is Kshatra, i.e. breath protects
(trayate) him from being hurt (kshanitoh). He who knows
this, obtains Kshatra (power), which requires
no protection; he obtains union and oneness with
Kshatra.

five kinds of perceptions. It has five whirlpools, its rapids
are the five pains; it has fifty kinds of suffering,
and five branches.
1:6. In that vast Brahma-wheel, in which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> live

god, the lord). When he has been blessed by
him, then he gains immortality.
1:7. But what is praised (in the Upanishads) is the
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman, and in it there is the triad. The
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> is the safe support, it is imperishable.
The Brahma-students, when they have <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span>
what is <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> this (world), are devoted and merged in the
Brahman, free from birth.
1:8. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> (isa) supports all this together, the
perishable and the imperishable, the developed and the
undeveloped. The (living) self, not being a lord, is bound,
because he has to enjoy (the fruits of works);
but when he has <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> (deva), he is freed from
all fetters.

there is the infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> (appearing) under all forms, but

three, that is Brahma.
1:10. That which is perishable is the Pradhana (the first),
the immortal and imperishable is Hara. The

(living) self. From meditating on him, from joining
him, from becoming <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> with him there is further
cessation of all illusion in the end.

sufferings are destroyed, and birth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> cease.
From meditating on him there arises, on the dissolution of
the body, the third state, that of universal
lordship; but he only who is alone, is satisfied.
1:12. This, which rests eternally <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the self, should be
known; and beyond this not anything has to be
known. By knowing the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and the
ruler, everything has been declared to be threefold,
and this is Brahman.
1:13. As the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of fire, while it exists in the under-wood,

Commentary
6:4. Note: These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> verses are again extremely
obscure, and the explanations of the commentators throw
little <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> on the their real, original meaning. To begin
with Sankara, he assumes the subject to be the
same as he at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> command this <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> unfolds itself,
and explains tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam by
atmano bhumyadina yogam samgamayya. As the eight
Tattvas he gives earth, water, fire, air, ether,
mind, thought, personality, while the Atmagunas are,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to him, the affections of the mind, love,
anger, &c. In the second verse, however, Sankara
seems to assume a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> subject. `If a man,' he says,
`having done works, infected by qualities, should transfer
them on Isvara, the Lord, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
destruction of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> formerly done by him, because
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no more connection with the self.'
Something is left out, but that this is Sankara's idea,
appears from the verses which he quotes in support,
and which are intended to show that Yogins, transfering
all their acts, good, bad, or indifferent, on
Brahman, are no longer affected by them. `That person,'
Sankara continues, `his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> being destroyed
and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> purified, moves on, <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
(tattva), from all the results of ignorance,
knowing himself to be Brahman.' `Or,' he adds, `if we
read anyad, it means, he goes to that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span>
which is differen from all things.'
Sankarananda takes a <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> view. He says: `If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
has performed sacrifices, and has finished them,
or, has turned <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from them again as vain, and if he
has obtained union with that which is the real of
the (apparently) real, &c.' The commentator then asks
what is that with which he obtains union, and
replies, `the one, i.e. ignorance; the two, i.e. <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> and
wrong; the three, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> colours, red white,
and black; and the eight, i.e. the five elements, with mind,
thought, and personality; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> with time, and
with the subtile affections of the mind.' He then goes on,
`If that man, after having begun qualified
475

works, should <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> on himself all states (resulting from
ignorance), yet, when these states cease, there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the work, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> or bad, done by him,
and when his <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to an end, he abides
in <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> (according to the Veda); while the other, who
differs from the Veda, is wrong.' Sankarananda,
however, evidently feels that this is a doubtful
interpretation, and he suggests another, viz. `If the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span>

He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> says, that when these states, ignorance &c.,
cease, the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ceases; and when
the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done ceases, the living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> gets free of
samsara, being in <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> another, i.e. <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from
ignorance and its products.'
Vignanatman says: `If a man, having done work, turns
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> from it, and obtains union of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> tattva (the
tvam, or self) with the real tatta (the tat, or the Lord); and
how? By <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of the one, i.e. the teaching
of the Guru; the two, i.e. <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> of the Guru and of the Lord;
the three, i.e. hearing remembering, and
meditating; the eight, i.e. restraint, penance, postures,
regulation of the breath, abstraction, devotion,
contemplation, and meditation (Yoga-sutras II, 29); by
time, i.e. the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> for work; by the qualities
of the self, i.e. pity, &c.; by the subtile ones, i.e. the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
dispositions for knowledge, then (we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
supply) he becomes free.' And this he explains more fully
in the next verse. `If, after having done
qualified works, i.e. <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> to please the Lord, a Yati
discards all things, and recognises the phenomenal
character of all states, and traces them back to their real
source, the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> done ceases <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in its effects,
and when the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> has been annihilated, he goes to
freedom, being <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> in truth; or, if we read anyat,
he goes to what is <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> from all these things, namely,
to the Lord; or, he goes to a state of perfect
lordship in truth, having discovered the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> truth, the
oneness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">self</span> with the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> Self.'
I think that, judging from the context, the subject is really
the same in both verses, viz. the Lord, as
passing through <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> states, and at last knowing
himself to be above them all. Yet, the other

taken to be <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in each verse, some difficulties

Adoration to the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> Self! Harih, Om!
1:1. Sukesas Bharadvaga, and Saivya Satyakama, and
Sauryayanin Gargya, and Kausalya Asvalayana,
and Bhargava Vaidarbhi, and Kabandhin Katyayana,
these were devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman,
seeking for the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">Highest</span> Brahman. They <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that the
venerable Pippalada <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> tell them all that, and

approached him.
1:2. That Rishi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: `Stay here a year longer,

1:3. Then Kabandhin Katyayana approached him and
asked: `Sir, from whence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> these creatures be

1:4. He replied: `Pragapati (the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of creatures) was
desirous of creatures (pragah). He performed
penance, and having performed penance, he produces a
pair, matter (rayi) and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> (prana), thinking that

1:6. Now Aditya, the sun, when he rises, goes toward the
East, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> receives the Eastern spirits into

1:9. The year <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> is Pragapati, and there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

those who here believe in sacrifices and pious gifts as

abstinence, faith, and knowledge, gain by the

Second Question
2:1. Then Bhargava Vaidarbhi asked him: `Sir, How

2:2. He replied: `The ether is that god, the wind, fire,
water, earth, speech, mind, eye, and ear. These,
when they have manifested (their power), contend and
say: We (each of us) support this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and keep it.
2:3. Then Prana (breath, spirit, life), as the best, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to

2:4. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if
he were going out from above. Thereupon, as he

the <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> returned. As bees go out when their

speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied,
they praise Prana, saying:

Parganya (rain), the powerful (Indra), he is Vayu

Fourth Question
4:1. Then Sauryayanin Gargya asked: `Sir, What are
they that sleep in this man, and what are they that
are awake in him? What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> (deva) is it that sees

these depend?'
4:2. He replied: `O Gargya, As all the rays of the sun,
when it sets, are gathered up in that disc of light,
and as they, when the <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">sun</span> rises again and again, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>
forth, so is all this (all the senses) gathered up in
the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> faculty (deva), the mind. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> at that

4:3. The fires of the pranas are, as it were, awake in that
town (the body). The Apana is the Garhapatya
fire, the Vyana the Anvaharyapakana fire; and because it
is taken out of the Garhapatya fire, which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>

what has been seen and not seen, heard and not heard,
enjoyed and not enjoyed, he sees it all; he, being
all, sees.
4:6. And when he is overpowered by light, then that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span>

There is something else to be known. There is a further
modification of this Self-sacrifice (the eating),
namely, the food and the eater thereof. This is the
explanation. The thinking Purusha (person), when he
abides <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the Pradhana (nature), is the feeder who
feeds on the food supplied by Prakriti (nature).
The elemental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> is truly his food, his maker being

<span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> is the feeder. And for this the evidence is
