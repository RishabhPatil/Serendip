Dueling Demonstrations at LAX Over Trump Travel Restriction - Breitbart
"Opponents as well as proponents of President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting travel from seven Middle Eastern countries assembled to protest at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday. [Leftist   gathered late Saturday morning in front of LAX airport’s Tom Bradley International Terminal while proponents of the   travel restriction gathered just an hour later across the road. The Los Angeles Times reported that those against the restriction numbered around 100 and were led by women in headscarves.  A federal judge in Seattle ruled on Friday for a temporary restraining order regarding major components of the President’s temporary travel restriction executive order. That didn’t stop the protesters from demonstrating at LAX after days of protests at airports of varying sizes across the country. “Trump  —   Hands Off Jerusalem” read one of several yellow signs seen among those protesting against the travel restriction. KNX 1070 radio news reporter Cooper Rummell posted photos of the protest to Twitter: Division at #LAX as protests erupt on both sides of the #TravelBan issue. @KNX1070 pic. twitter.   —   Cooper Rummell (@KNXCooper) February 4
