Ann Coulter Stunning New Development!!! Media Calls Trump Racist - Breitbart
"Annoyed at federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel’s persistent rulings against him in the Trump University case (brought by a law firm that has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches by Bill and Hillary) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that maybe it’s because the judge is a   Mexican immigrant. [The entire media  —   and most of the GOP  —   have spent 10 months telling us that Mexicans in the United States are going to HATE Trump for saying he’ll build a wall. Now they’re outraged that Trump thinks one Mexican hates him for saying he’ll build a wall.  Curiel has distributed scholarships to illegal aliens. He belongs to an organization that sends lawyers to the border to ensure that no illegal aliens’ “human rights” are violated. The name of the organization? The San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association  —   “La Raza” meaning THE RACE. Let’s pause to imagine the nomination hearings for a white male who belonged to any organization for white people  —   much less one with the words “THE RACE” in its title. The media were going to call Trump a racist whatever he did
