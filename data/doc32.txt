INTRODUCTION

"WHEN the religion formerly received is rent by discords," remarks Bacon in his subtle essay on the "Vicissitudes of Things," "and when the holiness of the professors of religion is decayed and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of scandal, and withal the times be stupid, ignorant, and barbarous, you may doubt the springing up of a new sect; if then also there should arise any extravagant and strange <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> to make himself author thereof. If a new sect have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> properties, <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> it not, for it will not spread: the one is the supplanting, or the opposing of authority established--for nothing is more popular than that; the other is the giving licence to pleasures and a voluptuous life: for as for speculative heresies (such as were in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> times the Arians, and now the Arminians), <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> mightily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> men's wits, they do not produce any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> alteration in States, except it be by the help of civil

occasions. There be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> manners of plantations of new sects: by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of signs and miracles; by the eloquence and <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of speech and persuasion; and by the sword. For martyrdoms, I reckon them amongst miracles, because they seem to exceed the strength of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature; and I may do the like of superlative and admirable holiness of life."

So far as his range of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> extended, Bacon's remarks are true. But when we attempt to apply them to the history of Buddhism, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that they need considerable qualification. Buddhism arose in an age when "the holiness of the professors of religion," the influence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Brahman</span> hierarchy in India, was "decayed and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of scandal." But the times, far from being "stupid, ignorant, and barbarous," were <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of eager intellectual and moral activity; on all sides <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> doctrines were being reaffirmed by their professors and assailed by critics, while new systems of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> were rising everywhere. The Buddha. himself was not an "extravagant and strange spirit," but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in essentials was thoroughly in harmony with the ideas of Hinduism, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> character fulfilled a Hindu ideal. His Church did indeed endeavour to supplant the authority of the Brahmans; but it sought to attain this end neither by "the giving licence to pleasures and a voluptuous life," nor by the sword. Its marvellous success was clue to

[p. 9]

[paragraph continues] "the eloquence and <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of speech and persuasion" and to "the superlative and admirable holiness of life" of the Buddha.

About a hundred miles north from Benares, on the border of Nepal, where the plain of the Ganges begins to rise to the uplands at the edge of the mighty Himalayas, lies a little region which was once the home of the S'akyas, a class of Kshatriyas, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of the warrior caste. To Suddhodana of Kapila-vastu, a nobleman of the Gautama family of this tribe, was <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> about 660 B.C. a. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> Siddhartha. When he grew up Siddhartha likewise married and begot a son, Rahula, by name. And then, when he was about twenty-nine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of age, as tradition relates, Siddhartha became weary of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the flesh. The ghastly riddle of Life--Life with its endless vicissitudes of phantom pleasure and ever-renewed pain--was ceaselessly pressing itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, as it has pressed itself <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> so many thousands of other Hindus, and he could <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> no rest in his father's home. So he <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> the world, to become a wandering beggar-student, in the hope of finding the key to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> mystery in the teachings of some <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> of philosophic lore. But none of the teachers whom he met could satisfy the hunger of his soul, and the severest mortification of the <span class="t6 t20 hoverable">flesh</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> him no light.

One day, as he sat meditating in the shadow of a fig-tree, his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> searchings of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> came to

an end, and the answer to the mystery of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> was revealed to him. Henceforth he was the Buddha, the Enlightened Seer, who had won the perfect peace of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> knowledge, the Nirvana [*1]; and the remaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of his <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> were passed in imparting his teaching for the salvation of his fellow-creatures, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> founding the Buddhist Church, until about 482 B.C., <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> and honour, he departed to the supreme Nirvana.

When we examine the doctrines which appear to have been taught by the Buddha, [*2] we see that they are founded <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> conceptions that are characteristic of Hindu thought: the pessimistic <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Karma, and the Samsara, "works" and "wandering." According to the usual Indian creed, the Universe is tenanted by a countless <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of souls in various degrees of elevation; and each of them must <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through an endless <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of births and deaths in the most various kinds of bodies. Every moment of experience that each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> undergoes in each incarnation is the direct result of an act performed in a former birth or later, and in its turn bears fruit in a future experience, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> forming a series of sorrows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> beginning and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

For life, however pleasant it may seem, is in reality but a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> illusive agony, from which only the few escape who by their perfect <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> insight win to identity with the transcendental Being, Brahma.

Now the Buddha, according to the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> tradition of the Pali Canon, dissented from this teaching on one very important point.

[p. 13]

which means "origination in a causal series." The members of this series are as follows

Conformations (Sanskrit, samskaras; Pali, samkhara).

There are very few dogmas in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> history of philosophy and religion that have been so copiously discussed and so differently interpreted as this. It seems to be an attempt to show how <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> existences and consciousnesses arise in the cosmic process. According to Buddhist teaching, there is no permanent "soul" and there is no real "matter." There exists only an infinite <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of series of consciousnesses either potentially or actively in operation, and each series consists of a succession of moments of

[p. 14]

consciousness, each moment being the direct resultant of its predecessors. Now the force which directs this process in each series is its karma, or "works," the influence of former activities, mostly in previous births; it is by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of its former karma that a train of <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> at a particular moment begins to develop itself into an "individual," that is to say, a <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of being a particular person, human, divine, or animal. So we may interpret the Buddha's formula as a vague expression for the manner in which the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> emerges from the ocean of cosmic being. First in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> is "ignorance"; that is to say, when we analyse the operation of karma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a train of moments of consciousness, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that its primary effect is to cause ignorance, namely, the false belief held by this <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> that it is a "self," an ego, and the other consequent delusions. This ignorance, in turn, issues in "conformations," the potentialities of love, hatred, and the like weaknesses of the spirit, which are the resultants of activities in previous individuated existences, and inspire to future activities. Then emerges <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of finite being in general, and from this issue "name and form," the conception of a definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of particulars. This leads to the evolution of the sense-organs, and the union of these with the apparent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> outside them produces sensation, which issues in desire. In its turn <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> leads to

[p. 15]

[paragraph continues] "attraction," the attachment to <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> life. So finite existence, bhava, is at last reached, and the developed <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> passes through the stages of birth, disease, sorrow, and finally death. Then the process begins anew under the guidance of the old karma, reinforced by that which has resulted from the process that has just come to an end. If this interpretation be right (and. it must be confessed that several others are equally plausible), it is evident that the formula is by no means satisfactory on all points; the causal connection between several of the members in the series in the Pratitya-samutpada is far from being clear, and can only he regarded as a dogma--past hoc, ergo propter hoc.

An individual, according to Buddhist teaching, does not really exist; but the semblance of an individual, the phenomenal personality, is a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that cannot be denied, and must be explained. The Buddhists explain it by saying that it is a combination of Name and Form. In "Name" are included all the subjective phenomena of thought, namely, feeling, general notions, "conformations," and definite consciousness, which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "aggregations" (in Sanskrit, skandhas; in Pali, khandhas). "Form," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> the four elements of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> (earth, water, fire, and air) and their products, is a fifth khandha. As we have seen, the force that unites these five  into an apparent <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> or personality

[p. 16]

is what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> in Sanskrit karma, in Pali kamma, the resultant of all his previous acts. "When a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> dies, the khandhas of which he is constituted perish, but by the force of his kamma a new <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of khandhas instantly starts into existence, and a new being appears in another world, who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> possessing different khandhas and a different form, is in reality identical with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> just passed away, because his kamma, is the same.

To attain this <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> he must destroy his kamma; and this can be done by walking in the "Noble Path," which will infallibly lead him, either in his present birth or later, to final salvation.

This is, in broad outline, the teaching of Buddhism as it is understood by most Buddhists in Ceylon and Further India. In theory it verges <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> nihilistic idealism, for it regards all the data of finite experience as pure subjective phenomena corresponding to no objective reality, and created merely by the force of karma; there is no <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> than man's own will, and his karma to

But an important question arises here. Are the doctrines which we have outlined the original teaching of the Buddha, or do they not rather represent the opinions of the school which formed the Pali Canon some centuries after his death--a monastic fraternity with a strong bent towards rationalism? Even in this Canon the teachings ascribed to the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> are <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of logical inconsistencies.

But it seems most likely that the Buddha's real attitude was somewhat like that of the positivist and agnostic.

His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> aim was practical. He sought to impart a remedy for the world's sorrow, to teach his fellow-creatures an escape from. their karma and its fatal fruit of earthly birth. This remedy was the utter destruction of desire, even of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for salvation. It could be attained by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> or woman who renounced the world, entered into the monastic order, followed the "Noble Path," and in perfect calm and happiness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> waited until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> should open the portals of the unknowable, everlasting Stillness from which there is no return.

But there were other elements in the doctrine of early Buddhism which could not fail to bear fruit. As we have already remarked, it lays stress on the impermanence of beings: nothing finite exists in itself, everything is a collection of skandhas temporarily united. It is, in fact, a theory of "phenomenalism," and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> opened a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for development in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> directions. On the one <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> there grow up a school of nihilism, which dialectically established the non-existence of everything; on the other <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> arose an idealism which arrived at very similar conclusions.

In another and more practical issue the newer teaching departed from the old. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Gautama, according to the doctrine of his Church, was preceded by twenty-four other Buddhas, each of whom is supposed to have preached the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in different ages of the world. Now a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> can only attain the rank of Buddhahood after a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> course of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> progress in former births of the most various kinds. A being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> destined to Buddhahood is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a Bodhi-sattva, or "creature of enlightenment." At some point in his existence he has conceived an aspiration to become a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> for the salvation of his fellow-creatures, and thenceforth he advances in

A vast amount of Buddhist literature consists of Jatakas, or legends of the deeds in which the Bodhi-sattvas proved their fitness for their <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> mission.

It was around these points that the breach arose which split the Church into the divisions which we commonly and somewhat. inaccurately distinguish as Northern and Southern Buddhism. The older Buddhism that we have surveyed in. outline did not. give enough play for the elements of mysticism and emotion that have always been strong in the Hindu spirit. Its saints, the Arhats, were regularly ordained members of monastic fraternities, who sought salvation for themselves and denied Nirvana to laymen; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> their deeds of charity and other righteousness were incontestable, it was argued that their merit was marred by this self-seeking. Its theology was very sober, according to Indian standards; it tended towards intellectualism, and allowed little room for the large and highly coloured mythological imagination in which the

Many Buddhists also longed to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> a supreme God, to whom they could offer a <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> of the heart, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> personality could satisfy their restless imaginations. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> arose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the old foundations a new Church, a vast and gorgeous edifice of soaring fancy tenanted by countless Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas transfigured into a magnificent brilliance of godhead and worshipped with a passionate fervour of sell-surrendering love. The new Church held out to all alike the dazzling hope of Buddhahood. Every man, however humble or sinful, might become a Bodhisattva, a candidate for Buddhahood, and finally reach that <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> end, if he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> but will it so and hold to his purpose. <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas of the past, the omnipotent and omnipresent hierarchy of Heaven, and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for his fellow-creatures, manifested in perfect self-sacrifice for their needs, active compassion and charity, were the prime requisites for salvation. Inspired by this vivid energy, the new Buddhism speedily <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> possession of Northern India, Tibet, Central Asia, and China.

[p. 23]

That this movement was antinomian and fraught with danger from the first, is obvious. Its doctrine of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> unfettered by considerations of social expediency and ordinary morality, [*1] and the wild luxuriance of its myth, were capable of working harm as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as good, and in practice have often lent themselves to the most disgraceful abuse. But on this dark side of the picture we need not dwell here. It is enough that we should recognise that the Maha-yana, the "Great Vehicle," as the new Church proudly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> itself, in opposition to the more primitive Buddhism, which it scornfully styled Hina-yana, the "Little Vehicle," laid especial stress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the emotional side of religion and ethics, which had been somewhat neglected in the latter school, and that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> gained a novel character and significance.

In the doctrine of the older schools the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> was a teacher <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> enlightenment raised him above all the gods, hut withal a man, who had passed away from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> for ever, and could no more wield any influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it, save as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> and <span class="t2 t15 t24 hoverable">blessed</span> memory. His Nirvana was the same as that of any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who should attain it.

[p. 24]

could win for them that goal. Man's destiny is moulded by his own acts, his "karma," and each individual's karma concerns him alone, and cannot be applied for the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> weal of another. Lastly, as we have already remarked, salvation was confined to the monastic orders.

The Maha-yana changed almost everything. The <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> now appeared as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of the first order, invested with all the qualities that the most extravagant mythopoeic imagination could suggest. Like the conception of <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t13 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Christ</span> in the Docetic schools, he was imagined as existing throughout the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the cosmic period, in the "Body of Enjoyment" visible to the beatified Bodhi-sattvas, and the "Body of Magic Form" revealed to common mortals; and he was multiplied to infinity. Imagination created countless periods and countless domains, each under the presidency of a Buddha; and from the beginning of our era we observe that the historical Gautama. Buddha, even in his most mythical disguise, begins to fall into the background, whilst other figures of purely mythical origin become the first favourites of popular fancy. The most conspicuous of these is the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> Amitabha, "He of Infinite Light," a being of supreme splendour and grace; for now the Buddhas have become active dispensers of grace, at any rate from the standpoint of relative truth. Each <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> dwells in his paradise amidst a retinue of Bodhisattvas;

[p. 25]

of the latter the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> in rank serve as the ministers of his grace, constantly visiting the worlds under his rule in. the forms most suitable to their purpose, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to show their <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for suffering mortality by helping them in divers ways and leading them to paradise. The paradise of Amitabha is Sukavati, "The Happy Place," a fairyland which is tenanted by an entirely <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> population dwelling in perfect bliss. [*1] Amitabha's chief minister is Avalokites'vara, a Bodhi-sattva who has <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> a vow not to enter Nirvana until he has led thither all living creatures, and who for this supreme grace is worshipped throughout the North with a corresponding fervour of devotion. As a last development of this mythology, the Buddhas are associated with Taras, or Saviour-Ladies, who under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of sexual antithesis typify their consorts' energy of grace.

The moral standpoint is likewise changed. The ideal is no longer the calm, ascetic monk, waiting in cheerful tranquillity for the end, but the Bodhi-sattva, the self-appointed votary seeking eagerly to procure happiness for his fellow-creatures at any cost, even if he must surrender his own. right to <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> advancement as the price. For now is affirmed the principle of

[p. 26]

parinamana: the karma of an <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> is no longer confined to his experience, but can be made to redound to the benefit of others. The righteous can, of their own <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> will, <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> the merit of their own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds for the happiness of their fellow-creatures. Strictly speaking, as we shall see, the ideas of "self," "non-self," "happiness," and "suffering" are illusions. They are real only from the standpoint, of relative truth. But this condition of imperfect reality is inseparable from humanity; it must be accepted and made the basis of a moral activity which by perfect self-sacrifice purifies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> from the taint of finite error. And so Santi-deva ends his Bodhichayavatara with a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of prayer that the merit gained by him by his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> may not only uplift him to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> grades of beatification as a Bodhi-sattva, but may be also diverted for the benefit of fellow-creatures.

In its metaphysics the Maha-yana carried to a logical conclusion the nihilistic idealism that had begun to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> expression in the older schools.

While this theory of the "Body of Enjoyment" satisfied the hanger of the imagination for visions of paradise, the doctrine of the "Body of Magical Form" attempted to explain the appearance of Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of mortality. They never really appeared among men, and never will so appear, according to the Buddhist sages; they were but illusions, phantoms which the Buddhas and Bodhi-sattvas in their "Bodies of Enjoyment" created from their compassion to help and instruct the blind and sorrowing creatures of the world.

The current of mystic imagination which culminated in this bold theology seems to have arisen early. Possibly it may, in a rudimentary form, have been one of the elements of primitive Buddhism which were rejected as heretical by the more puritanic schools of the "Hina-yana." Certainly it was already <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> established before the Christian era, and the famous Council of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Kanishka gave official recognition to the Maha-yana doctrines, and apparently granted to them the royal favour.

half-legendary, half-historical character that is of singular interest. The real Nagarjuna, the scholar who founded the Madhyamika school, is overshadowed by the legendary Nagarjuna, the hero of a hundred myths in which he figures as a miracle-working saint who propagated his doctrine by the marvels of his magic. These wild legends have passed from Buddhist circles into the common stock of Hindu tradition, where he has become a typical sorcerer, to whom are ascribed many <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> on the black <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> and divination, notably the popular Kaksha-puta.

He systematised the old Maha-yana into the Madhyamika school, which by its vigorous dialectic became one of the most effective vehicles of Northern Buddhism. And it is to a follower of his school, S'anti-deva, who lived in the seventh century, or possibly somewhat earlier, that we owe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> works, the Bodhicharyavatara and the S'iksha-samuchchaya, in which are embodied the keenest logic and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> aspirations attained by the Buddhism of the North.

(2) The "Thought of Enlightenment" (Bodhi-chitta) is to the Maha-yana what 'grace' is to Christian theology. Buddhism, in common with the other schools of Indian thought, holds that all living <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are fettered in the beginningless and endless cycle of embodied births, metempsychosis or samsara, in which every instant of present experience is a resultant of former actions. Only the Buddhas, the loving teachers of salvation to mankind, have risen after aeons of effort in countless births into the transcendental peace of Nirvana. Hence the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious duty of the believer is aspiration to become a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> for the weal of fellow-creatures. This yearning arises in his heart, by the special grace of the Buddhas, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the Bodhi-chitta, which is finely expressed by our author in his <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> chapter. By this vow the believer constitutes himself a Bodhi-sattva, "or creature of enlightenment," of the first stage; he has devoted himself to the acquisition of merit by charity and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which shall raise him through <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes of existence, until he reaches the condition of the celestial Bodhi-sattvas, such as Manjughosha and Avalokites'vara, who have attained the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> beatification that the finite universe can give, and are only delaying their departure into the infinite stillness of Nirvana in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to continue their <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> as loving guides and helpers of mankind towards happiness and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> sanctification,

(12) These are the celestial Bodhi-sattvas (see notes 1, 2).

(13) "Stillness" is perhaps the mast suitable term to express the idea, of Nirvana; compare Denssen, Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie, bd. 1., abteil. 3, pp. 111 f., 152 f., etc. Nirvana does not signify extinction or annihilation, as is commonly imagined in Europe, but the very reverse, perfect <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> self-realisation in transcendental being. The metaphor first occurs in the Upanishads, and frequently reappears later in non-Buddhist theology; it denotes moksha, the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> in which the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> soul, identifying itself with universal Being, is entirely at rest in itself and in Brahma, in the stillness of infinite thought. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of delusion and earthly <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> has become extinguished in it by the annihilation of its feel, the false imagination of finite being. Nirvana is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> similar to the yoga, or ecstasy of the Yogic adept, which is technically defined as chitta-vritti-nirodha, cessation of the activity of the finite imagination, and it is frequently <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the same connection. Nirvana properly may denote either the blowing-out of a flame, or the burning of a flame undisturbed by wind (compare Bhagavad-gita, vi, 19). The latter interpretation will suit the oldest passages where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> occurs; but the former is also applicable, and is necessary in some of the later passages. Now the Buddhists denied the existence of a soul, or permanent Self. Logically, therefore, they could not assert the existence of a Nirvana, or transcendental existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Self; and theoretically, indeed, the Madhyamika

[p. 98]

school of the Maha-yana denied Nirvana, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> As finite being, substituting for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> the universal "Void," S'unya, which however is only another name for infinite) Being, the unqualified Transcendental. Buddhist orthodoxy refused to speculate on this antinomy. But in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as Buddhism, while denying the Brahmanic conception of the soul, substitutes for it the santana, or succession of moments of consciousness, which practically differs very little from it, so its conception of Nirvana practically amounted to much the same as the Brahmanic) ideal. See above, <page 19>.

(18) The remembrance is of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and of the teachings of his Church.

(19) The Perfect Charity (Dana-paramita) is not an actual deliverance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> from poverty (misery due to worldly desire), but an intention for such deliverance; it is a grace of the spirit. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> purity of the will is the greatest of all virtues, and the foundation of all, Similarly, the Perfect Conduct (S'ila-paramita), which is the subject of this chapter, consists essentially in the will to hurt no living creature.

(20) Morality is <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than charity, patience than morality, etc., and the aspirant to Buddhahood must not practise charity at the expense of morality, and so on. But this rule has an exception. The essential principle of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Bodhi-sattvas' conduct is s'iksha-samvara, "right and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span>

(21) The aspirant, having collected alms of <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> by begging from door to door, will divide it into four parts, one for each of the throe classes here mentioned, and one for himself. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> robes allowed to Buddhist devotees are of yellow rags.

It should be reserved for occasions when it will assist to enlightenment, etc., another aspirant of equal or greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> for good.

(23) The fundamental principle of Hindu medicine, like that of the Greeks, is the existence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> "humours" (dosha, dhatu), namely, wind, gall, and slime, which when in equipoise cause health, and when disturbed produce sickness.

(24) Here comes a polemic against the Sankhya and the Vedanti schools. The former divide existence into primal Matter and <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> souls which by connection with the former assume the functions of finite thought. The Vedantis believe in a single universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or Brahma, essentially indeterminate, which by the operation of the cosmic Illusion (Maya) differentiates itself into <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> finite souls. Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent soul, substituting for it a succession of instants of consciousness.

(25) It may be objected that if all action is a purely mechanical result of previously existent forces, the action of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in hatred, etc., is also mechanical, and cannot be checked, and hence the peace and salvation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> are unattainable. But this is not the case, according to our author. Existence is a series of forces proceeding one from the other (the pratitya-samutpada; but by arresting one of these the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> arrests all subsequent forces as far as he is concerned; and the primary force is ignorance.

(26) If I save myself from hell by refraining from retaliation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> those who wrong me, the merit of this is mine; and their merit, which consists in forcing me to suffer and expiate my guilt from former deeds, is not lessened by this merit of mine.

(27) The objector claims that, while he admits the merits of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> praised, he cannot abide the pleasure which the eulogist feels in praising him. But this is a sin. To every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must be given his just reward, both in this and other worlds; and both the eulogy and the eulogist's joy are part of the reward of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> eulogised.

(28) The presence of a pravrajuka, an ascetic who bas himself withdrawn from the world, causes us to perform the pravrajya, i.e. to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> from him the vows of his ascetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> and become a monk in his company.

(20) Living creatures are a "domain" (kshetra) for the acquisition of merit by the aspirants to enlightenment; for merit is gained by showing love, charity, etc., towards them. The Buddhas or "Conquerors" (Jina) are likewise a "domain"; merit is gained by doing service to them. (Cf. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 7 above.)

(30) Both Buddhas and inferior creatures alike assist the aspirant to win merit and become a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> himself. True, the Buddhas are immeasurably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and great, and are always consciously beneficent, while other creatures often are in their intention maleficent, But if we measure the worth of a purpose by its results, noting that wrong-doing is a "blessing in disguise" to the sufferer, we must conclude that the purpose of a Buddha's help is not more valuable to the aspirant than the various motives of other creatures with whom he has dealings.

(31) This refers to the Eastern custom of keeping fish alive in tanks until they are needed for the kitchen.

(33) This is a polemical reference to the Hina-yana school of Buddhism, of which the adepts (S'ravaka) sought enlightenment and Nirvana for themselves and by themselves.

[p. 101]

[paragraph continues] Is not such a course more rapid and sure than that recommended by our author, in which the aspirant to Buddhahood deliberately postpones his Nirvana in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> for the welfare of the world? S'anti-deva here brushes aside this objection. In his ninth chapter, in a <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> omitted in this translation, he attempts to prove that the Hina-yana can attain neither Nirvana nor suppression of passion.

[AS an epilogue to the Bodhi-charyavatara, I append a translation of the Karikas, or metrical summary of the main themes of S'anti-deva's other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> work, the S'iksha-samuchchaya.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> to the end that fellow-creatures may have the enjoyment thereof, one should protect his own <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> and the like, by leaving never the Blest Friend and by studying ever the Scriptures.

Now what means it to guard one's own person? to shun mishap. How is this all found? by shunning fruitless effort.

Fulfil this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> ever by mindfulness. From deep reverence springs mindfulness; and reverence, the <span class="t3 t22 t28 hoverable">glory</span> of the chastened spirit, arises from an understanding zeal.

"He that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> concentred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> understands

Steadfast throughout, mild of spirit, one Should by gentle address win over worthy men, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> become acceptable.

The worldly folk who scorn the scion of the Conqueror and accept him not shall be broiled in all the hells, like <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> hidden under ash.

Through this precept it is easy for him to guard his enjoyment.

By quenching the lust for issues of <span class="t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">thine</span> own advantage, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> righteousness will be <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> guarded.

[p. 106]

The Bodhi-sattva will dread gain and honour, will shun exaltation; he will have glad <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the Law, and dismiss doubts,

When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is made pure, it becomes wholesome for creatures to enjoy, like perfect spotless rice.

As a crop of grain overgrown by weeds sinks under disease, and thrives not, so a scion of the Buddha, if overcome by sin, cannot grow in grace.

What is the "cleansing of our person"? Cleansing it of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and sin, in obedience to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the Enlightened.

<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">Full</span> many there are who will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> from thee.

What is increase of the body? increase of strength and energy. Increase of enjoyment is from almsgiving <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of tenderness and the.

The rule of right conduct--worship and the like--should ever be reverently observed. Let <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and the like be always practised, likewise brotherly <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and the remembrance of the Buddha.

In short, the weal of fellow-beings in all conditions, the godly gift <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> worldly desire, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Thought</span> of Enlightenment cause righteousness to increase.

Perfection arises from constancy in the heedful effort to make right renunciations, by remembrance, by attention, and by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> meditation.
