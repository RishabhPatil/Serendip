The purpose of this <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is not the enunciation of any special

opposed to each other and which often serve to discourage and disgust
the beginner in the study. Our intent is not to erect a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> Temple of

if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage, Hermes
was, and is, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Central <span class="t3 t4 t6 t8 t19 hoverable">Sun</span> of Occultism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> rays have served

the Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views, and

correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the Hermetic
Teachings act as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Reconciler.

The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of planting
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Seed-Truth which has grown and blossomed in so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> strange

dominate, the world's thought. But, nevertheless, the original truths
taught by him have been kept intact in their original purity by a few
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> each age, who, refusing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers of half-developed students and
followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> for the
few who were ready to comprehend and master it. From lip to ear the
<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> has been handed down <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the few. There have always been a few
Initiates in each generation, in the various lands of the earth, who
kept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have
always been willing to use their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of
the outside world, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> grew dim, and clouded by
reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign
matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the
Truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom. These
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> devoted their lives to the labor of <span class="t15 hoverable">love</span> which the poet has so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
stated in his lines:

     "O, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> not the flame die out! Cherished age after age
     in its dark cavern--in its <span class="t1 t11 t13 t16 t21 t23 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> temples cherished. Fed
     by pure ministers of love--let not the flame die out!"

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers.
They are indifferent to these things, for they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> how few there are in
each generation who are ready for the truth, or who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> recognize it
if it were presented to them. They reserve the "strong meat for men,"
while <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> furnish the "milk for babes." They reserve their pearls of
wisdom for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in
their crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar
swine, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> trample them in the mud and mix them with their
disgusting mental food. But still these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> forgotten or
overlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of
the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> to those ready to receive it, which teaching is
stated in The Kybalion as follows: "Where fall the footsteps of the
Master, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide." And again:
"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to
fill them with wisdom." But their customary attitude has always been
strictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in The
Kybalion: "The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of
Understanding."

There are those who have criticized this attitude of the Hermetists, and
who have claimed that they did not manifest the proper <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in their

willing to receive. The Hermetists have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> sought to be martyrs, and
have, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their closed
lips, while the "heathen raged noisily about them" in their customary
amusement of putting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and torture the honest but misguided

THE HERMETIC PHILOSOPHY

    "The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears
    of Understanding"--The Kybalion.

From <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Egypt have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> the fundamental esoteric and occult teachings
which have so strongly influenced the philosophies of all races, nations
and peoples, for several thousand years. Egypt, the home of the Pyramids
and the Sphinx, was the birthplace of the Hidden Wisdom and Mystic
Teachings. From her Secret Doctrine all nations have borrowed. India,
Persia, Chaldea, Medea, China, Japan, Assyria, ancient Greece and Rome,
and other ancient countries partook liberally at the feast of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

together.

In ancient Egypt dwelt the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Adepts and Masters who have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> been
surpassed, and who seldom have been equaled, during the centuries that
have taken their processional flight <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Hermes.
In Egypt was located the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. At the
doors of her Temples entered the Neophytes who afterward, as
Hierophants, Adepts, and Masters, traveled to the four corners of the
earth, carrying with them the precious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which they were ready,
anxious, and willing to <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> on to those who were ready to receive the
same. All students of the Occult recognize the debt that they owe to
these venerable Masters of that ancient land.

But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Masters of Ancient Egypt there once dwelt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of
whom Masters hailed as "The Master of Masters." This man, if "man"
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest days. He was <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as
Hermes Trismegistus. He was the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the Occult Wisdom; the founder
of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> story

the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the

ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on
this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span>
of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the <span class="t5 t8 t10 t17 t18 t21 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Moses. The
best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of
the Jewish traditions go so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as to claim that Abraham acquired a
portion of his mystic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from Hermes himself.

As the <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> rolled by after his passing from this plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

The

calling him "the Scribe of the Gods," and bestowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him,

thrice-great"; "the great-great"; "the greatest-great"; etc. In all the
ancient lands, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span>
being synonymous with the "Fount of Wisdom."

"sealed so that <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> can escape"; etc., and this by reason of the
fact that the followers of Hermes always observed the principle of
secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in "casting pearls
before swine," but rather held to the teaching "milk for babes"; "meat
for strong men," both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the
Christian scriptures, but both of which had been used by the Egyptians
for centuries before the Christian era.

And this policy of careful dissemination of the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> has always
characterized the Hermetics, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> day. The Hermetic
Teachings are to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in all lands, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> all religions, but <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span>
identified with any particular country, nor with any particular
religious sect. This because of the warning of the ancient teachers
against allowing the Secret Doctrine to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> crystallized into a
creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of
history. The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was
largely lost, owing to the fact that the teachers became priests, and so
mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism
of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious
superstition, cults, creeds and "gods." So it was with Ancient Greece
and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and
Early Christians, which were lost at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Constantine, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> iron

Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing
it to grope throughout several centuries before it <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to
its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in
this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get
back to its ancient mystic teachings.

But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the Flame,
tending it carefully, and not allowing its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> extinguished.
And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless minds, we have the
<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> still with us.  But it is not <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in books, to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent.

in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> books written on various phases of Occultism. And yet, the
Hermetic Philosophy is the only Master Key which will open all the doors
of the Occult Teachings!

In the early days, there was a compilation of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> Basic Hermetic
Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, which was <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as "THE
KYBALION," the exact significance and <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term having been
lost for several centuries. This teaching, however, is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> to
whom it has descended, from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the
centuries. Its precepts have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> been written down, or printed, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
as we know. It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts,
which were non-understandable to outsiders, but which were readily
understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been
explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes.
These teachings really constituted the basic principles of "The <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">Art</span> of
Hermetic Alchemy," which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the
mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements-the
Transmutation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of
the changing of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> kind of metal into another. The legends of the
"Philosopher's Stone" which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> turn base metal into Gold, was an
allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all
students of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Hermeticism.

THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES

    "The Principles of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> are Seven; he who knows these,
    understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>
    touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open."--The Kybalion.

The Seven Hermetic Principles, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the entire Hermetic Philosophy
is based, are as follows:

    1. The Principle of Mentalism.
    2. The Principle of Correspondence.
    3. The Principle of Vibration.
    4. The Principle of Polarity.
    5. The Principle of Rhythm.
    6. The Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect.
    7. The Principle of Gender.

These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed
with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> be

1.  The Principle of Mentalism

    "THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that "All is Mind." It explains that
THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward
manifestations and appearances which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> under the terms of "The
Material Universe"; the "Phenomena of Life"; "Matter"; "Energy"; and, in
short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">SPIRIT</span> which in
itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be considered and
<span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> explains that
all the phenomenal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> or universe is simply a Mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> of THE
ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a
whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE
ALL, in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> we "live and move and have our being." This
Principle, by establishing the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> of the Universe, easily
explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such
a large portion of the public attention, and which, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> such
explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. An
understanding of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the
<span class="t4 hoverable">individual</span> to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to
apply the same to his well-being and advancement. The Hermetic Student
is enabled to apply intelligently the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Mental Laws, instead of
using them in a haphazard manner. With the Master-Key in his possession,
the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> unlock the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> doors of the mental and psychic temple
of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This
Principle explains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of "Energy," "Power," and "Matter,"
and why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of
the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Hermetic Masters wrote, <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> ages ago: "He who grasps the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span>

Mastery." And these <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> are as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> today as at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they were

student knocks in vain at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> doors of The Temple.

2.  The Principle of Correspondence

    "As above, so below; as below, so above."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that there is always a Correspondence
between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life.
The <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Hermetic axiom ran in these words: "As above, so below; as
below, so above." And the grasping of this Principle gives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
of solving <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are
planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of
Correspondence to them we are able to understand <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal
application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material,
mental, and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient
Hermetists considered this Principle as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most important mental
instruments by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid
from view the Unknown. Its use <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> tore aside the Veil of Isis to the
extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be caught. Just

intelligently from the <span class="t2 hoverable">Known</span> to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he
understands the archangel.

3.  The Principle of Vibration

    "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."--The
    Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that "everything is in motion";
"everything vibrates"; "nothing is at rest"; facts which Modern Science
endorses, and which each <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> scientific discovery tends to verify.  And
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, by
the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the
differences between <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From
THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Matter, all
is in vibration--the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> the vibration, the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> the position in
the scale. The vibration of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is at such an infinite rate of
intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly
moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the scale,
there are gross forms of matter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> vibrations are so low as to seem
at rest. Between these poles, there are millions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> millions of
varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and
molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.
This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> on the planes of energy and force (which are but
varying degrees of vibration); and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> on the mental planes (whose
states depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> vibrations); and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> on to the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes.
An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas,
enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
as those of others. The Masters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> apply this Principle to the
conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. "He who understands
the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power," <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
of the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> writers.

4.  The Principle of Polarity

    "Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its
    pair of opposites; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> and unlike are the same; opposites are
    identical in nature, but <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in degree; extremes meet;
    all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
    reconciled."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that "everything is dual"; "everything
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles"; "everything has its pair of opposites," all of which
were <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> Hermetic axioms. It explains the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> paradoxes, that have
perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: "Thesis and
antithesis are identical in nature, but <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in degree"; "opposites
are the same, differing only in degree"; "the pairs of opposites <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be
reconciled"; "extremes meet"; "everything is and isn't, at the same
time"; "all truths are but half-truths"; "every <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is half-false";
"there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides to everything," etc., etc., etc. It explains that
in everything there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles, or opposite aspects, and that
"opposites" are really only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremes of the same thing, with
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold,
although "opposites," are really the same thing, the differences
consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> if you can discover where "heat" terminates and "cold" begins!
There is no such <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as "absolute heat" or "absolute cold"--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
terms "heat" and "cold" simply indicate varying degrees of the same
thing, and that "same thing" which manifests as "heat" and "cold"
is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So "heat" and "cold"
are simply the "two poles" of that which we call "Heat"--and the
phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of
Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of "Light and
Darkness," which are the same thing, the difference consisting of
varying degrees between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of the phenomena. Where does
"darkness" leave off, and "light" begin? What is the difference between
"Large and Small"? Between "Hard and Soft"? Between "Black and White"?
Between "Sharp and Dull"? Between "Noise and Quiet"? Between "High and
Low"? Between "Positive and Negative"? The Principle of Polarity
explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The
same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> a radical and
extreme example--that of "Love and Hate," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mental states apparently
totally different.  And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there are degrees of Hate and degrees of
Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms "Like or Dislike,"
which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> whether we "like" or "dislike" or "neither." And all are simply
degrees of the same thing, as you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> if you will but think a
moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance
by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to
the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the
involuntary rapid transition from <span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> to Hate, and the reverse, in your
own <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> and that of others.  And you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> realize the
possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span>
of the Hermetic formulas. "Good and Evil" are but the poles of the same
thing, and the Hermetist understands the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> of transmuting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> into
Good, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,
the "Art of Polarization" becomes a phase of "Mental Alchemy" <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> and
practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding
of the Principle will enable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to change his own Polarity, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
that of others, if he will devote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and study necessary to master
the art.

5.  The Principle of Rhythm

    "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;
    all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in
    everything; the measure of the swing to the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> is the
    measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."--The
    Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that in everything there is manifested
a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and
forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide
and low-tide; between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles which exist in accordance with the
Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action
and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This
is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,
energy, and matter.  This <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> is manifest in the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and
destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
all things; and finally in the mental states of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> (and it is with this
latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most
important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its
universal application, and have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> discovered <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> to
overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate
formulas and methods. They apply the Mental <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Neutralization. They
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> annul the Principle, or <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> it to cease its operation, but they
have learned how to escape its effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> themselves to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>
degree depending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned
how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar
methods, consist the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">Art</span> of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics
polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then
neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> tend to carry
him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of
Self-Mastery do this to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> degree, more or less unconsciously,
but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and
attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of
belief on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the masses who are swung backward and forward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely
studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting,
neutralizing, and USING them <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> an important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Hermetic
Mental Alchemy.

6.  The Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect

    "Every <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> has its Effect; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Effect has its Cause;
    everything happens <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Law; Chance is but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span>
    for <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> not recognized; there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> planes of causation,
    but <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> escapes the Law."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the fact that there is a <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Effect;
an Effect from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> Cause. It explains that:  "Everything Happens
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to Law"; that <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> ever "merely happens"; that there is no
such <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as Chance; that while there are various planes of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and
Effect, the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> dominating the lower planes, still <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> ever
entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> and methods
of rising above the ordinary plane of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect, to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>
degree, and by mentally rising to a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane they <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> Causers
instead of Effects. The masses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are carried along, obedient to
environment; the wills and desires of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> stronger than themselves;
heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
pawns on the Chessboard of Life. But the Masters, rising to the plane
above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>
as the environment surrounding them, and <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> Movers instead of pawns.
They help to PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE, instead of being played and moved
about by other wills and environment. They USE the Principle instead of
being its tools. The Masters obey the Causation of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes,
but they help to RULE on their own plane. In this statement there is
condensed a wealth of Hermetic knowledge--let him read who can.

7.  The Principle of Gender

As we have stated, the Hermetists were the original alchemists,
astrologers, and psychologists, Hermes having been the founder of these
schools of thought. From astrology has grown modern astronomy; from
alchemy has grown modern chemistry; from the mystic psychology has grown
the modern psychology of the schools. But it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not be supposed that
the ancients were ignorant of that which the modern schools suppose to
be their exclusive and special property. The records engraved on the
stones of Ancient Egypt show conclusively that the ancients had a full
comprehensive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of astronomy, the very building of the Pyramids
showing the connection between their design and the study of
astronomical science. Nor were they ignorant of Chemistry, for the
fragments of the ancient writings show that they were acquainted with
the chemical properties of things; in fact, the ancient theories
regarding physics are being slowly verified by the latest discoveries of
modern science, notably those relating to the constitution of matter.
Nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> it be supposed that they were ignorant of the so-called modern
discoveries in psychology--on the contrary, the Egyptians were
especially skilled in the science of Psychology, particularly in the
branches that the modern schools ignore, but which, nevertheless, are
being uncovered under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of "psychic science" which is perplexing
the psychologists of to-day, and making them reluctantly admit that

The <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is, that beneath the material chemistry, astronomy and
psychology (that is, the psychology in its phase of "brain-action") the
ancients possessed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of transcendental astronomy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>

along the same general lines, for there is but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> principle involved,

THE ALL

    "Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change,
    is ever to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental
    Truth."--The Kybalion.

"Substance" means: "that which underlies all outward manifestations; the
essence; the essential reality; the <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> in itself," etc. "Substantial"
means: "actually existing; being the essential element; being real," etc.
"Reality" means: "the state of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed;
permanent; actual," etc.

Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> considering the
Universe, of which he is a unit, sees <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> but change in matter,
forces, and mental states. He sees that <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> really IS, but that
everything is BECOMING and CHANGING. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> stands still-everything is
being born, growing, dying-the very instant a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> reaches its height,
it begins to decline--the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of rhythm is in constant operation--there
is no reality, enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything--
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> is permanent but Change. He sees all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> evolving from other
things, and resolving into other things--constant action and reaction;
inflow and outflow; building up and tearing down; <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and
destruction; birth, growth and death. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> endures but Change. And if
he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying
Power--some Substantial Reality.

All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity
for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All
philosophies worthy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> have been based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this thought. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span>

Infinite and Eternal Energy" <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> have tried to call it "Matter"--but
all have acknowledged its existence. It is self-evident it needs no

In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's
greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the

comprehensive of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> terms applied by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> to THAT which transcends
names and terms.

We accept and teach the view of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hermetic thinkers of all

planes of being, both of whom assert that the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL is

The Hermetists believe and teach that THE ALL, "in itself," is and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>

and standing just where he started.

And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL
the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes
of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> emotions, feelings, and

of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, and are

Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in
considering that THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin
to the process whereby <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> creates Mental Images. And, here is where the
report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as
shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the
Wise Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes.

THE ALL can create in no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> except mentally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> either using

Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> teachings of the
Illumined. Just as you, student, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> create a Universe of your own in
your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality.
But your Universe is the mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of a Finite Mind, whereas that
of THE ALL is the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of an Infinite. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are similar in kind,

point to fix in your minds at this stage: THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT
CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">CREATION</span> OF THE ALL. Verily indeed, ALL IS MIND!

    "THE ALL creates in its Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> countless Universes,

material manifestation of gender. "Gender" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> "relating to generation
or creation." And whenever anything is generated or created, on any
plane, the Principle of Gender <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be manifested. And this is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
in the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of Universes.

Now do not jump to the conclusion that we are teaching that there is a
male and female God, or Creator. That idea is merely a distortion of the
ancient teachings on the subject. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> teaching is that THE ALL, in
itself, is above Gender, as it is above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> other Law, including those
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> and Space. It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is
not subject to them. But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of
generation or creation, then it acts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and Principle, for
it is moving on a lower plane of Being. And consequently it manifests
the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the
Mental Plane, of course.

This idea <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> seem startling to some of you who hear it for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
time, but you have all really passively accepted it in your everyday
conceptions. You speak of the Fatherhood of God, and the Motherhood of
Nature--of God, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Father, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> the Universal Mother--and

Universe. Is this not so?

But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality--THE ALL is
ONE--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Aspects are merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching
is that The Masculine Principle manifested by THE ALL stands, in a way,
apart from the actual mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe. It projects its
Will toward the Feminine Principle (which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Nature")
whereupon the latter begins the actual <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the evolution of the

THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">DIVINE</span> PARADOX

    "The half-wise, recognizing the comparative unreality of

    are vain and presumptuous fools, and they are broken against
    the rocks and torn asunder by the elements by reason of

    the pains of the lower planes by vibrating on the higher.
    Transmutation, not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the
    Master."--The Kybalion.

This is the Paradox of the Universe, resulting from the Principle of
Polarity which manifests when THE ALL begins to Create--hearken to it
for it points the difference between half-wisdom and wisdom. While to
THE INFINITE ALL, the Universe, its Laws, its Powers, its life, its
Phenomena, are as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> witnessed in the state of Meditation or Dream;

to half-wisdom, acts and lives and thinks of the Universe as merely a
dream (akin to his own finite dreams) then <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> does it so <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> for
him, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a sleep-walker he stumbles ever around and around in a
circle, making no progress, and being forced into an awakening at last
by his falling bruised and bleeding over the Natural Laws which he
ignored.

your footsteps, lest you fall into the mire by reason of your upward

IT IS. Remember ever the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Poles of <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> the Absolute and the
Relative. Beware of Half-Truths.

What Hermetists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> as "the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Paradox" is an aspect of the
Principle of Polarity. The Hermetic writings are filled with references
to the appearance of the Paradox in the consideration of the problems of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and Being. The Teachers are constantly warning their students
against the error of omitting the "other side" of any question. And
their warnings are particularly directed to the problems of the Absolute
and the Relative, which perplex all students of philosophy, and which
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> to think and act contrary to what is generally <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as
"common sense." And we caution all students to be sure to grasp the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Paradox of the Absolute and Relative, lest they <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> entangled
in the mire of the Half-Truth. With this in view this particular lesson
has been written. Read it carefully!

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> that comes to the thinking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> after he realizes the
<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that the Universe is a Mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> of THE ALL, is that the
Universe and all that it contains is a mere illusion; an unreality;
against which idea his instincts revolt. But this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

points of view. From the Absolute viewpoint, of course, the Universe is
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of an illusion, a dream, a phantasmagoria, as compared to
THE ALL in itself. We recognize this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in our ordinary view, for we
speak of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as "a fleeting show" that comes and goes, is born and
dies--for the element of impermanence and change, finiteness and
unsubstantiality, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> ever be connected with the idea of a created
Universe when it is contrasted with the idea of THE ALL, no matter what
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be our beliefs concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of both. Philosopher,
metaphysician, scientist and theologian all agree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this idea, and
the <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> is <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> in all forms of philosophical <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> and religious
conceptions, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as in the theories of the respective schools of
metaphysics and theology.

So, the Hermetic Teachings do not preach the unsubstantiality of the
Universe in any stronger terms than those more familiar to you, although
their presentation of the subject <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> seem somewhat more startling.
Anything that has a beginning and an ending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be, in a sense, unreal
and untrue, and the Universe comes under the rule, in all schools of
thought. From the Absolute point of view, there is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> Real except
THE ALL, no matter what terms we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> use in thinking of, or discussing
the subject. Whether the Universe be created of Matter, or whether it be
a Mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL--it is unsubstantial,
non-enduring, a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> of time, space and change. We want you to realize
this fact thoroughly, before you <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> judgment on the Hermetic
conception of the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe. Think over any and all
of the other conceptions, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> whether this be not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of them.

But the Absolute point of view shows merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side of the picture--the
other side is the Relative one. Absolute <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> has been defined as
"Things as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> knows them," while Relative <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> is "Things
as the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> reason of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> understands them." And so while to THE ALL
the Universe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be unreal and illusionary, a mere dream or result of
meditation,--nevertheless, to the finite minds forming a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of that
Universe, and viewing it through mortal faculties, the Universe is very
real indeed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be so considered. In recognizing the Absolute
view, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the mistake of ignoring or denying the facts and
phenomena of the Universe as they <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> themselves to our mortal
faculties--we are not THE ALL, remember.

To <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> familiar illustrations, we all recognize the fact that matter
"exists" to our senses--we will fare badly if we do not. And yet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
our finite minds understand the scientific dictum that there is no such
<span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as Matter from a scientific point of view--that which we call
Matter is held to be merely an aggregation of atoms, which atoms
themselves are merely a grouping of units of force, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> electrons or
"ions," vibrating and in constant circular motion. We kick a stone and
we feel the impact--it seems to be real, notwithstanding that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> it
to be merely what we have stated above. But remember that our foot,
which feels the impact by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of our brains, is likewise Matter, so
constituted of electrons, and for that matter so are our brains. And, at
the best, if it were not by reason of our Mind, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> the
foot or stone at all.

Then again, the ideal of the artist or sculptor, which he is endeavoring
to reproduce in stone or on canvas, seems very real to him. So do the
characters in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the author; or dramatist, which he seeks to
express so that <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> recognize them. And if this be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in the
<span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> of our finite minds, what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be the degree of Reality in the
Mental Images created in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> of the Infinite? Oh, friends, to

THE ALL itself. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> we rise in the scale--the
nearer to "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of the Father" we reach--the more apparent becomes
the illusory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of finite things, but not until THE ALL finally
withdraws us into itself does the vision actually vanish.

So, we need not dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the feature of illusion. Rather <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us,
recognizing the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe, seek to understand its
mental laws, and endeavor to use them to the best effect in our upward
progress through life, as we travel from plane to plane of being. The
Laws of the Universe are none the less "Iron Laws" because of the mental
nature. All, except THE ALL, are bound by them. What is IN THE INFINITE
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">MIND</span> OF THE ALL is REAL in a degree second only to that Reality itself
which is vested in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL.

So, do not feel insecure or afraid--we are all HELD FIRMLY IN THE
INFINITE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">MIND</span> OF THE ALL, and there is naught to hurt us or for us to
fear. There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> outside of THE ALL to affect us. So we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> rest
calm and secure. There is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of comfort and security in this
realization when once attained. Then "calm and peaceful do we sleep,
rocked in the Cradle of the Deep"--resting safely on the bosom of the
Ocean of Infinite Mind, which is THE ALL. In THE ALL, indeed, do "we

Matter is none the less Matter to us, while we dwell on the plane of
Matter, although we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> it to be merely an aggregation of "electrons,"
or particles of Force, vibrating rapidly and gyrating around each other
in the formations of atoms; the atoms in turn vibrating and gyrating,
forming molecules, which latter in turn <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> larger masses of Matter.
Nor does Matter <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> less Matter, when we follow the inquiry still
further, and learn from the Hermetic Teachings, that the "Force" of
which the electrons are but units is merely a manifestation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span>

nature. While on the Plane of matter, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> recognize its phenomena--

but we do so by applying the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> forces. We commit a folly when we
attempt to deny the existence of Matter in the relative aspect. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>

still <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> ones--and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> only.

these are bound by and are subservient to Law, then imagine the

he happens to be able to grasp the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that the Laws are Mental in
nature, and simply Mental Creations of THE ALL. Those Laws which THE ALL
intends to be governing Laws are not to be defied or argued away. So
<span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> as the Universe endures, will they endure--for the Universe exists
by virtue of these Laws which <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> its framework and which hold it
together.

The Hermetic Principle of Mentalism, while explaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of
the Universe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the principle that all is Mental, does not change the
scientific conceptions of the Universe, Life, or Evolution. In fact,
science merely corroborates the Hermetic Teachings. The latter merely
teaches that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe is "Mental," while modern
science has taught that it is "Material"; or (of late) that it is
"Energy" at the last analysis. The Hermetic Teachings have no fault to
find with Herbert Spencer's basic principle which postulates the
existence of an "Infinite and Eternal Energy, from which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
proceed." In fact, the Hermetics recognize in Spencer's philosophy the
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> outside statement of the workings of the Natural Laws that have
ever been promulgated, and they believe Spencer to have been a
reincarnation of an ancient philosopher who dwelt in ancient Egypt
thousands of <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, and who later incarnated as Heraclitus, the
Grecian philosopher who lived B. C. 500. And they regard his statement
of the "Infinite and Eternal Energy" as directly in the line of the
Hermetic Teachings, always with the addition of their own doctrine
that his "Energy" is the Energy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL. With the
Master-Key of the Hermetic Philosophy, the student of Spencer will be
able to unlock <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> doors of the inner philosophical conceptions of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> English philosopher, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> shows the results of the
preparation of his previous incarnations. His teachings regarding
Evolution and Rhythm are in almost perfect agreement with the Hermetic
Teachings regarding the Principle of Rhythm.

So, the student of Hermetics need not lay aside any of his cherished
scientific views regarding the Universe. All he is asked to do is to
grasp the underlying principle of "THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is
Mental--held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of THE ALL." He will find that the other six of
the Seven Principles will "fit into" his scientific knowledge, and will
serve to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> out obscure points and to throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> in dark corners.
This is not to be wondered at, when we realize the influence of the
Hermetic <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> of the early philosophers of Greece, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span>
foundations of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> the theories of modern science largely rest. The
acceptance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> Hermetic Principle (Mentalism) is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
point of difference between Modern Science and Hermetic students, and
Science is gradually moving toward the Hermetic position in its groping
in the dark for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> out of the Labyrinth into which it has wandered in
its search for Reality.

The purpose of this lesson is to impress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the minds of our students
the fact that, to all intents and purposes, the Universe and its laws,
and its phenomena, are just as REAL, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is concerned, as they

hypothesis the Universe in its outer aspect is changing, ever-flowing,
and transitory--and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> devoid of substantiality and reality. But
(note the other pole of the truth) under the same hypotheses, we are
compelled to ACT AND LIVE as if the fleeting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> were real and
substantial. With this difference, always, between the various
hypotheses--that under the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> views Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> was ignored as a
Natural Force, while under Mentalism it becomes the Greatest Natural
Force. And this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> difference revolutionizes Life, to those who
understand the Principle and its resulting laws and practice.

So, finally, students all, grasp the advantage of Mentalism, and learn
to know, use and apply the laws resulting therefrom. But do not yield to
the temptation which, as The Kybalion states, overcomes the half-wise
and which causes them to be hypnotized by the apparent unreality of
things, the consequence being that they wander about <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> dream-people

man, the <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> being that "they are broken against the rocks and torn
asunder by the elements, by reason of their folly." Rather follow the
example of the wise, which the same authority states, "use <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> against
Laws; the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> against the lower; and by the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">Art</span> of Alchemy transmute
that which is undesirable into that which is worthy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> triumph."
Following the authority, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us avoid the half-wisdom (which is folly)
which ignores the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that: "Mastery consists not in abnormal dreams,
visions, and fantastic imaginings or living, but in using the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>
forces against the lower--escaping the pains of the lower planes by
vibrating on the higher." Remember always, student, that "Transmutation,
not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the Master." The above
quotations are from The Kybalion, and are worthy of being committed to
memory by the student.

We do not live in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of dreams, but in an Universe which while
relative, is real so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as our lives and actions are concerned. Our
business in the Universe is not to deny its existence, but to LIVE,
using the Laws to rise from lower to higher--living on, doing the best
that we can under the circumstances arising each day, and living, so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
as is possible, to our biggest ideas and ideals. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">Meaning</span> of

their folly.

    "While All is in THE ALL, it is equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that THE

How often have the majority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> heard repeated the statement that
their Deity (called by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> names) was "All in All" and how little have
they suspected the inner occult <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> concealed by these carelessly
uttered words? The commonly used expression is a survival of the ancient
Hermetic Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: "To him who truly
understands this truth, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> knowledge." And, this being so,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us seek this truth, the understanding of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> so much. In
this statement of truth--this Hermetic Maxim--is concealed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the
greatest philosophical, scientific and religious truths.

We have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> of
the Universe--the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that "the Universe is Mental--held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span>
of THE ALL." As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: "All is
in THE ALL." But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the co-related statement, that: "It is
equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that THE ALL is in ALL." This apparently contradictory
statement is reconcilable under the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Paradox. It is, moreover, an
exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and
its Mental Universe. We have seen how "All is in THE ALL"--now <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us
examine the other aspect of the subject.

The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in
("remaining within; inherent; abiding within") its Universe, and in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> part, particle, unit, or combination, <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> the Universe. This
statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the
Principle of Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> a
Mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental
form, the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming
an idea of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of
an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student
will find that while the image has its existence, and being, solely
<span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> his own mind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or
sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding
within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life,
spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the "immanent
mind" of the thinker. Consider this for a moment, until the idea is
grasped.

Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah Heep--is it Dickens, or have each of these
characters a personal spirit, independent of their creator? Have the
Venus of Medici, the Sistine Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and
reality of their own, or do they represent the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> and mental

propositions are true, viewed from the proper viewpoints. Micawber is
both Micawber, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> Dickens. And, again, while Micawber <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>

and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> I am not HE!" How <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> this from the shocking half-truth so
vociferously announced by <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> of the half-wise, who fill the air
with their raucous cries of: "I am God!" Imagine poor Micawber, or the
sneaky Uriah Heep, crying: "I Am Dickens"; or some of the lowly clods in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of Shakespeare's plays, eloquently announcing that: "I Am
Shakespeare!" THE ALL is in the earthworm, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the earth-worm is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
from being THE ALL. And still the wonder remains, that <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">though</span> the

earthworm, and in the particles that go to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> up the earth-worm. Can
there be any greater mystery than this of "All in THE ALL; and THE ALL
in All?"

The student will, of course, realize that the illustrations <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> above
are necessarily imperfect and inadequate, for they represent the
<span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of mental images in finite minds, while the Universe is a
<span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of Infinite Mind--and the difference between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles
separates them. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> it is merely a matter of degree--the same
Principle is in operation--the Principle of Correspondence manifests in
each--"As above, so Below; as Below, so above."

And, in the degree that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> realizes the existence of the Indwelling

of life. This is what <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> development means--the recognition,
realization, and manifestation of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> us. Try to remember
this last definition--that of <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> development. It contains the
<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">Truth</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Religion.

There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> planes of Being--many sub-planes of Life--many degrees of
existence in the Universe. And all depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the advancement of beings
in the scale, of which scale the lowest point is the grossest matter,
the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> being separated only by the thinnest division from the
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">SPIRIT</span> of THE ALL. And, upward and onward along this Scale of Life,
everything is moving. All are on the Path, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> is THE ALL. All
progress is a Returning Home. All is Upward and Onward, in spite of all
seemingly contradictory appearances. Such is the message of the
Illumined.

The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> of
the Universe, are that at the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL,
in its aspect of Being, projects its Will toward its aspect of
"Becoming" and the process of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> begins. It is taught that the
process consists of the lowering of Vibration until a very low degree of
vibratory energy is reached, at which point the grossest possible <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span>
of Matter is manifested. This process is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the stage of Involution,
in which THE ALL becomes "involved," or "wrapped up," in its creation.
This process is believed by the Hermetists to have a Correspondence to
the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so
wrapped up in his mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> as to almost forget his own existence
and who, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, almost "lives in his creation," If instead
of "wrapped" we use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "rapt," perhaps we will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a better idea
of what is meant.

This Involuntary stage of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">Creation</span> is sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "Outpouring"
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
"Indrawing." The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to
be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the
Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of
the pendulum of Rhythm--a "coming home" idea being held in all of the
Hermetic Teachings.

The Teachings are that during the "Outpouring," the vibrations <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span>
lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing
begins. But there is this difference, that while in the "Outpouring" the
creative forces manifest compactly and as a whole, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> from the
beginning of the Evolutionary or "Indrawing" stage, there is manifested
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Individualization--that is, the tendency to separate into
Units of Force, so that finally that which left THE ALL as
unindividualized energy returns to its source as countless highly
developed Units of Life, having risen <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> of Physical, Mental and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Evolution.

The ancient Hermetists use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Meditation" in describing the

But the idea
intended seems to be that of the employment of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Attention.
"Attention" is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> derived from the Latin root, <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> "to reach
out; to stretch out," and so the act of Attention is really a mental
"reaching out; extension" of mental energy, so that the underlying idea
is readily understood when we examine into the real <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of
"Attention."

The Hermetic Teachings regarding the process of Evolution are that, THE
ALL, having meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the beginning of the Creation--having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
established the material foundations of the Universe--having <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> it
into existence--then gradually awakens or rouses from its Meditation and
in so doing starts into manifestation the process of Evolution, on the
material mental and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes, successively and in order. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
the upward movement begins--and all begins to move Spiritward. Matter
becomes less gross; the Units spring into being; the combinations begin
to form; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> appears and manifests in <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span>
becomes more and more in evidence--the vibrations constantly becoming
higher. In short, the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases,
begins, and proceeds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the established "Laws of the
Indrawing" process. All of this occupies aeons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> aeons of Man's time,

inform us that the entire creation, including Involution and Evolution,
of an Universe, is but "as the twinkle of the eye" to THE ALL.  At the
<span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE ALL withdraws its
Attention--its Contemplation and Meditation--of the Universe, for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Work</span> is finished--and All is withdrawn into THE ALL from which it
emerged. But Mystery of Mysteries--the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not
annihilated, but is infinitely expanded--the Created and the Creator are
merged. Such is the report of the Illumined!

The above illustration of the "meditation," and subsequent "awakening
from meditation," of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the
teachers to describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet:
"As Below, so Above." The difference is merely in degree. And just as
THE ALL arouses itself from the meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Universe, so does

withdraws himself more and more into the Indwelling Spirit, which is
<span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span> "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Ego."

There is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> more matter of which we desire to speak in this lesson, and
that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of
speculation, although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such
speculation. We allude to the question which inevitably comes to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of all thinkers who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question
is: "WHY does THE ALL create Universes" The question <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be asked in
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> forms, but the above is the gist of the inquiry.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no
answer worthy of the name. Some have imagined that THE ALL had something
to gain by it, but this is absurd, for what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> THE ALL gain that it
did not already possess? <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span> have sought the answer in the idea that
THE ALL "wished something to love" and <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> that it created for
pleasure, or amusement; or because it "was lonely" or to manifest its
power;--all puerile explanations and ideas, belonging to the childish
period of thought.

<span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">Others</span> have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span>
itself "compelled" to create, by reason of its own "internal
nature"--its "creative instinct." This idea is in advance of the others,
but its weak point lies in the idea of THE ALL being "compelled" by
anything, internal or external. If its "internal nature," or "creative
instinct," compelled it to do anything, then the "internal nature" or
"creative instinct" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so
accordingly that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does
create and manifest, and seems to find some kind of satisfaction in so
doing. And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some
infinite degree it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> correspond to an "inner nature,"
or "creative instinct," in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and
Will. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not act unless it Willed to Act; and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not Will to
Act, unless it Desired to Act and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not Desire to Act unless it
obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> belong
to an "Inner Nature," and <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be postulated as existing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as
acting entirely FREE from any influence, internal as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as external.
That is the problem which lies at the root of difficulty--and the
difficulty that lies at the root of the problem.

Strictly speaking, there <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be any "Reason" whatsoever
for THE ALL to act, for a "reason" implies a "cause," and THE ALL is
above <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect, except when it Wills to <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> a Cause, at which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Principle is <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> into motion. So, you see, the matter is
Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> THE ALL
merely "IS"--so we are compelled to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT
ACTS." At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> in Itself;
All Action in Itself--and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is
Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act--or still further, that THE
ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same
thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> lessons,
the answer is locked up in the INNER <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">SELF</span> of THE ALL, along with its
Secret of Being. The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only
to that aspect of THE ALL, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be spoken of as "The Aspect of
BECOMING." Back of that Aspect is "The Aspect of BEING" in which all
Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE--and THE ALL;
PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">ONE</span> AND THE SAME. Therefore,
Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile. We go into the matter
here, merely to show that we recognize the question, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the
absurdity of the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology.

In conclusion, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be of interest to our students to learn that while
some of the ancient, and modern, Hermetic Teachers have rather inclined
in the direction of applying the Principle of Correspondence to the
question, with the result of the "Inner Nature" conclusion,--still the
legends have it that HERMES, the Great, when asked this question by his
advanced students, answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY <span class="t10 hoverable">TOGETHER</span>
and <span class="t0 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t14 t16 t18 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">saying</span> not a word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then,
he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: "The
lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding,"
believing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> his advanced students did not possess the
Understanding which entitled them to the Teaching. At any rate, if
Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to impart it, and so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is concerned THE LIPS OF HERMES ARE CLOSED regarding it. And where
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Hermes hesitated to speak, what mortal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> dare to teach?

But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if <span class="t1 t2 t6 hoverable">indeed</span>
there be an answer the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> remains that:  "While All is in THE ALL, it
is equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that THE ALL is in All." The Teaching on this point is
emphatic.

included in the Universe emanates from the same source, and the same

Philosophy considers that the Universe <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

    1. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Physical Plane.

These divisions are more or less artificial and arbitrary, for the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span>
is that all of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> divisions are but ascending degrees of the

do not allow us to enter into an extended discussion of, or explanation
of, the subject of these <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> planes, still we think it <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> to

At the beginning we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> consider the question so often asked by
the neophyte, who desires to be informed regarding the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Plane", which term has been very freely used, and very poorly
explained, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> recent <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the subject of occultism. The
question is generally about as follows: "Is a Plane a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> having
dimensions, or is it merely a condition or state?" We answer: "No, not a
place, nor ordinary dimension of space; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> more than a state or

state or condition is a degree of dimension, in a scale subject to
measurement." Somewhat paradoxical, is it not? But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us examine the
matter. A "dimension," you know, is "a measure in a straight line,
relating to measure," etc. The ordinary dimensions of space are length,
breadth, and height, or perhaps length, breadth, height, thickness or
circumference. But there is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> dimension of "created things" or

well, although the latter have not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> applied the term "dimension"
to it--and this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> dimension, which, by the way, is the <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> speculated
-about "Fourth Dimension," is the standard used in determining the
degrees or "planes."

This Fourth Dimension <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "The Dimension of Vibration" It is a
fact <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to modern science, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as to the Hermetists who have
embodied the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> in their "Third Hermetic Principle," that "everything

of matter, the unit of force, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of man, and the being of the arch

of the phenomena of the Universe which includes all that relates to
physics, or material things, forces, and manifestations. It includes all
forms of that which we call Matter, and all forms of that which we call
Energy or Force. But you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> remember that the Hermetic Philosophy does
not recognize Matter as a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> in itself, or as having a separate
existence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL. The Teachings are that Matter is
but a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of Energy--.that is, Energy at a low rate of vibrations of a
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> kind. And accordingly the Hermetists classify Matter under the
head of Energy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> to it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the Seven Minor Planes of the

These Seven Minor Physical Planes are as follows:

    1. The Plane of Matter (A)
    2. The Plane of Matter (B)
    3. The Plane of Matter (C)
    4. The Plane of Ethereal Substance
    5. The Plane of Energy (A)
    6. The Plane of Energy (B)
    7. The Plane of Energy (C)

The Plane of Matter (A) comprises the forms of Matter in its <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of
solids, liquids, and gases, as generally recognized by the text-books on
physics. The Plane of Matter (B) comprises <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and more
subtle forms of Matter of the existence of which modern science is but
now recognizing, the phenomena of Radiant Matter, in its phases of
radium, etc., belonging to the lower sub-division of this Minor Plane.
The Plane of Matter (C) comprises forms of the most subtle and tenuous
Matter, the existence of which is not suspected by ordinary scientists.
The Plane of Ethereal Substance comprises that which science speaks of
as "The Ether", a substance of extreme tenuity and elasticity, pervading
all Universal Space, and acting as a medium for the transmission of
waves of energy, such as light, heat, electricity, etc. This Ethereal
Substance forms a connecting link between Matter (so-called) and Energy,
and partakes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of each. The Hermetic Teachings, however,
instruct that this plane has seven sub-divisions (as have all of the
Minor Planes), and that in fact there are seven ethers, instead of but
one.

Next above the Plane of Ethereal Substance comes the Plane of Energy
(A), which comprises the ordinary forms of Energy <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to science, its
seven sub-planes being, respectively, Heat; Light; Magnetism;
Electricity, and Attraction (including Gravitation, Cohesion, Chemical
Affinity, etc.) and several other forms of energy indicated by
scientific experiments but not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> named or classified. The Plane of
Energy (B) comprises seven subplanes of <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms of energy not as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> discovered by science, but which have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Nature's Finer
Forces" and which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> into operation in manifestations of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>

The Plane of Energy (C) comprises seven sub-planes of energy so highly

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Mental Plane comprises those forms of "living things" <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to

except to the occultist. The classification of the Seven Minor Mental
Planes is more or less satisfactory and arbitrary (unless accompanied by
elaborate explanations which are foreign to the purpose of this
particular work), but we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> mention them.

units or entities, or groups and combinations of the same, which animate
the forms <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to us as "minerals, chemicals, etc." These entities <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span>
not be confounded with the molecules, atoms and corpuscles themselves,
the latter being merely the material bodies or forms of these entities,

units of "living energy" which comprise the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> sub-divisions of the

the possession of mind, soul, or life, to the mineral kingdom, but all
occultists recognize the existence of the same, and modern science is
rapidly moving forward to the point-of-view of the Hermetic, in this
respect. The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their "loves and
hates"; "likes and dislikes"; "attractions and repulsions". "affinities
and non-affinities," etc., and some of the more daring of modern
scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the desire and will,
emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of
men. We have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or space to argue this matter here. All occultists

scientific <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> for outside corroboration. There are the usual seven
sub-divisions to this plane.

The Plane of Elemental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> (A) comprises the state or condition, and
degree of mental and vital development of a class of entities unknown to
the average man, but recognized to occultists. They are invisible to the
ordinary senses of man, but, nevertheless, exist and play their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of
the Drama of the Universe. Their degree of <span class="t6 t13 hoverable">intelligence</span> is between that

entities of the plant kingdom on the other. There are seven subdivisions
to this plane, also.

The Plane of Plant Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the
states or conditions of the entities comprising the kingdoms of the
Plant World, the vital and mental phenomena of which is fairly <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span>

The Plane of Animal Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the
states and conditions of the entities, beings, or souls, animating the
animal forms of life, familiar to us all. It is not necessary to go into
details regarding this kingdom or plane of life, for the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is
as familiar to us as is our own.

The Plane of Elemental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> (C), in its seven sub-divisions, comprises

and in <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> combinations. The <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> forms are semi-human in

The Plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Human</span> Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises those

various grades, degrees, and divisions. In this connection, we wish to
point out the fact that the average <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of today occupies but the fourth

have crossed the borders of the Fifth Sub-Division. It has taken the
race millions of <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> to reach this stage, and it will <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> more

and beyond. But, remember, that there have been races before us which
have passed through these degrees, and then on to <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes. Our own
race is the fifth (with stragglers from the fourth) which has <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> foot

who have outstripped the masses, and who have passed on to the sixth and
seventh sub-division, and some few being still further on. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of

manifests in all, for there is a correspondence, harmony and agreement

VIBRATION

    "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything
    vibrates."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Third Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Vibration--embodies
the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that Motion is manifest in everything in the Universe--that
<span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> is at rest--that everything moves, vibrates, and circles. This
Hermetic Principle was recognized by some of the early Greek philosophers
who embodied it in their systems. But, then, for centuries it was lost
sight of by the thinkers outside of the Hermetic ranks. But in the
Nineteenth Century physical science re-discovered the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> and the
Twentieth Century scientific discoveries have added additional proof of
the correctness and <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> of this centuries-old Hermetic doctrine.

The Hermetic Teachings are that not only is everything in constant
movement and vibration, but that the "differences" between the various
manifestations of the universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> are due entirely to the varying
rate and mode of vibrations. Not only this, but that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> THE ALL, in
itself, manifests a constant vibration of such an infinite degree of
intensity and rapid motion that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be practically considered as at
rest, the teachers directing the attention of the students to the fact
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> on the physical plane a rapidly moving object (such as a
revolving wheel) seems to be at rest. The Teachings are to the effect
that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the Pole of Vibration, the other Pole being
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> extremely gross forms of Matter. Between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles are

Modern Science has proven that all that we call Matter and Energy are
but "modes of vibratory motion," and some of the more advanced
scientists are rapidly moving toward the positions of the occultists who
hold that the phenomena of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> are likewise modes of vibration or
motion. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> what science has to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> regarding the question of
vibrations in matter and energy.

In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, science teaches that all matter manifests, in some
degree, the vibrations arising from temperature or heat. Be an object
cold or hot--both being but degrees of the same things--it manifests
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> heat vibrations, and in that <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> is in motion and vibration.
Then all particles of Matter are in circular movement, from corpuscle to
suns. The planets revolve around suns, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of them turn on their
axes. The suns move around greater central points, and these are
believed to move around still greater, and so on, ad infinitum. The
molecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a
state of constant vibration and movement around each other and against
each other. The molecules are composed of Atoms, which, likewise, are in
a state of constant movement and vibration. The atoms are composed of
Corpuscles, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "electrons," "ions," etc., which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> are
in a state of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which
manifest a very rapid state and mode of vibration. And, so we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that
all forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic
Principle of Vibration.

And so it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that
Light, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion
connected in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with, and probably emanating from the Ether.
Science does not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> attempt to explain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the phenomena

the Hermetists have held and taught for ages past.

The Universal Ether, which is postulated by science <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
being understood clearly, is held by the Hermetists to be but a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span>
manifestation of that which is erroneously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> matter--that is to
say, Matter at a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of vibration--and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by them "The
Ethereal Substance." The Hermetists teach that this Ethereal Substance
is of extreme tenuity and elasticity, and pervades universal space,
serving as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such
as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc. The Teachings are that The
Ethereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory
energy <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as "Matter" on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hand, and "Energy or Force" on the
other; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that it manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and
mode, entirely its own.

Scientists have offered the illustration of a rapidly moving wheel, top,
or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration. The
illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a
low rate of speed--we will call this revolving <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> "the object" in
following out the illustration. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us suppose the object moving slowly.
It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.
The speed is gradually increased. In a few moments its movement becomes
so rapid that a deep growl or low <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be heard. Then as the rate is
increased the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> rises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in the musical scale. Then, the motion
being still further increased, the next <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> is distinguished.
Then, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> after another, all the notes of the musical scale appear,
rising <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> as the motion is increased. Finally when the
motions have reached a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> rate the final <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">note</span> perceptible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span>
ears is reached and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence
follows. No sound is heard from the revolving object, the rate of motion
being so high that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> ear <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> register the vibrations. Then
comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. Then after quite a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
the eye catches a glimpse of the object becoming a dull dark reddish
color. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter. Then as the
speed is increased, the red melts into an orange. Then the orange melts
into a yellow. Then follow, successively, the shades of green, blue,
indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of sped increases. Then the
violet shades away, and all color disappears, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> eye not
being able to register them. But there are invisible rays emanating from
the revolving object, the rays that are used in photographing, and other
subtle rays of light. Then begin to manifest the peculiar rays <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as
the "X Rays," etc., as the constitution of the object changes.
Electricity and Magnetism are emitted when the appropriate rate of
vibration is attained.

When the object reaches a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> rate of vibration its molecules
disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the original elements or
atoms. Then the atoms, following the Principle of Vibration, are
separated into the countless corpuscles of which they are composed. And
finally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the corpuscles disappear and the object <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Be
composed of The Ethereal Substance. Science does not dare to follow the
illustration further, but the Hermetists teach that if the vibrations be

then on Spiritward, until it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> finally re-enter THE ALL, which is

"object" <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> before the stage of Ethereal Substance was reached, but
otherwise the illustration is correct inasmuch as it shows the effect of
constantly increased rates and modes of vibration. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> be
remembered, in the above illustration, that at the stages at which the
"object" throws off vibrations of light, heat, etc., it is not actually
"resolved" into those forms of energy (which are <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the
scale), but simply that it reaches a degree of vibration in which those
forms of energy are liberated, in a degree, from the confining
influences of its molecules, atoms and corpuscles, as the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be.
These forms of energy, although <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale than matter,
are imprisoned and confined in the material combinations, by reason of
the energies manifesting through, and using material forms, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
becoming entangled and confined in their creations of material forms,
which, to an extent, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of all creations, the creating force
becoming involved in its creation.

But the Hermetic Teachings go <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> further than do those of modern
science. They teach that all manifestation of thought, emotion, reason,
will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by
vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect
the minds of other persons by "induction." This is the principle which
produces the phenomena of "telepathy"; mental influence, and other forms
of the action and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> over mind, with which the general public

POLARITY

    "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything
    has its pair of opposites; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> and unlike are the same;
    opposites are identical in nature, but <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in degree;

    <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be reconciled."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Fourth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Polarity embodies

The <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> paradoxes, which have ever perplexed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of
men, are explained by an understanding of this Principle. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has always
recognized something akin to this Principle, and has endeavored to
express it by such sayings, maxims and aphorisms as the following:
"Everything is and isn't, at the same time"; "all truths are but
half-truths"; "every <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is half-false"; "there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides to

The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter
of degree. It teaches that "the pairs of opposites <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be reconciled,"
and that "thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span>
in degree"; and that the "universal reconciliation of opposites" is
effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. The teachers
claim that illustrations of this Principle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be had on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> hand, and

showing that <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t9 t10 t12 t14 t17 t18 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> and Matter are but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of the same thing,
the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. They show
that THE ALL and The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> are the same, the difference being merely a

Then passing on to the Physical Plane, they illustrate the Principle by
showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences
being merely a matter of degrees. The thermometer shows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> degrees of

"heat." Between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> degrees of "heat" or "cold,"
call them either and you are equally correct. The <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> degrees
is always "warmer," while the lower is always "colder." There is no
absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on the
thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins. It is all a matter of
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> or lower vibrations. The very terms "high" and "low," which we
are compelled to use, are but poles of the same thing-the terms are
relative. So with "East and West"--travel around the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in an

starting point, and you return from that westward point. Travel <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span>
enough North, and you will find yourself traveling South, or vice versa.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Light</span> and Darkness are poles of the same thing, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> degrees

the terms. A <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> is "less good" than the <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale;
but that "less good" thing, in turn, is "more good" than the <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> next
below it--and so on, the "more or less" being regulated by the position
on the scale.

And so it is on the Mental Plane. "Love and. Hate" are generally
regarded as being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> diametrically opposed to each other; entirely
different; unreconcilable. But we apply the Principle of Polarity; we
find that there is no such <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as Absolute <span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> or Absolute Hate, as
distinguished from each other. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are merely terms applied to the

"more love," or "less hate," as we ascend the scale; and "more hate" or
"less love" as we descend this being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> no matter from what point,

is a middle point where "Like and Dislike" <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> so faint that it is
difficult to distinguish between them. Courage and Fear <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> under the

And it is this fact that enables the Hermetist to transmute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> mental

The student who is familiar with the processes by which the various
schools of Mental Science, etc., produce changes in the mental states of
those following their teachings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not readily understand the
principle underlying <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> of these changes. When, however, the Principle
of Polarity is once grasped, and it is seen that the mental changes are
occasioned by a change of polarity-a sliding along the same scale-the
hatter is readily understood. The change is not in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a

merely a change of degree in the same things, a vastly important
difference. For instance, borrowing an analogy from the Physical Plane,
it is impossible to change Heat into Sharpness, Loudness, Highness,
etc., but Heat <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> readily be transmuted into Cold, simply by lowering
the vibrations. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Hate and <span class="t15 hoverable">Love</span> are mutually transmutable;
so are Fear and Courage. But Fear <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> be transformed into Love, nor
can Courage be transmuted into Hate. The mental states belong to
innumerable classes, each class of which has its opposite poles, along
which transmutation is possible.

The student will readily recognize that in the mental states, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as
in the phenomena of the Physical Plane, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be classified

Vibration, the Positive pole seems to be of a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree than the
Negative, and readily dominates it. The tendency of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is in the
direction of the dominant activity of the Positive pole.

In addition to the changing of the poles of one's own mental states by
the operation of the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> of Polarization, the phenomena of Mental
Influence, in its manifold phases, shows us that the principle <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be

over that of another, of which so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> has been written and taught of
late years. When it is understood that Mental Induction is possible,
that is that mental states <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be produced by "induction" from others,

obtained. For instance, a person is "blue," melancholy and full of fear.
A mental scientist bringing his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> up to the desired vibration by

case, then produces a similar mental state in the other by induction,
the result being that the vibrations are raised and the person polarizes
toward the Positive <span class="t0 t4 t10 t12 t13 t20 hoverable">end</span> of the scale instead toward the Negative, and
his Fear and other negative emotions are transmuted to Courage and
similar positive mental states. A little study will show you that these
mental changes are nearly all along the line of Polarization, the change
being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of degree rather than of kind.

pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and a low-
tide; between the two-poles manifest on the physical, mental or
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t7 t11 t18 t25 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes. The Principle of rhythm is closely connected with the
Principle of Polarity described in the preceding chapter. Rhythm
manifests between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles established by the Principle of
Polarity. This does not mean, however, that the pendulum of Rhythm
swings to the extreme poles, for this rarely happens; in fact, it is
difficult to establish the extreme polar opposites in the majority of
cases. But the swing is ever "toward" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> pole and then the other.

There is always an action and reaction; an advance and a retreat; a
rising and a sinking; manifested in all of the airs and phenomena of the
Universe. Suns, worlds, men, animals, plants, minerals, forces, energy,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> and matter, yes, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> Spirit, manifests this Principle. The
Principle manifests in the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and destruction of worlds; in the
rise and fall of nations; in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> history of all things; and finally
in the mental states of Man.

Beginning with the manifestations of Spirit--of THE ALL--it will be
noticed that there is ever the Outpouring and the Indrawing; the
"Outbreathing and Inbreathing of Brahm," as the Brahmans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> it.
Universes are created; reach their extreme low point of materiality; and
then begin in their upward swing. Suns spring into being, and then their
height of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> being reached, the process of retrogression begins, and
after aeons they <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> dead masses of matter, awaiting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> impulse
which starts again their inner energies into activity and a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> solar

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is with all the worlds; they are born,
grow and die; only to be reborn. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is with all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of
shape and form; they swing from action to reaction; from birth to death;
from activity to inactivity--and then back again. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is with all
living things; they are born, grow, and die--and then are reborn. So it
is with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> movements, philosophies, creeds, fashions,
governments, nations, and all else-birth, growth, maturity, decadence,
death-and then new-birth. The swing of the pendulum is ever in evidence.

Night follows day; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> night. The pendulum swings from Summer to
Winter, and then back again. The corpuscles, atoms, molecules, and all
masses of matter, swing around the circle of their nature. There is no
such <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as absolute rest, or cessation from movement, and all
movement partakes of rhythm. The principle is of universal application.
It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be applied to any question, or phenomena of any of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
planes of life. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be applied to all phases of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">human</span> activity.
There is always the Rhythmic swing from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> pole to the other. The
Universal Pendulum is ever in motion. The Tides of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> flow in and out,

The Principle of rhythm is <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> understood by modern science, and is
considered a universal <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> as applied to material things. But the
Hermetists carry the principle <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> further, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> that its
manifestations and influence extend to the mental activities of Man, and
that it accounts for the bewildering succession of moods, feelings and
other annoying and perplexing changes that we notice in ourselves. But
the Hermetists by studying the operations of this Principle have learned
to escape some of its activities by Transmutation.

The Hermetic Masters <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">since</span> discovered that while the Principle of
Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still
there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> planes of its manifestation so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as mental phenomena
are concerned. They discovered that there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> general planes of
Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact
enabled them to rise to the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> escape the swing of
the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other
words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and
the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of
Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above
the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the
negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> and
letting it <span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student,
polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to
"refusing" to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a
"denial" of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized
position, and allows the mental pendulum to swing back along the
unconscious plane. All individuals who have attained any degree of self-
mastery, accomplish this, more or less unknowingly, and by refusing to
allow their moods and negative mental states to affect them, they apply
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Neutralization. The Master, however, carries this to a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span>
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of proficiency, and by the use of his Will he attains
a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of those who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by
the mental pendulum of moods and feelings.

The importance of this will be appreciated by any thinking person who
realizes what creatures of moods, feelings and emotion the majority of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are, and how little mastery of themselves they manifest. If you
will stop and consider a moment, you will realize how <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> these swings
of Rhythm have affected you in your life--how a period of Enthusiasm has
been invariably followed by an opposite feeling and mood of Depression.
Likewise, your moods and periods of Courage have been succeeded by equal
moods of Fear. And so it has ever been with the majority of
persons--tides of feeling have ever risen and fallen with them, but they
have <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> suspected the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> or reason of the mental phenomena. An
understanding of the workings of this Principle will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> the key to
the Mastery of these rhythmic swings of feeling, and will enable him to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">know</span> himself better and to avoid being carried <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> by these inflows and
outflows. The Will is superior to the conscious manifestation of this
Principle, although the Principle itself can <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> be destroyed. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
escape its effects, but the Principle operates, nevertheless. The
pendulum ever swings, although we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> escape being carried along with
it.

There are other features of the operation of this Principle of Rhythm of
which we wish to speak at this point. There comes into its operations
that which is <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> as the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of the definitions
or meanings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Compensate" is, "to counterbalance" which is
the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which the Hermetists use the term. It is this <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of
Compensation to which the Kybalion refers when it says: "The measure of
the swing to the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm
compensates."

The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation is that the swing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> direction determines
the swing in the opposite direction, or to the opposite pole-the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
balances, or counterbalances, the other. On the Physical Plane we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> examples of this Law. The pendulum of the clock swings a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span>
distance to the right, and then an equal distance to the left. The
seasons balance each other in the same way. The tides follow the same
Law. And the same <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> is manifested in all the phenomena of Rhythm. The
pendulum, with a short swing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> direction, has but a short swing in
the other; while the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> swing to the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> invariably <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span>
swing to the left.  An object hurled upward to a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> height has an
equal distance to traverse on its return. The force with which a
projectile is sent upward a mile is reproduced when the projectile
returns to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> on its return journey. This <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> is constant on the
Physical Plane, as reference to the standard authorities will show you.

But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man's
mental states are subject to the same Law. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who enjoys keenly, is
subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable
of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and
enjoys but little--he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are
other animals who enjoy keenly, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">whose</span> nervous organism and
temperament <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">cause</span> them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is
with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of
enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>
which permit the most intense enjoyment, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the most intense
suffering. The rule is that the capacity for pain and pleasure, in each
individual, are balanced. The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation is in full operation
here.

But the Hermetists go still further in this matter. They teach that
before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is able to enjoy a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> degree of pleasure, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> have
swung as far, proportionately, toward the other pole of feeling. They
hold, however, that the Negative is precedent to the Positive in this
matter, that is to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that in experiencing a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> degree of pleasure
it does not follow that he will have to "pay up for it" with a
corresponding degree of pain; on the contrary, the pleasure is the
Rhythmic swing, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation, for a degree of
pain previously experienced either in the <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> life, or in a previous
incarnation. This throws a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> on the Problem of Pain.

The Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect underlies all scientific thought,
ancient and modern, and was enunciated by the Hermetic Teachers in the
earliest days. While <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> and varied disputes between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> schools

the details of the operations of the Principle, and still more often
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> words. The underlying Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and
Effect has been accepted as correct by practically all the thinkers of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> worthy of the name. To think otherwise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> the
phenomena of the universe from the domain of <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> and Order, and to
relegate it; to the control of the imaginary something which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have

A little consideration will show anyone that there is in reality no such
<span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as pure chance. Webster defines the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Chance" as follows: "A
supposed agent or mode of activity other than a force, <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> or purpose;
the operation or activity of such agent; the supposed effect of such an
agent; a happening; fortuity; casualty, etc." But a little consideration
will show you that there can be no such agent as "Chance," in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span>
of something outside of Law-something outside of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect. How
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> there be a something acting in the phenomenal universe,
independent of the laws, order, and continuity of the latter? Such a
something <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be entirely independent of the orderly trend of the
universe, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> superior to it. We can imagine <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span> outside
of THE ALL being outside of the Law, and that only because THE ALL is
the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">LAW</span> in itself. There is no room in the universe for a something
outside of and independent of Law. The existence of such a Something
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> render all Natural Laws ineffective, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> plunge the universe
into chaotic disorder and lawlessness.

A careful examination will show that what we call "Chance" is merely an
expression relating to obscure causes; causes that we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> perceive;
causes that we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">cannot</span> understand.

<span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">Meaning</span> "to fall" (as the falling of dice), the idea being that the fall

unrelated to any cause. And this is the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> in which the term is
generally employed. But when the matter is closely examined, it is seen
that there is no chance whatsoever about the fall of the dice. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
a die falls, and displays a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> number, it obeys a <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> as infallible
as that which governs the revolution of the planets around the sun. Back
of the fall of the die are causes, or chains of causes, running back
further than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> can follow. The position of the die in the box;
the amount of muscular energy expended in the throw; the condition of
the table, etc., etc., all are causes, the effect of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be seen.
But back of these seen causes there are chains of unseen preceding
causes, all of which had a bearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the number of the die which fell

numbers shown will be about equal, that is, there will be an equal
number of one-spot, two-spot, etc., coming uppermost. Toss a penny in

This is the operation of the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> of average. But both the average and
the single toss <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> under the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect, and if we were

please." What makes them "want to" do <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> in preference to

GENDER

    "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine
    and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all
    planes."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Seventh Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Gender-embodies
the <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> that there is Gender manifested in everything-that the
Masculine and Feminine principles are ever <span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> and active in all
phases of phenomena, on each and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> plane of life. At this point we
think it <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> to call your attention to the fact that Gender, in its
Hermetic sense, and Sex in the ordinarily accepted use of the term, are
not the same.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Gender" is derived from the Latin root <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> "to beget; to
procreate; to generate; to create; to produce." A moment's consideration
will show you that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> has a <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> broader and more general <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span>
than the term "Sex," the latter referring to the physical distinctions
between male and female living things. Sex is merely a manifestation of
Gender on a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> plane of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Physical Plane--the plane of
organic life. We wish to impress this distinction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> your minds, for
the reason that <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> writers, who have acquired a smattering of the
Hermetic Philosophy, have sought to identify this Seventh Hermetic
Principle with wild and fanciful, and often reprehensible, theories and
teachings regarding Sex.

The office of Gender is solely that of creating, producing, generating,
etc., and its manifestations are visible on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> plane of phenomena. It
is somewhat difficult to produce proofs of this along scientific lines,
for the reason that science has not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> recognized this Principle as
of universal application. But still some proofs are forthcoming from
scientific sources. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> place, we find a distinct manifestation
of the Principle of Gender <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the corpuscles, ions, or electrons,
which constitute the basis of Matter as science now knows the latter,
and which by forming <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> combinations <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> the Atom, which until
lately was regarded as final and indivisible.

The latest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of science is that the atom is composed of a multitude
of corpuscles, electrons, or ions (the various names being applied by
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> authorities) revolving around each other and vibrating at a
high degree and intensity. But the accompanying statement is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> that
the formation of the atom is really due to the clustering of negative
corpuscles around a positive one---the positive corpuscles seeming to
exert a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the negative corpuscles, causing the
latter to assume <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> combinations and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> "create" or "generate" an
atom. This is in line with the most ancient Hermetic Teachings, which
have always identified the Masculine principle of Gender with the
"Positive," and the Feminine with the "Negative" Poles of Electricity
(so called).

Now a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> at this point regarding this identification. The public <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span>
has formed an entirely erroneous impression regarding the qualities of
the so-called "Negative" pole of electrified or magnetized Matter. The
terms Positive and Negative are very wrongly applied to this phenomenon
by science. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Positive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t13 t15 t16 t19 t22 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">means</span> something real and strong, as
compared with a Negative unreality or weakness. <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">Nothing</span> is further from
the real facts of electrical phenomenon. The so-called Negative pole of
the battery is really the pole in and by which the generation or
production of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> forms and energies is manifested. There is <span class="t6 t18 t19 hoverable">nothing</span>
"negative" about it. The best scientific authorities now use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
"Cathode" in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of "Negative," the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Cathode coming from the Greek
root <span class="t2 t10 t13 t16 t17 t19 hoverable">meaning</span> "descent; the path of generation, etc," From the Cathode
pole emerge the swarm of electrons or corpuscles; from the same pole
emerge those wonderful "rays" which have revolutionized scientific
conceptions during the past decade. The Cathode pole is the Mother of
all of the strange phenomena which have rendered useless the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span>
textbooks, and which have caused <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> accepted theories to be
relegated to the scrap-pile of scientific speculation. The Cathode, or
Negative Pole, is the Mother Principle of Electrical Phenomena, and of
the finest forms of matter as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to science. So you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> we are
justified in refusing to use the term "Negative" in our consideration of
the subject, and in insisting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> substituting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Feminine" for
the <span class="t20 hoverable">old</span> term. The facts of the <span class="t4 hoverable">case</span> bear us out in this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> taking
the Hermetic Teachings into consideration. And so we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> use the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
"Feminine" in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of "Negative" in speaking of that pole of
activity.

The latest scientific teachings are that the creative corpuscles or
electrons are Feminine (science <span class="t0 t1 t4 t6 t11 t13 t14 t26 hoverable">says</span> "they are composed of negative
electricity"-we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> they are composed of Feminine energy). A Feminine
corpuscle becomes detached from, or rather leaves, a Masculine
corpuscle, and starts on a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> career. It actively seeks a union with a
Masculine corpuscle, being urged thereto by the natural impulse to
create <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> forms of Matter or Energy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> writer goes so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> as to use
the term "it at once seeks, of its own volition, a union," etc. This
detachment and uniting <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> the basis of the greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the
activities of the chemical world. When the Feminine corpuscle unites
with a Masculine corpuscle, a <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> process is begun. The Feminine
particles vibrate rapidly under the influence of the Masculine energy,
and circle rapidly around the latter. The result is the birth of a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span>
atom. This <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> atom is really composed of a union of the Masculine and
Feminine electrons, or corpuscles, but when the union is formed the atom
is a separate thing, having <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> properties, but no longer
manifesting the property of free electricity. The process of detachment
or separation of the Feminine electrons is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "ionization." These
electrons, or corpuscles, are the most active workers in Nature's field.
Arising from their unions, or combinations, manifest the varied
phenomena of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, attraction,
repulsion, chemical affinity and the reverse, and similar phenomena. And
all this arises from the operation of the Principle of Gender on the
plane of Energy.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Masculine principle seems to be that of directing a
<span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> inherent energy toward the Feminine principle, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> starting
into activity the creative processes. But the Feminine principle is the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> always doing the active creative work-and this is so on all planes.
And yet, each principle is incapable of operative energy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
assistance of the other. In some of the forms of life, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
principles are combined in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> organism. For that matter, everything in
the organic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> manifests both genders--there is always the Masculine
<span class="t12 hoverable">present</span> in the Feminine form, and the Feminine form.  The Hermetic
Teachings include <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> regarding the operation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principles of
Gender in the production and manifestation of various forms of energy,
etc., but we do not deem it expedient to go into detail regarding the
same at this point, because we are unable to back up the same with
scientific proof, for the reason that science has not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> progressed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far. But the example we have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> you of the phenomena of the
electrons or corpuscles will show you that science is on the <span class="t7 t20 t22 hoverable">right</span> path,
and will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you a general idea of the underlying principles.

Some leading scientific investigators have announced their belief that
in the formation of crystals there was to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> something that
corresponded to "sex-activity" which is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> straw showing the
direction the scientific winds are blowing. And each year will <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span>
other facts to corroborate the correctness of the Hermetic Principle of
Gender. It will be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> that Gender is in constant operation and
manifestation in the field of inorganic matter, and in the field of
Energy or Force. Electricity is now generally regarded as the
"Something" into which all other forms of energy seem to melt or
dissolve. The "Electrical Theory of the Universe" is the latest
scientific doctrine, and is growing rapidly in popularity and
general acceptance. And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> follows that if we are able to discover
in the phenomena of electricity-even at the very root and source of its
manifestations a clear and unmistakable evidence of the presence of
Gender and its activities, we are justified in asking you to believe
that science at last has offered proofs of the existence in all
universal phenomena of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hermetic Principle-the Principle of
Gender.

It is not necessary to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">take</span> up your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> phenomena
of the "attraction and repulsion" of the atoms; chemical affinity; the
"loves and hates" of the atomic particles; the attraction or cohesion

<span class="t11 t13 t26 hoverable">CHAPTER</span> XIV

MENTAL GENDER

Students of psychology who have followed the modern trend of <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span>
along the lines of mental phenomena are struck by the persistence of the
dual-mind idea which has manifested itself so strongly during the past
ten or fifteen years, and which has <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> rise to a number of plausible
theories regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and constitution of these "two minds." The
late Thomson J. Hudson attained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> popularity in 1893 by advancing
his well-known theory of the "objective and subjective minds" which he
held existed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> individual. Other writers have attracted almost
equal attention by the theories regarding the "conscious and
subconscious minds"; the "voluntary and involuntary minds"; "the active
and passive minds," etc., etc. The theories of the various writers
differ from each other, but there remains the underlying principle of
"the duality of mind."

The student of the Hermetic Philosophy is tempted to smile when he reads
and hears of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> "new theories" regarding the duality of mind,
each school adhering tenaciously to its own pet theories, and each
claiming to have "discovered the truth." The student turns back the
pages of occult history, and <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">away</span> back in the dim beginnings of occult
teachings he finds references to the ancient Hermetic doctrine of the
Principle of Gender on the Mental Plane-the manifestation of Mental
Gender. And examining further he finds that the ancient philosophy took
cognizance of the phenomenon of the "dual mind," and accounted for it by
the theory of Mental Gender. This idea of Mental Gender <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be explained
in a few <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span> to students who are familiar with the modern theories
just alluded to. The Masculine Principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> corresponds to the
so-called Objective Mind; Conscious Mind; Voluntary Mind; Active Mind,
etc. And the Feminine Principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">Mind</span> corresponds to the so-called
Subjective Mind; Sub-conscious Mind; Involuntary Mind; Passive Mind,
etc. Of course the Hermetic Teachings do not agree with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> modern
theories regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> phases of mind, nor does it

standing the test of experiment and demonstration.  We point to the
phases of agreement merely for the purpose of helping the student to
assimilate his previously acquired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with the teachings of the
Hermetic Philosophy. Students of Hudson will notice the statement at the
beginning of his second <span class="t11 t13 t26 hoverable">chapter</span> of "The <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of Psychic Phenomena," that:
"The mystic jargon of the Hermetic philosophers discloses the same
general idea" i.e., the duality of mind. If Dr. Hudson had taken

regarding Mental Gender.

The Hermetic Teachers impart their instruction regarding this subject by
bidding their students examine the report of their consciousness
regarding their Self. The students are bidden to turn their attention
inward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Self</span> dwelling <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> each.

Self-the report is "I Am." This at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> seems to be the final <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">words</span>
from the consciousness, but a little further examination discloses the
fact that this "I Am" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be separated or split into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct parts,

them to be practically "a something belonging to" their body-which in

But as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> rises in the scale of consciousness he is able to disentangle

identify the "Me" entirely with the mental states, feelings, etc., which
he feels to exist <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> him. He is very apt to consider these internal
states as identical with himself, instead of their being simply "things"
produced by some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of his mentality, and existing <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> him--of him,
and in him, but still not "himself." He sees that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> change these
internal states of feelings by all effort of will, and that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span>
produce a feeling or state of an exactly opposite nature, in the same
way, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the same "Me" exists. And so after a while he is able to
<span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> aside these various mental states, emotions, feelings, habits,
qualities, characteristics, and other personal mental belongings--he is
able to <span class="t7 t13 t14 t15 t18 t23 t28 hoverable">set</span> them aside in the "not-me" collection of curiosities and
encumbrances, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as valuable possessions. This requires <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> mental
concentration and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of mental analysis on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the student.
But still the task is possible for the advanced student, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> those
not so <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> advanced are able to see, in the imagination, how the process
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be performed.

After this laying-aside process has been performed, the student will
find himself in conscious possession of a "Self" which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be considered
in its "I" and "Me" dual aspects. The "Me" will be felt to be a
Something mental in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and other
mental states <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be produced. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be considered as the "mental
womb," as the ancients styled it-capable of generating mental offspring.
It reports to the consciousness as a "Me" with latent powers of <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span>
and generation of mental progeny of all sorts and kinds. Its powers of
creative energy are felt to be enormous. But still it seems to be
conscious that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">must</span> receive some <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> of energy from either its "I"
companion, or else from some other "I" ere it is able to <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">bring</span> into
being its mental creations. This consciousness brings with it a
realization of an enormous capacity for mental <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and creative
ability.

But the student soon finds that this is not all that he finds <span class="t4 t7 t10 t13 hoverable">within</span> his
inner consciousness. He finds that there exists a mental Something which
is able to Will that the "Me" act along <span class="t2 t22 hoverable">certain</span> creative lines, and
which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> able to stand aside and witness the mental creation. This
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of himself he is taught to call his "I." He is able to rest in its
consciousness at will. He finds there not a consciousness of an ability
to generate and actively create, in the <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> of the gradual process
attendant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> mental operations, but rather a <span class="t26 hoverable">sense</span> and consciousness
of an ability to project an energy from the "I" to the "Me"--a process
of "willing" that the mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> begin and proceed. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> finds
that the "I" is able to stand aside and witness the operations of the
"Me's" mental <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> and generation. There is this dual aspect in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> person. The "I" represents the Masculine Principle of
Mental Gender-the "Me" represents the Female Principle. The "I"
represents the Aspect of Being; the "Me" the Aspect of Becoming. You
will notice that the Principle of Correspondence operates on this plane
just as it does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of
Universes is performed. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are similar in kind, although
vastly <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t10 t13 t23 hoverable">different</span> in degree. "As above, so below; as below, so above."

These aspects of mind-the Masculine and Feminine Principles-the "I" and
the "Me"-considered in connection with the well-known mental and psychic
phenomena, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the master-key to these dimly <span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> regions of mental
operation and manifestation. The principle of Mental Gender gives the
<span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> underlying the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t11 t16 t17 t22 t23 hoverable">whole</span> field of the phenomena of mental influence,
etc.

The tendency of the Feminine Principle is always in the direction of
receiving impressions, while the tendency of the Masculine Principle is
always in the direction of giving, out or expressing. The Feminine
Principle has <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> more varied field of operation than has the Masculine
Principle. The Feminine Principle conducts the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of generating <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span>
thoughts, concepts, ideas, including the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the imagination. The
Masculine Principle contents itself with the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the "Will" in its
varied phases. And yet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the active aid of the Will of the
Masculine Principle, the Feminine Principle is apt to rest content with
generating mental images which are the result of impressions received
from outside, instead of producing original mental creations.

Persons who can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> continued attention and <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">thought</span> to a subject
actively employ both of the Mental Principles-the Feminine in the <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of the mental generation, and the Masculine Will in stimulating and
energizing the creative portion of the mind. The majority of persons
really employ the Masculine Principle but little, and are content to
live <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the thoughts and ideas instilled into the "Me" from
the "I" of other minds. But it is not our purpose to dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this
phase of the subject, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be studied from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> text-book <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
psychology, with the key that we have <span class="t0 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> you regarding Mental Gender.

The student of Psychic Phenomena is aware of the wonderful phenomena
classified under the head of Telepathy; <span class="t18 t25 hoverable">Thought</span> Transference; Mental
Influence; Suggestion; Hypnotism, etc. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> have sought for an
explanation of these varied phases of phenomena under the theories of
the various "dual mind" teachers. And in a measure they are right, for
there is clearly a manifestation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct phases of mental
activity. But if such students will consider these "dual minds" in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">light</span> of the Hermetic Teachings regarding Vibrations and Mental Gender,
they will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t17 t23 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">long</span> sought for key is at hand.

In the phenomena of Telepathy it is seen how the Vibratory Energy of the
Masculine Principle is projected toward the Feminine Principle of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> person, and the latter takes the seed-thought and allows it to
develop into maturity. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Suggestion and Hypnotism
operates. The Masculine Principle of the person giving the suggestions
directs a stream of Vibratory Energy or Will-Power toward the Feminine
Principle of the other person, and the latter accepting it makes it its
own and acts and thinks accordingly. An idea <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lodged in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> of
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> person grows and develops, and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is regarded as the
rightful mental offspring of the individual, whereas it is in reality
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the cuckoo egg placed in the sparrows nest, where it destroys the
rightful offspring and makes itself at home. The normal method is for
the Masculine and Feminine Principles in a person's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> to co-ordinate
and act harmoniously in conjunction with each other, but, unfortunately,
the Masculine Principle in the average person is too lazy to act-the
display of Will-Power is too slight-and the consequence is that such
persons are ruled almost entirely by the minds and wills of other
persons, whom they allow to do their thinking and willing for them.
How few original thoughts or original actions are performed by the
average person? Are not the majority of persons mere shadows and echoes
of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> having stronger wills or minds than themselves? The trouble is
that the average person dwells almost altogether in his "Me"
consciousness and does not realize that he has such a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> as an "I."
He is polarized in his Feminine Principle of Mind, and the Masculine
Principle, in which is lodged the Will, is allowed to remain inactive
and not employed.

The strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> invariably manifest the Masculine
Principle of Will, and their strength depends materially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this fact.
Instead of living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the impressions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their minds by others,
they dominate their own minds by their Will, obtaining the kind of
mental images desired, and moreover dominate the minds of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span>
likewise, in the same manner. Look at the strong people, how they manage
to implant their seed-thoughts in the minds of the masses of the people,

are such sheeplike creatures, <span class="t12 hoverable">never</span> originating an idea of their own,
nor using their own powers of mental activity.

The manifestation of Mental Gender <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be noticed all around us in

The actor who makes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> weep or cry as he wills, is employing this
principle. And so is the successful orator, statesman, preacher, writer
or other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are before the public attention. The peculiar

of Mental Gender, along the Vibrational lines above indicated. In this
principle lies the secret of personal magnetism, personal influence,
fascination, etc., as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the phenomena generally grouped under the

The student who has familiarized himself with the phenomena generally
spoken of as "psychic" will have discovered the important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> played in

Suggestion is necessary in <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">order</span> to intelligently comprehend the varied
psychical phenomena which Suggestion underlies. But, still more is a

principle of Mental Gender and Vibration.

It is customary for the writers and teachers of Suggestion to explain
that it is the "objective or voluntary" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 hoverable">mind</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the mental

show that the very <span class="t6 t20 t24 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe follows the same law, and

the mental, and the physical, there is always in operation this
principle of Gender-this manifestation of the Masculine and the Feminine
Principles. "As above, so below; as below, so above." And more than
this, when the principle of Mental Gender is once grasped and
understood, the varied phenomena of psychology at once becomes capable
of intelligent classification and study, instead of being very <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> in

    "To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration,
    <span class="t5 t15 t16 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">put</span> into operation the principle of Polarity and
    concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the opposite pole to that which
    you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by
    changing its polarity."--The Kybalion.

This is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the most important of the Hermetic Formulas. It is based

We have shown you that a mental state
and its opposite were merely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> thing, and that by
Mental Transmutation the polarity <span class="t1 t2 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">might</span> be reversed. This Principle is
<span class="t2 hoverable">known</span> to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of
undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> trying
to "kill out" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and
the Fear will disappear. Some writers have expressed this idea most
forcibly by using the illustration of the dark room. You do not have to
shovel out or sweep out the Darkness, but by merely opening the shutters
and letting in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Light</span> the Darkness has disappeared. To kill out a
Negative quality, concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Positive Pole of that same
quality, and the vibrations will gradually change from Negative to
Positive, until finally you will <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> polarized on the
Positive pole instead of the Negative. The reverse is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> true, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
have <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> out to their sorrow, when they have allowed themselves to

your disposition, and build up character. <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">Much</span> of the Mental Mastery of
the advanced Hermetics is due to this application of Polarity, which is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the important aspects of Mental Transmutation. Remember the
Hermetic Axiom (quoted previously), which says:

    "Mind (as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as metals and elements) <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be transmuted
    from state to state; degree to degree, condition to
    condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration."--The Kybalion.

The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles
of Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> acquires the
<span class="t9 t21 hoverable">art</span> of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his
environment. An understanding of this principle will enable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to
change his own Polarity, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as that of others, if he will but
devote the time, care, study and practice necessary to master the art.
The principle is true, but the results obtained depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
persistent patience and practice of the student.

    "Rhythm <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be neutralized by an application of the <span class="t9 t21 hoverable">Art</span>
    of Polarization."--The Kybalion.

As we have explained in previous chapters, the Hermetists hold that the
Principle of Rhythm manifests on the Mental Plane as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as on the
Physical Plane, and that the bewildering succession of moods, feelings,
emotions, and other mental states, are due to the backward and forward
swing of the mental pendulum, which carries us from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> extreme of
feeling to the other. The Hermetists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> teach that the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">Law</span> of
Neutralization enables one, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent, to overcome the operation
of Rhythm in consciousness. As we have explained, there is a <span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span>
Plane of Consciousness, as <span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the ordinary Lower Plane, and the
Master by rising mentally to the <span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Plane causes the swing of the
mental pendulum to manifest on the Lower Plane, and he, dwelling on his
<span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Plane, escapes the consciousness of the swing backward. This is
effected by polarizing on the <span class="t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Self, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> raising the mental
vibrations of the Ego above those of the ordinary plane of
consciousness. It is akin to rising above a <span class="t4 hoverable">thing</span> and allowing it to
<span class="t11 hoverable">pass</span> beneath you. The advanced Hermetist polarizes himself at the
Positive Pole of his Being-the "I Am" pole rather than the pole of
personality and by "refusing" and "denying" the operation of Rhythm,
raises himself above its plane of consciousness, and standing firm in
his Statement of Being he allows the pendulum to swing back on the Lower
Plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> changing his Polarity. This is accomplished by all
individuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, whether
they understand the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> or not. Such persons simply "refuse" to allow
themselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by
steadfastly affirming the superiority they remain polarized on the
Positive pole. The Master, of course, attains a <span class="t0 t2 t4 t8 t20 t26 hoverable">far</span> greater degree of
proficiency, because he understands the <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> which he is overcoming by a
<span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> law, and by the use of his Will he attains a degree of Poise and
Mental Steadfastness almost impossible of belief on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of those
who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by the mental
pendulum of moods and feelings.

Remember always, however, that you do not really destroy the Principle
of Rhythm, for that is indestructible. You simply overcome <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t8 t9 t11 t16 t22 t28 hoverable">law</span> by
counter-balancing it with <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">another</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> maintain an equilibrium. The
laws of balance and counter-balance are in operation on the mental as
<span class="t0 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as on the physical planes, and an understanding of these laws
enables <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to seem to overthrow laws, whereas he is merely exerting a
counterbalance.

    "Nothing escapes the Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect,
    but there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> Planes of Causation, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> use
    the laws of the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> to overcome the laws of the
    lower."--The Kybalion.

By an understanding of the practice of Polarization, the Hermetists rise
to a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of Causation and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> counter-balance the laws of the
lower planes of Causation. By rising above the plane of ordinary Causes
they <span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> themselves, in a degree, Causes instead of being merely
Caused. By being able to master their own moods and feelings, and by
being able to neutralize Rhythm, as we have already explained, they are
able to escape a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the operations of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect on the
ordinary plane. The masses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are carried along, obedient to
their environment; the wills and desires of <span class="t3 t10 t23 hoverable">others</span> stronger than
themselves; the effects of inherited tendencies; the suggestions of
those about them; and other outward causes; which tend to move them
about on the chess-board of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> mere pawns. By rising above these
influencing causes, the advanced Hermetists seek a <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of
mental action, and by dominating their moods, emotions, impulses and
feelings, they create for themselves <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">new</span> characters, qualities and
powers, by which they overcome their ordinary environment, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
<span class="t12 hoverable">become</span> practically players instead of mere Pawns. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> help to

They use
the Principle of <span class="t1 t3 t4 t9 t10 hoverable">Cause</span> and Effect, instead of being used by
it. Of course, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t15 t28 hoverable">highest</span> are subject to the Principle as it
manifests on the <span class="t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes, but on the lower planes of activity,
they are Masters instead of Slaves. As The Kybalion says:

    "The wise ones serve on the higher, but rule on the lower.
    They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their
    own plane, and those below them they rule and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> orders.
    And, yet, in so doing, they <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t12 t16 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">form</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Principle,
    instead of opposing it. The wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> falls in with the Law,
    and by understanding its movements he operates it instead
    of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer
    turn this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and that way, going and coming as he will,
    instead of being as the log which is carried here and
    there--so is the wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as compared to the ordinary

    the road to Mastery."--The Kybalion.

In conclusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us again call your attention to the Hermetic Axiom:

    "True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art."--The Kybalion.

In the above axiom, the Hermetists teach that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t20 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
influencing one's environment is accomplished by Mental Power. The
Universe being wholly mental, it follows that it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be ruled only by
Mentality. And in this <span class="t1 t3 t7 t12 t14 t16 t26 t28 hoverable">truth</span> is to be <span class="t0 t16 t19 t24 hoverable">found</span> an explanation of all the
phenomena and manifestations of the various mental powers which are
attracting so <span class="t0 t3 t7 t11 t12 t18 t24 t25 t28 hoverable">much</span> attention and study in these earlier <span class="t1 t3 t6 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of the
Twentieth Century. Back of and under the teachings of the various cults

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic <span class="t0 t6 t7 t25 t28 hoverable">works</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
