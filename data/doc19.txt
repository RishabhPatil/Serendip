In the mound of Kouyunjik, opposite the town of

Mosul, Mr. Layard discovered part of the Royal

Assyrian library, and further collections, also forming

In these references to the names of the living

made by the Creator at the beginning of

in Genesis ii. 19., where we read that "out of the
ground <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> formed every beast of the field and

:

and whatsoever

Ad:mi railed every living creature, that was the

name thereof."
One of the most curious statements made in these
hymns is that the race of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> by the deity

Smith's
Assyrian Discoveries," p. 176. In some
portions of these fragments there are references to

the story of

Khumbaba, but

as the fragment appears

IZDUBAR.
to refer to the illness of Izdubar

253
it

probably belongs

here.

The name of Sargon signifies the right, true, or legitimate king, and may have been assumed on his

Sargon was probably of obscure origin, arid hence the myth that attached itself
to

him

in later popular belief.
