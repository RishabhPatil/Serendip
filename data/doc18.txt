PREFACE
By PERITUS
The Jesuits are different. Every Catholic Priest knows this. The Jesuits have an
uncanny manner financially. Operating behind the scenes, they seem very inconspicuous,
but when the wills of rich Catholics, and very many non-Catholics, are filed for probate.
strangely some Jesuit institution is there for a sizable amount.
They are so different in their priestly deportment and social conduct too, that other
priests feel ill at ease and uncomfortable in their presence. A priestly "blast" never really
gets organized until after the Jesuits have gone home. The prevailing atmosphere, when
they are present, is one of uneasy suspicion. Other priests feel as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the "Jebbies" will

ridiculous because most bishops are just as leery of the Jesuits as are the working clergy.
Lay <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> also think that Jesuits are different. They <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> as
the "educated clergy,"-the "teaching arm of the church". They have the "most
schools"-which is true. The quality of those schools is another question. None of them, at
least in the U.S. has ever won an award for the volume of scientists or philosophers it
produced. Voltaire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">went</span> to a Jesuit school. He said later that he learned Latin and
nonsense.

The Jesuits write the most books-which is also true. In <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> it is said that any Jesuit
who can pen one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> after another seems forced "under obedience" to write a book.
Judging by a perusal of them, the subject <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> or the treatment seems of very little
consequence.

The laity are told that the Jesuits are smarter than other priests because they go to
school longer. The laity do not realize that for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> those Jesuits are in their schools
not as students, but as teachers-callow, young, inexperienced boys carrying on the "great
tradition" of Jesuit education.
The laity, Catholic and non-Catholic, are also told that the Jesuits are much more
selective in their choice of candidates than other orders or diocesan seminaries. They pick
only the smarter and more promising youngsters and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> insure a continuing crop of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
scholars, teachers, philosophers, orators and, not mentioned, ecclesiastical politicians.
The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is, as clerical wags have put it, that the Jesuits have just as large a
percentage of lesser Esq.'s as any other church <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> but they are smart enough to hide
the numbskulls in their foreign missions to primitive countries. In fact, it has also been said,
that this is the principal <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> why the Jesuits have foreign missions.
However, in spite of these disparaging introductory qualifications, there can be no
gainsaying the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Jesuits possess a hard core of extremely intelligent, intensely
loyal, politically shrewd, carefully calculating individuals. This has been so since the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span>
of their founder, Ignatius of Loyola. A catalog of their names <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> include a large
percentage of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> minds of the Roman Catholic Church since the sixteenth century.
Any honest student of church history must admit that behind the scenes, they have
been the governing genius of the Vatican- even though, more often than not, an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span>
genius.
The Jesuit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> is an absolute monarchy. Their general, "the Black Pope" rules for
life. The pattern of their own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> has molded their thinking about all other political
structures, including, but not confined to, the Vatican.
The Jesuits fought the democratic aspirations of the French when they helped
engineer the "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve". They were the force behind Pope Pius
IX and were his principal counselors. The Italian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> knew that the Jesuits were the
strongest opponents of the Unification of Italy and hated them accordingly. The Jesuits
promoted the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and of the Infallibility of the Pope.
They wart, the experts behind the experts of the First Vatican Council in 1870 just as they
are of the <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">Second</span> Vatican Council.
It is obvious that an organization so vast (the largest in the Roman Church) covering
the globe, and engaged in so many activities, some open and honorable, and others
secret, delicate and "Jesuitical" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to have a <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of rules and regulations for its

own internal control much more detailed and stringent than the conventional "rules" or
"constitutions" of St. Benedict, St. Francis or the other run-of-the-mill orders and
congregations.

Knowing also that the bulk of the Jesuits at the grass roots did not possess the
sagacity, shrewdness and ruthlessness of the "boys" in the "back room" in Rome it was
necessary that many enterprises, such as "advising" rich widows, picking of rich men's
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> to be prospective Jesuits, or purging the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> of a hapless Jesuit who began to
think for himself, should be speeded out in detail.
But above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> it was necessary that such regulations should be kept secret. They
were to be confided only to trusted superiors and if accidentally found. they were to be
denounced as base forgeries.
They are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "MONIKA SECRETA SOCIETATIS JESU"-"The Secret Instructions
of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of Jesus."
The average "lower-case" Jesuit, not being in on the know, will sincerely tell indignant
devout inquirers that these regulations are fictitious. The smart "upper-case" Jesuit knows
that he had better deny their existence. He might not live to regret his indiscretion.
The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the "Secret Regulations of the Jesuits" has been proven beyond all
possibility of successful legal refutation.
Most unbiased historians of the Roman Catholic Church and of the Jesuits
acknowledge the <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of the "Monita".
The British historian, Andrew Steinmetz, in his monumental, precisely documented,
"History of the Jesuits", published in London in 1848, devotes several pages to an analysis
of the genuineness and history of the "Monita". He outlines the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> with the same
succession of chapters and content as reproduced in this present volume. He concludes
that "secret regulations" did exist, considering 1) overt statements of Jesuit Generals, 2)
missing chapters in early editions of the official "Constitutions", and 3) the actual conduct
of the Jesuits, in so many countries and for so long. As proof of the latter he cites the
catering to the rich, the rapid acquisition of tremendous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and wealth and the
infiltration of the royal powers by the Jesuits as court confessors, with their tolerance of
licentiousness in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> to gain power. (Vol. III, p. 363, 364, 365, 366). Of the allegations
themselves he cites thousands of documented instances in the 1660 pages of his
volumes.
The following paragraphs are from the autobiography of a very precise and erudite exJesuit. His <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> places him and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> beyond the customary effective reprisals of the
Order.

"The MONITA SECRETA SOCIETATIS JESU ('Secret Instruction of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of
Jesus') first appeared in print in Cracow in 1612, after they had already been circulated in
manuscript form. The editor seems to have been the ex-Jesuit Zahorowski. Almost
innumerable editions and reprints in all civilized tongues followed one another. The latest
edition was published at Bamberg in 1904."

"The importance of the publication follows from the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that, directly after its
appearance, the General of the Order, Mutius Vitelleschi, twice (in 1616 and 1617)
instructed the German Jesuit, Gretser, a prominent theologian of the Order, to refute it, and
that up to most recent times Jesuit after Jesuit has come forward to repudiate it."
"It is natural that the Jesuits themselves should deny the genuineness in a flood of
refutations. But such denials only merit the belief or unbelief which the denial of every
defendant deserves. Only sound proof can turn the scale against the genuineness of the
Monita. And such proofs have not been produced up to now by the Jesuits. Nor has any
convincing invalidation of the facts advanced on behalf of its genuineness been produced.
"The advocates of their genuineness rely essentially on the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the manuscript
copies of the Monita, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the printed edition is based, were to be found in Jesuit
colleges. The discovery of such copies in the colleges of Prague, Paris, Roermond
(Holland), Munich, and Paderborn is beyond question. The copy in the Jesuit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in
Paderborn was found 'in a cupboard in the Rector's room' (in scriniis rectoris). The
manuscript copy at Munich, belonging to the contents of the library of the Jesuit college of
this place, which was suppressed in 1773, was only found in 1870 in a secret recess
behind the altar of the old Jesuit Church of St. Michael at Munich. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a decisive
token of genuineness if it could be proved positively that the Prague copy was already
there in 1611 -- i.e. before the first printed edition in 1612. J. Friedrich's statement makes
this seem probable, but not certain. What the Jesuit Duhr writes to the contrary is of no
value. It is certain, however, that the discovery in Prague was so disagreeable to the
Jesuits that the chief champion of the spuriousness of the MONITA, the Jesuit Forer,
considered it advisable to <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> it over in silence in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of repudiation, Anatomia
Anatomiae Societatis Jesu. On the other hand, he zealously demonstrated-what no one
disputed- that the copy at Paderborn was only <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> after the first edition had
been published. Forer's silence is the more remarkable, as a manuscript note, intended for
his book, treats the Prague discovery as a fact. The saying that those who keep silence
when they could and should <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> seem to give consent, comes to my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of

beneath the pallet on an adobe bed in a cottage in the Andes Mountains of Peru about a
century ago.
Students of the Incas recall that prior to the expedition of the National Geographic
Magazine under Hiram Bingham, in 1911, archaeologists from European countries probed
the ruins of this people, one of the greatest civilizations in history.
In 1870 a French archeologist slipped unobtrusively into the office of the Secretary of
the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in San Francisco, California.
He had been sent into the remote recesses of the Andes, where Pizarro and his army
had conquered the Incas more than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries before. He had rented a room in a tiny
village. This he <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as a base of his operations. To this spot he returned periodically to
rest from the dangerously <span class="t23 hoverable">high</span> altitudes and to write his reports for shipment back to
France.
While he was away, the family frequently rented the same room to overnight guests.
One of these happened to be a Jesuit official. On his departure he forgot a little <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span>
which he had hidden under the mattress. The French archeologist accidentally found it.
It was the "Secret Instructions of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of Jesus"- the top classified manual of
procedure for the trusted leaders of the Jesuit Order.
It was in Latin and bore the seal, signature and attestation of the General and Secretary of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> in Rome.
For the next few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> the Frenchman labored furiously translating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in
stenographic notes into French. He then replaced the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> and left.
The Jesuit returned in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> inquiring nervously about his little black packet. He
also wanted to know if anyone had occupied the room since his departure. On learning of
the archeologist he began a search so relentless that the Frenchman had to leave Peru.
He finally reached San Francisco and entrusted his precious but dangerous burden to
Edwin A. Sherman 32 degree Mason, the Secretary of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in
California.
Mr. Sherman included the "Secret Instructions" in his <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">book</span> "The Engineer Corps of
Hell" published in 1882.

For several <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> Edwin Sherman was the Masonic Historian of California. He was
highly esteemed for his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> accuracy and dependability. This can be verified now by
anyone who will inquire about him of the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of

Hoensbroech in Germany, Considering that Von Hoensbroech's rendition was translated
from the German and Sherman's from Latin to French and then into English the similarity
is still striking.
Here are a few examples:

Sherman: Ch. XI -- "How We Must Conduct Ourselves Unitedly Against
Those Who Have Been Expelled From the
Society."

Von Hoensbroech:

"What Attitude Should Be <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">Taken</span> By Our Followers

In Regard to Those Dismissed From the Order?"

Sherman: Ch. VI -- "OF the Mode of Attracting Rich Widows."

Von Hoensbroech:

"How May Rich Widows be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Well</span> Disposed Towards

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> that follows is one of the most effective documents ever written. The
tremendous wealth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Jesuit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> is ample proof of that contention.
Those who have observed the Jesuits from the vantage point of the secular clergy or
of another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">order</span> have often wondered at their astounding success in becoming the
recipients of wealthy estates, of influencing prominent citizens, Catholic and non-Catholic
alike, into endorsing and endowing their colleges and universities, of instilling their
scholastics and other students with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of self-dedication and self immolation that

A careful study of the "Secret Instructions" will give the answer. Here is a plan of
financial, intellectual and military strategy that should make the planners of West Point or
<span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">Number</span> 10 Downing Street feel inferior.
Check, for example the following:
Ch. II -- "THE MANNER WITH WHICH THE FATHERS OF THE <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span> MUST
CONDUCT THEMSELVES TO ACQUIRE AND PRESERVE THE
FAMILIARITY OF PRINCES, MAGNATES, AND POWERFUL AND RICH
PERSONS."
(Think then how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> the Jesuits have done with the local <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">State</span> Bar, the Chamber of

Ch. VI-"OF THE MODE OF ATTRACTING RICH WIDOWS."
Just read them and weep, brethren! Read especially this sentence p. 8 "Insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

repeated one, and the dangers to which she will be exposed, relatively to her particular
businesses into which we are desirous of penetrating."
Ch. XI-"HOW WE MUST CONDUCT OURSELVES UNITEDLY AGAINST THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE SOCIETY."

This is a portrait of the pattern of persecution and annihilation that every ex-Jesuit, and
in truth, every past ex-priest knows, and every future dissident can expect.
Ch. XV-"HOW THE COMPANY MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH THE MONKS AND
NUNS."
(Meaning other religious Orders-of course)
Ch. XVI-"HOW WE MUST MAKE PROFESSION OF DESPISING RICHES."
The gem of them all-really <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> "How we must pretend to despise riches."
What more vicious enemies could the bishops and diocesan clergy have than those
Jesuit Monitors who wrote: "We must inquire into and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> the defects of the other fathers

condoling over them." (Ch. V. p. 17)
Read the Jesuits' opinion of other religious orders "calling attention to the indolence
and stupidity of the Monks as if they were cattle." (Ch. XVII P. 41)
The Jesuits themselves should be concerned with the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that history does repeat
itself. In Mexico, in Peru, in France, in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in Portugal, in Paraguay,
in Colombia, in Brazil, in Argentina, in Chile, in Austria and in very many other countries
the Jesuits gained so much wealth, in land, in buildings and in money, that others became
jealous.
In every country the Jesuits were thrown out. Their property and wealth was
confiscated.
The Jesuits are now repeating their history in the United States of America. Their
landed wealth and holdings are fabulous.
What makes them think that history will not inexorably and inevitably repeat itself again
here in America?

PREFACE
These particular instructions must be guarded and kept with careful attention by the
superiors, communicated with prudent caution to a few of the professors; in the meantime

there does not exist any other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for the Society; but we are charged with the
most profound silence, and to make a false show, should they be <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> by any one

these secrets, the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> has fixed the rule, that those who know these reserved
instructions that they cannot <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span> in any one religious Order, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> it be of the
Carthusians, to cause them to retire from that in which they live, and the inviolable silence
with which they are to be guarded, all of which has been confirmed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> See. Much

persons to the Society, because they will give a sinister interpretation invidious to our
situation.
If (unless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> does not permit) we reach success, we must openly deny that the

<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> that they are ignorant by not having been communicated, which they can protest
with truth, that they know nothing of such instructions; and that there does not exist other
than the general printed or manuscripts, which they can present, to cause any doubt to
vanish. The superiors must with prudence and discretion, inquire if any of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> have
shown these instructions to strangers; for neither for himself, or for another, they must be
copied by no one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> permission of the General or of the Provincial; and when it is
feared that anyone has given notice of these instructions, we shall not be able to guard so
rigorous a secret; and we must assert to the contrary, all that is said in them, it will be so
given to be understood, that they only show to all, to be proved, and afterwards they will
be dismissed.

THE MANNER OF PROCEDURE WITH WHICH THE <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span>
MUST BE CONDUCTED WHEN CONSIDERING THE COMMENCING
OF SOME FOUNDATION.
1.
To capture the will of the inhabitants of a country, it is very important to
manifest the intent of the Society, in the manner prescribed in the regulations in which it is
said, that the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> must labor with such ardor and force for the salvation of their
neighbor as for themselves. For the better inducement of this idea, the most opportunely
that we practice the most humble offices, visiting the poor, the afflicted, and the
imprisoned. It is very convenient to confess with much promptness, and to hear the
confessions, showing indifference, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> teasing the penitents; for this, the most notable
inhabitants will admire our fathers and esteem them; for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> charity they have for all,
and the novelty of the subject.

2.
To have in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that it is necessary to ask with religious modesty, the means
for exercising the duties of the Society, and that it is needful to procure and acquire

benevolence, principally of the secular ecclesiastics, and of persons of authority, that may
be conceived necessary.
3.
When <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to go to the most distant places, where alms are to be received,
they are to be accepted, no <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> how small they may be, after having marked out the
necessities of ourselves. Notwithstanding, it will be very convenient at the moment to give
those alms to the poor, for the edification of those who do not have an exact understanding
of the Society; and, "but we must in advance be more liberal with ourselves."
4.
All must labor as if we were inspired by the same spirit; and each one must
study to acquire the same styles, with the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of uniformity among so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of
persons, edifying the whole; those who do the contrary must be expelled as pernicious.
5.
In a beginning it is not convenient to purchase property; but in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> they can
be found, some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sites may be bought, saying that they are to belong to other persons,
using the names of some faithful friends, who will guard the secret. The better to make our
poverty apparent, the property nearest our college must belong to colleges the most
distant, that we can prevent the princes and magistrates from ever knowing that the
income of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> has a fixed point.
6.
We must not ourselves go out to reside to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> colleges, except to the rich
cities; for in this we must imitate Christ, who remained in Jerusalem; and as he alone,
passed by the less considerable populations.
7.
We must obtain and acquire of the widows all the money that we can,
presenting ourselves at repeated times to their sight our extreme necessity.
8.
The Superior over each province is the one to whom we must <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> with
certainty, the income of the same; but the amount to the treasurer at Rome, it is, and must
always be, an impenetrable mystery.
9.
It is for us to preach and say in all parts and in all conversations, that we have
come to teach the young and aid the people; and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> interest in any single species

1.
It is necessary to do all that is possible to gain completely the attentions and
affections of princes and persons of the most consideration; for that, who, being on the
outside, but in advance, all of them will be constituted our defenders.
2.
As we have learned by experience that princes and potentates are generally
inclined to the favor of the ecclesiastics, when these disseminate their odious actions, and
when they give an interpretation that they favor, as is to be noted among the married,
contract with their relations or allies; or in other similar things; assembling much with them,
to animate those who may be found in this case, saying to them that we confide in the
assurance of the exemptions, that by intervention of us fathers, which the Pope will
concede, if he is made to see the causes, and will present other examples of similar
things, exhibiting at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the sentiments that we favor, under the pretext of the
common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and THE GREATER <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">GLORY</span> OF <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">GOD</span> that is the <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> of the Society.
3.
If at this same assembly the prince treats of doing something, that will not be
agreeable to all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men, for which we are to stir up and investigate, meanwhile,
counseling others to conform with the prince, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> ever descending to treat of
particulars, for <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> there may not be a successful issue of the matter, for which the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span>
will be imputed blame; and for this, if this action shall be disapproved, there will be
advertences presented to the contrary that may be absolutely prohibited and put in
jeopardy, the authority of some of the fathers, of whom it can be said with certainty, that
they have not had notice of the Secret Instructions; for that, it can be affirmed with an oath,
that the calumny to the Society, is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in respect to that which is imputed to it.
4.
To gain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will of Princes, it will be very convenient to insinuate with
skill; and for <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> persons, that we fathers, are a means to discharge honorable and
favorable duties in the courts of other kings and princes, and more than any one else in
that of the Pope. By this means we can recommend ourselves and the Society; for the
same, no one must be charged with this commission but the most zealous persons and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> versed in our institute.

Aiming especially to <span class="t4 t6 t7 t9 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 hoverable">bring</span> over the will of the favorites of princes and of their
servants, by means of presents and pious offices, that they may give faithful notice to us
fathers of the character and inclinations of the princes and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men. Of this manner the

The experience we have had, has made us acquainted with the many
advantages that have been <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of its intervention in the marriages of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Austria, and of those which have been effected in other kingdoms, France,
Poland, and in various duchies. Forasmuch assembling, proposing with prudence,
selecting choice persons who may be friends and families of the relatives, and of the
friends of the Society.

It will be easy to gain the princesses, making <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of their valets; by that,
coming to feed and nourish with relations of friendship, by being located at the entrance in
all parts, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> become acquainted with the most intimate secrets of the familiars.
8.
In regard to the direction of the consciences of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> men, we confessors
must follow the writers who concede the greater liberty of conscience. The contrary of this
is to appear too religious; for that they will decide to leave others and submit entirely to our
direction and counsels.
9.

It is necessary to make reference to all the merits of the

Society; to the princes and prelates, and to as many as can lend much aid to the Society,
after having shown the transcendence of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> privileges.
10.
Also, it will be useful to demonstrate, with prudence and skill, such ample
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> has, to absolve, even in the reserved cases, compared with that
of other pastors and priests; also, that of dispensing with the fasts, and of the rights which
they must ask and pay, in the impediments of marriage, by which means many persons
will recur to us, whom it will be our duty to make agreeable.
11.
It is not the less useful to invite them to our sermons, assemblies,
harangues, declamations, etc., composing odes in their honor, dedicating literary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> or
conclusions; and if we can for the future, give dinners and greetings of divers modes.
12.
It will be very convenient to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> to our care the reconciliation of the great, in
the quarrels and enmities that divide them; then by this method we can enter, little by little,
into the acquaintance of their most intimate friends and secrets; and we can serve
ourselves to that party which will be most in favor of that which we present.
13.
If there should be some one at the service of a monarch or prince, and he
were an enemy of our Society, it is necessary to procure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> for ourselves better than for
others, making him a friend, employing promises, favors, and advances, which shall be in
proportion to the same monarch or prince.
14.
No one shall recommend to a prince any one, nor make advances to any
who have gone out from us, being outside of our Society, and in particular to those who
voluntarily verified, for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> when they dissimulate they will always maintain an
inextinguishable hatred to the Society.

HOW THE <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span> MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">GREAT</span>

RICH WE MUST LEND OURSELVES TO OTHERS.
1.
The care consigned to us, that we must do all that is possible, for to conquer
the great; but it is also necessary to gain their favor to combat our enemies.
2.
It is very conducive to value their authority, prudence and counsels, and
induce them to despise wealth, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that we procure gain and employ those
that can redeem the Society; tacitly valuing their names, for acquisition of temporal goods
if they inspire sufficient confidence.
3.
It is also necessary to employ the ascendant of the powerful, to temper the
malevolence of the persons of a lower sphere and of the rabble against our Society.
4.
It is necessary to utilize, whenever we can, the bishops, prelates and other
superior ecclesiastics, according to the diversity of reason, and the inclination we manifest.
5.
In some points it will be sufficient to obtain of the prelates and curates, that
which it is possible to do, that their subjects respect the society; and that obstructing the
exercise of its functions among those who have the greatest power, as in Germany,
Poland, etc. It will be necessary to exhibit the most distinguished attentions for that,
mediating its authority and that of the princes, monasteries, parishes, priorates,
patronates, the foundations of the churches and the pious places, can come to our power.
Because we can with more facility where the Catholics will be found mixed with heretics. It
is necessary to make such prelates see the utility and merit that we have in all this, and
that never will they have so much valuation from the priests, friars, and for the future from
the faithful. If making these changes, it is necessary to publicly praise their zeal, although
written, and to perpetuate the memory of their actions.
6.
For this it is necessary to labor, to the end, that the prelates will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the
<span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of us fathers, as confessors and counselors; and if they aspire to more elevated
positions in the Court of Rome, we must unite in their favor and aid their pretensions with
all our forces, and by means of our influence.
7.
We must be watchful that when the bishops are instituting principal colleges
and parochial churches, that the faculties are <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> from the Society, and placed in both
vicarious establishments, with the charge of cures, and that the Superior of

the parishioners shall be our subjects, of the method that all can be placed in them.

8.
Where there are those of the academies who have been driven out from us,
and are contrary; where the Catholics or the heretics obstruct our installation, we will
compound with the prelates, and make ourselves the owners of the first cathedrals; for
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> shall we make them to know the necessities of the Society.
9.
Over all, we must be very certain to procure the protection and affection of the
prelates of the Church, for the cases of beatification or canonization of ourselves; in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
subjects convened further, to obtain letters from the powerful and of the princes, that the
decisions may be promptly attained in the Catholic Court.
10.
If it shall be accounted that the prelates or magnates should send
commissioned representatives, we must put forth all ardor, that no other priests, who are in
dispute with us, shall be sent; for the reason, that they shall not communicate their
animadversion, discrediting us in the cities and provinces we inhabit; and that if they <span class="t6 t9 t13 t15 t17 t18 t23 t28 t29 hoverable">pass</span>
by other provinces and cities, where there are colleges, they will be received with affection
and kindness, and be so splendidly treated as a religious modesty will permit.

Those of us who may be directed to the princes and illustrious men, of the
manner in which we must appear before them, with inclination unitedly "to the greater <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span>
of God," obtaining-with its austerity of conscience, that the same princes are persuaded of
it; for this direction we must not travel in a principle to the exterior or political government,
but gradually and imperceptibly.
2.
Forasmuch there will be opportunity and conducive notices at repeated times,
that the distribution of honors and dignities in the Republic is an act of justice; and that in a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> manner it will be offending God, if the princes do not examine themselves and cease
carrying their passions, protesting to the same with frequency and severity, that we do not
<span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to mix in the administration of the State; but when it shall become necessary to so
express ourselves thus, to have your weight to fill the mission that is recommended.
Directly that the sovereigns are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> convinced of this, it will be very convenient to give an
idea of the virtues that may be found to adorn those that are selected for the dignities and
principal public changes; procuring then and recommending the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> friends of the Society;

who have intimacy with the prince that it is not for us to talk him into the disposition of
making them.

3.
For this watchfulness our friends must instruct the confessors and preachers
of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> near the persons capable of discharging any duty, that over all, they must be

generous to the Society; they must also keep their names, that they may insinuate with

Never receive gifts made to any one in particular, but that for the contrary; but
picture the distress in which the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> or college may be found, as all are alike; having to

to the princes and lords that are always ours, and being constituted in power, that our
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> contains essentially the perfection of all the other orders, with the exception of
singing and manifesting an exterior of austerity in the mode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and in dress; and that if

relieve them from the pains of purgatory.
2.
The same confessor will propose to them to make and adorn a little chapel or
oratory in their own house, to confirm their religious exercises, because by this method we
can shorten the communication, more easily hindering those who visit others; although if
they have a particular chaplain, and will content to go to him to celebrate the mass, making
opportune advertencies to her who confesses, to the effect and treating her as being <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to
be overpowered by said Chaplain.
3.
We must endeavor skillfully but gently to cause them to change respectively to

We must not omit to have removed, little by little, the servants of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span>

5.
The constant watch of the confessor will have to be, that the widow shall be
disposed to depend on him totally, representing that her advances in grace are necessarily
bound to this submission.
6.
We are to induce her to the frequency of the sacraments, and especially that
of penitence, making her to give <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of her deeper thoughts and intentions; inviting
her to listen to her confessor, when he is to preach particular promising orations;
recommending equally the recitation each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the litanies and the examination of

7.
It will be very necessary in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a general confession, to enter
extensively into all of her inclinations; for that it will be to determine her, although she may
be found in the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of others.
8.
Insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the advantages of widowhood, and the inconvenience of marriage;
in particular that of a repeated one, and the dangers to which she will be exposed,
relatively to her particular businesses into which we are desirous of penetrating.
9.
We must cause her to talk of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> whom she dislikes, and to see if she takes
notice of anyone who is agreeable, and represent to her that he is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of bad life;
procuring by these means disgust of one and another, and repugnant to unite with anyone.
10.
When the confessor has become convinced that she has decided to follow
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of widowhood, he must then proceed to counsel her to dedicate herself to a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, but not to a monastic one, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> lack of accommodations will show how they
live; in a word, we must proceed to <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of Pauline and of Eustace, &c.
The confessor will conduct her at last, that having devoted the widow to chastity, to not
less than for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> years, she will then be made to renounce a <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> nuptial
forever. In this <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> she will be found to have discarded all sorts of relations with men,
and even the diversions between her relatives and acquaintances, we must protest that
she must unite more closely to God. With regard to the ecclesiastics who visit her, or to
whom she goes out to visit, when we cannot keep her separate and apart from all others,
we must labor that those with whom she treats shall be recommended by ourselves or by
those who are devoted to us.
11.
In this state, we must inspire her to give alms, under the direction, as she will
suppose, or her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> father; then it is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance that they shall be employed

SYSTEM WHICH MUST BE EMPLOYED WITH WIDOWS
AND METHODS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR PROPERTY.

1.
It will be necessary to inspire her to continue to persevere in her devotion and
the exercise of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> and of disposition, in not permitting a week to pass, to give
away some part of her over plus, in honor of <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> Christ, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Virgin and of the
Saint she has chosen for her patron; giving this to the poor of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> or for the
ornamenting of its churches, until she has absolutely disposed of the first fruits of her
property as in other times did the Egyptians.
2.
When the widows, the more generally to practice their alms, must be given to
know with perseverance, their liberality in favor of the Society; and they are to be assured
that they are participants in all the merits of the same, and of the particular indulgences of
the Provincial; and if they are persons of much consideration, of the General of the Order.
3.
The widows who having made vows of chastity, it will be necessary for them to
renew them twice per annum, conforming to the custom that we have established; but
permitting them notwithstanding, that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> some honest freedom from restraint by our
fathers.
4.
They must be frequently visited, treating them agreeably; referring them to
spirited and diverting histories, conformable to the character and inclination of each one.
5.
But that they may not abate, we must not <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> too much rigor with them in the
confessional; that it may not be, that they by having empowered others of their
benevolence, that we do not lose confidence of recovering their adhesion, having to
proceed in all cases with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> skill and caution, being aware of the inconstancy natural to
woman.
6.
It is necessary to have them do away with the habit of frequenting other
churches, in particular those of convents; for which it is necessary to often remind them,
that in our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> there are possessed many indulgences that are to be obtained only
partially by all the other religious corporations.
7.
To those who may be found in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the garb of mourning, they will be
counseled to dress a little more agreeable, that they may at the same time, unite the
aspect of mourning with that of adornment, to draw them away from the idea of being
found directed by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has become a stranger to the world. Also with such, that they
may not be very much endangered, or particularly exposed to volubility, we can concede to
them, as if they maintained their consequence and liberality, for and with the society, that
which drives ensuality away from them, being with moderation and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> scandal.
8.
We must manage that in the houses of the widows there shall be honorable
young ladies, of rich and noble families; that little by little they become accustomed to our
direction and mode of life;

and that they are given a director elected and established by the confessor of the family, to
be permanently and always subject to all the reprehensions and habits of the Society; and

if any do not wish to submit to all, they must be sent to the houses of their fathers, or to
those from which they were brought, accusing them directly of extravagance and of glaring
and stained character.
9.
The care of the health of the widows, and to proportion some amusement, it is
not the least important that we should care for their salvation; and so, if they complain of
some indisposition, we must prohibit the fast, the hair cloth girdle, and the discipline,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> permitting them to go to church; further continue the direction, cautiously and
secretly with such, that they may be examined in their houses; if they are given admission
into the garden, and edifice of the college, with secrecy; and if they consent to converse
and secretly entertain with those that they prefer.
10.
To the end that we may obtain, that the widows employ their utmost
obsequiousness to the Society, it is the duty to represent to them the perfection of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of the holy, who have renounced the world, estranged themselves from their relations, and
despising their fortunes, consecrating themselves to the service of the Supreme Being with
entire resignation and content. It will be necessary to produce the same effect, that those
who turn away to the Constitutions of the Society, and their relative examination to the
abandonment of all things. We must cite examples of the widows who have reached
holiness in a very short time; giving hopes of their being canonized, if their perseverance
does not decay; and promising for their cases our influence with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Father.
11.
We must impress in their souls the persuasion that, if they <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to enjoy
complete tranquility of conscience it will be necessary for them to follow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

spiritual, as in the eternal, that she may be found destined to the same God, by their
guidance.
12.
Also we must direct with opportunity, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> does not <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> that they
should give alms, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> to fathers of an exemplary life, known and approved, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
consulting beforehand with their confessor, and regulating the dictation of the same.
13.
The confessors must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the greatest care, that the widows and their
daughters of the confessional, do not go to see other fathers (i.e. non-Jesuit priests) under
any pretext, nor with them. For this, we must praise our <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> most
illustrious of them all; of greater utility in the Church, and of greater authority with the Pope
and with the princes; perfection in itself; then dismiss the dream of them, and menace
them, that we can, and that we are no correspondents to them, we can say, that we do not
consent to froth and do as among other monks who count in their convents many ignorant,
stupid loungers who are indolent in regard to the other life, and intriguers in that to
disorder, &c.
14.
The confessors must propose and persuade the widows to assign ordinary
pensions and other annual quotas to the colleges and houses of profession for their
sustenance with especially to

ornaments of the temples and replenishing of the wax, the wine, and other necessaries for
the celebration of the mass.
15.
If they do not make relinquishment of their property to the Society, it will be
made manifest to them, on apparent occasion in particular, when they are found to be sick,
or in danger of death; that there are many colleges to be founded; and that they may be
excited with sweetness and disinterestedness, to make some disbursements as merit for
God, and in that they can found his <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> glory.

against its enemies that are very powerful, or like that little stone prognosticated by the

We must do all that is possible that the masters and professors of the youth

counsel them; but if they cannot be reduced, we must cause them to be deprived of some

that they may be tired of that sort of life; and if, finally, we cannot obtain their will to enter
the Society, we must labor; because we can remand them to other colleges of ours that
are at a distance, that they may study, procuring impediment, that their mothers show
endearment and affection, at the same time, continuing for our part, in drawing them to us

occasion of receiving always as much as may be offered. If promises and the fulfillment of
them is retarded, they are to be remembered with precaution, dissimulating as much as we
can the coveting of riches. When some confessor of personages or other people, will not
be apt, or wants subtility, that in these subjects is indispensable, he will be retired with
opportunity, although others may be placed anticipated; and if it be entirely necessary to
the penitents, it will be made necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> out the destitute to distant colleges,

To attract the prelates, canonicals and other rich ecclesiastics, it is necessary
to employ certain arts, and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> procuring them to practice in our houses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>

so that they will be affectionate towards the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> and that they will soon offer pledges of
their adhesion.
3.
The confessors must not forget to ask with the greatest caution and on
adequate occasions of those who confess, what are their names, families, relatives,
friends, and properties, informing their successors who follow them, the state, intention in
which they will be found, and the resolution which they have taken; that which they have
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> determined obtaining, having to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> a plan for the future to the Society. When it is
founded, whence directly there are hopes of utility; for it will not be convenient to ask all at
once; they will be counseled to make their confession each week, to disembarrass the
conscience much before, or to the title of penitence. They will be caused to inform the
confessor with repetition, of that which at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they have not given sufficient light; and
if they have been successful by this means, she will come, being a woman, to make
confession with frequency, and visit our church; and being a man, he will be invited to our

That which is said in regard to widows, must have equal application to the
merchants and neighbors of all classes, as being rich and married, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> children, of

6.
The essential point to build upon, is the following: that we must so manage,
that in the ends we gain the will and affections of our penitents, and other persons with
whom we treat, accommodating ourselves to their inclinations if they are conducive. The
Provincials will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care to direct some of us to points, in which reside the nobility and the
powerful; and if the Provincials do not act with opportunity, the rectors must notice with
anticipation, the crops (the field of operations) that are there, which we go to examine.

When we receive the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of strong houses in the Society, they must show
<span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> they will be easy to acquire the contracts and titles of possession; and if so they
were to enter of themselves, of which they may be caused to cede some of their property

When the widows, or our married devoted women, do not have more than
daughters, we must persuade them to the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of devotion, or to that of the cloister;
but that except the endowment that they may give, they can enter their property in the

will be catechized; and others who <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to enter as religiousness in other Orders, with
the promise of some reduced amount. When there may be an only son, he must be
attracted at all cost, inculcating the vocation as made by <span class="t0 t6 t8 t9 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t22 t23 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Jesus</span> Christ; causing him to be
entirely disembarrassed from the <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> of its fathers, and persuading him to make a
<span class="t2 t9 t10 t16 t18 t19 t27 t28 hoverable">sacrifice</span> very acceptable to the Almighty, that he must withdraw to His authority, abandon
the paternal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and enter in the Society; the which, if he so succeeds, after having
given part to the General, he will be sent to a distant novitiate; but if they have daughters,
they will primarily dispose the daughters for a religious life; and they will be caused to
enter into some monastery, and afterwards be received as daughters in the Society, with
the succession of its properties.

sin; and that we cannot employ the alms better, than in the maintaining and subsidizing of
the persons, who, by their vocation, have made profession of caring for the salvation of
their neighbor; that in this manner the sick can be made to participate in their merits, and
<span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> satisfaction for their own sins; placing before them that charity covereth a multitude of
sins; and that also, we can describe that charity, is as a nuptial vestment, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> which,

poor relations. Furthermore, that he may not complain afterwards of the cause of his
expulsion, it will be necessary to thrust him from us directly; but we can prohibit him from
hearing confessions, which will mortify him, and vex him by imposing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him most vile

chapters by public censures; he will be excluded from the recreations and prohibited from
all conversation with strangers; he will be deprived of his vestments and the uses of other

2.
Furthermore, having also expelled all those who may have scrupled to acquire
properties for the Society, we must direct, that they are too much addicted to their own
judgment. If we <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to give <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of their conduct to the Provincials, it is necessary not

It will be necessary to note, whence the beginning and whence their youth,

affection until the furthest orders, or until their relatives, or until the poor shall be
necessarily disposed, little by little, as carefully said, to go out; then they are useless.

HOW WE MUST CONDUCT OURSELVES
UNITEDLY AGAINST THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE SOCIETY.
1.
As those whom we have expelled, when knowing little or something of the
secrets, the most times are noxious to the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> for the same, it shall be necessary to
obviate their efforts by the following method, before thrusting them out; it will be necessary

to obligate them to promise, by writing, and under oath, that they will never by writing or
speaking, do anything which may be prejudicial to the Society; and it will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> that the
Superiors guard a point of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> inclinations, of their defects and of their vices; that they
are the same, having to manifest in the discharge of their duties, following the custom of
the Society, for that, if it should be necessary, this point can serve near the great, and the
prelates to hinder their advancement.
2.
Constant notice must be given to an the colleges of their having been
expelled; and we must exaggerate the general motives of their expulsion; as the little
mortification of their spirit; their disobedience; their little <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> exercises; their
self love, &c., &c. Afterwards, we must admonish them, that they must not have any
correspondence with them; and they must <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> of them as strangers; that the language
of all shall be uniform, and that it may be told everywhere, that the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> never expels
any one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> very grave causes, and that as the sea casts up dead bodies, &c., &c. We
must insinuate with caution, similar reasons to these, causing them to be abhorred by the
people, that for their expulsion it may appear plausible.
3.
In the domestic exhortations, it will be necessary to persuade <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> that they
have been turned out as unquiet persons; that they continue to beg each moment to enter
anew into the Society; and it will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to exaggerate the misfortunes of those who have
perished miserably, after having separated from the Society.
4.
It will also be opportune to send forth the accusations, that they have gone out
from the Society, which we can formulate by means of grave persons, who will everywhere
repeat that the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> never expels any one but for grave causes; and that they never
part with their healthy members; the which they can confirm by their zeal, and show in
general for the salvation of the souls of them that do not pertain to them; and how much
greater will it not be for the salvation of their own.
5.
Afterwards, the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> must prepare and attract by all classes of benefits, the
magnates, or prelates, with whom those who have been expelled begin to enjoy some
authority and credit. It will be necessary to show that the common <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Order</span> so
celebrated as useful in the Church, must be of more consideration, than that if a particular
one who has been cast out. If an this affliction preserves some affection for those expelled,
it will be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to indicate the reasons which have caused their expulsion; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
exaggerate the causes the more that they were not very true; with such they can draw
their conclusions as to the probable consequences.
6.
Of all modes, it will be necessary that they particularly have abandoned the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> by their own <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> will; not being promoted to a single employment or dignity in the
Church; that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not submit themselves and much that pertains to the Society; and
that all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> should withdraw from them that <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to depend on them.

Procuring soon, that they are removed from the exercise of the functions

themselves well, we must curtail them by subtle propositions and captious phrases, their
virtues and meritorious actions, causing that the idea that has been formed of them, and
the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> that is had in them, may little by little be made to disappear; this is of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

such as the confessors of princes, of the powerful, of the widows, of the rich pious women,

Those who have already failed in strength or advanced in years; conforming
to the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> they have made of their talents in and for the temporal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of the Society; of

acquiring a bad reputation.

Furthermore, it will be necessary to favor those who excel by their talent, their
nobleness and their fortune; particularly if they have powerful friends attached to the
Society; and if they themselves have for it a sincere appreciation, as we have already said
before. They must be sent to Rome, or to the universities of

OF THE YOUTH WHO MAY BE ELECTED TO BE ADMITTED
INTO THE SOCIETY,
AND OF THE MODE OF RETAINING THEM.
1.
It is necessary that much prudence shall be exercised, respecting the election
of the Youth; having to be sprightly, noble, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> liked, or at the least excellent in some of
these qualities.
2.
To attract them with greater facility to our institute, it is necessary in the
meanwhile, to study that the rectors and professors of colleges shall exhibit an especial
affection; and outside the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the classes, to make them comprehend how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> is
God, and that some one should consecrate to his service all that he possesses; and
particularly if he is in the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of his Son.
3.
Whenever the opportunity may arrive, conducive in the college and in the
garden, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> at times to the country houses, that in the company of ourselves, during
the recreations, that we may familiarize with them, little by little, being careful,
notwithstanding, that the familiarity does not engender disgust.
4.
We cannot consent that we shall punish them, nor oblige them to assemble at
their tasks among those who are the most educated.
5.
We must congratulate them with gifts and privileges conforming to their age
and encouraging above all others with moral discourses.
6.
We must inculcate them, that it is for one <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> disposition, that they are
favorites among so many who frequent the same college.
7.
On other occasions, especially in the exhortations, we must aim to terrify them
with menaces of the <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> condemnation, if they refuse the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> vocation.

8.

Meanwhile frequently expressing the anxiety to enter the

Society, we must always defer their admission, that they may remain constant; but if for
these, they are undecided, then we must encourage them incessantly by other methods.
9.
If we admonish effectively, that none of their friends, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the fathers, nor
the mothers discover their vocation before being admitted; because then, if then, they
come to the temptation of withdrawing; so many as the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> desires to give <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> liberty of
doing that which may be the most convenient; and in <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of succeeding to conquer the
temptation, we must never lose occasions to make them recover spirit; remembering that
which we have said, always that this will succeed during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the novitiate, or after
having made their simple vows.
10.
With respect to the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of the great, nobles, and senators, as it is
supremely difficult to attract them, meanwhile living with their fathers, who are having them
educated to the end, that they may succeed in their destinies, we must persuade,
vigorously, of the better influences of friends that are persons of the same Society; that
they are ordered to other provinces, or to distant universities in which there are our
teachers; careful to remit to the respective professors the necessary instructions,
appropriate to their quality and condition, that they may gain their friendship for the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span>
with greater facility and certainty.
11.
When having arrived at a more advanced age, they will be induced to
practice some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> exercises, that they may have so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> an exit in Germany and
Poland.
12.
We must console them in their sadness and afflictions, according to the
quality and dispositions of each one, making <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of private reprimands and exhortations
appropriate to the bad <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of riches; inculcating <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them that they should depreciate the
felicity of a vocation, menacing them with the pains of hell for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> they do.
13.
It will be necessary to make patent to the fathers and the mothers, that they
may condescend more easily to the <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> of their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> of entering the Society, the
excellence of its institute in comparison with those of other orders; the sanctity and the
science of our fathers; its reputation in all the world; the honor and distinctions of the
different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and small. We must make enumeration of the princes and the magnates,
that, with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> content, have lived until their death, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> living in the Society. We must
show how agreeable it is to God, that the youth consecrate themselves to Him, particularly
in the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> of his Son: and what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> is there so sublime as that of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> carrying the

EXPULSION FROM THE SOCIETY.
1.
To most of the cases expressed in the Constitutions, and of which only the
Superior or the ordinary confessor, with permission of this, can absolve them, where there
is sodomy, unnatural crime, formication, adultery, of the unchaste touch of a man, or of a
woman; also if under the pretext of Zeal, or whatever motive, they have done some grave
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> against the Society; against its honors and its gains; these will be just causes for
<span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> of the expulsion of the guilty.
2.
If anyone confesses in the confessional of having committed some similar act,
he will not be promised absolution, until he has promised to reveal to the Superior, outside
of the confessional, the same or by his confessor. The Superior will operate the better for
it, in the general interests of the Society; further, if there is founded hope of the careful
hiding of the crime, it will be necessary to impose <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the guilty a convenient
punishment; if otherwise he can be expelled much before. With all the care that is
possible, the confessor will give the penitent to understand that he runs the danger of
being expelled.
3.
If any one of our confessors, having <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> a strange <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> say, that he had
committed a shameful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">thing</span> with one of the Society, he will not absolve such a person,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his having said, outside of his confession, the name of the one with whom he has
sinned; and if he so says, he will be made to swear that he will not divulge the same,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the consent of the Society.
4.
If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> of ourselves have sinned carnally, he who first avows it will be retained
in the Society; and the other will be expelled; but he who remains permanent, will be after
such mortification and bad treatment, of sorrow, and by his impatience, and if we have
occasion for his expulsion, it will be necessary for the future of it that it be done directly.
5.

The <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> being a noble corporation and preeminent in the

Church, it can dismiss those that will not be apt for the execution of our object, although
giving satisfaction in the beginning; and the opportunity does not delay in presenting itself;
if it procures continuous maltreatment; and if he is obliged to do contrary to his inclination;
if they are gathered under the orders of gloomy Superiors; if he is separated from his
studies and from the honorable functions, &c., &c., until be gets to murmuring.
6.
In no manner must we retain in the Society, those that openly reveal against
their Superiors, or that will complain publicly, or reservedly, of their companions, or
particularly if they make them to strangers; nor to those who are among ourselves, or
among persons who are on the outside, censure the conduct of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> in regard to
the acquisition or administration of temporal properties, or whatever acts of the same; for
example, of crushing or oppressing many of those whom we do not wish well, or that they

7.
Before the expulsion of any we must vex and harass them in the extreme;
depriving them of the functions that they have been accustomed to discharge, dedicating
them to others. Although they may do well, it will be necessary to censure them, and with
this pretext, apply them to another thing. Imposing by a trifling fault that they have
committed the most severe penalties, that they blush in public, until they have lost all
patience; and at last will be expelled as pernicious to all, for which a future opportunity will
present itself when they will think less.
8.
When some one of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> has a certain hope of obtaining a bishopric, or
whatever other ecclesiastical dignity, to most of the ordinary vows of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> he will be
obliged to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> another; and that is, that he will always preserve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> sentiments towards
the Society; that he will always <span class="t9 t11 t20 t21 t22 t23 t27 hoverable">speak</span> favorably of it; that he will not have a confessor that
will not be to its bosom; that he will do nothing of entity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having <span class="t13 t14 t15 t18 t27 hoverable">heard</span> the justice of
the same. Because in consequence of not having observed this, the Cardinal Tolet the

HOW THE <span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span> MUST BE CONDUCTED
WITH THE MONKS AND NUNS.
1.
The confessors and preachers must guard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> against offending the nuns
and occasioning temptations contrary to their vocation; but on the contrary, having
conciliated the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of the Lady Superiors, that we obtain to hear, when less, their
extraordinary confessions, and that it is predicted that we may hope soon to receive some
gratitude from them; because the abbesses, principally the rich and noble, can be of much
utility to the Society, by themselves, and by their relatives and friends; of the manner with
which we treat with them and influence of the principal monasteries, the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> will little
by little arrive to obtain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of all the corporation and increase its friendship.
2.
It will be necessary, notwithstanding, to prohibit our nuns from frequenting the
monasteries of women, for <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> that their mode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> may be more agreeable, and that the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> will see itself frustrated in the hopes of possessing all their properties. We must
induce them to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the vow of chastity and obedience, at the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of their confessors;

With the end of preventing the seculars from directing attention to our itching
for riches, it will be useful to repel at times alms of little amount, by which we can allow
them to do services for our Society; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we must accept the smallest amounts from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> attached to us, for <span class="t28 hoverable">fear</span> that we may be accused of avarice, if we only receive those
that are most numerous.
2.
We must refuse sepulture to persons of the lowest class in our churches,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they may have been very attached to our Society; for we do not believe that we
must seek riches by the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of interments, and we must hold firmly the gains that we
have made with the dead.
3.
In regard to the widows and other persons who have <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> their properties to the
Society, we must labor with resolution and greater vigor than with the others; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> being
equal, and not to be made apparent, that we favor some more than others, in
consideration of their temporal properties. The same must be observed with those that
pertain to the Society, after that they have made cession of their property; and if it be
necessary to expel them from the Society, it must be done with discretion, to the end that
they leave to the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> a part for the less of that which they have given, or that which
they have bequeathed at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of their death.

METHODS TO EXALT THE COMPANY.

Treating principally all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of little consequence, we must have
the same opinion, or at least exterior dignity; for by this manner we may augment and
strengthen the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> more and more; to overthrow the barrier we have overcome in the
business of the world.

all classes of studies.

We must inculcate this doctrine with kings and princes, THAT THE CATHOLIC

We must entertain their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will, by writing from all parts interesting facts and

It will be no little advantage that will result, by secretly and prudently
fomenting dissensions between the great, ruining or augmenting their power. But if we
perceive some appearance of reconciliation between them, then we of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> will
treat and act as pacificators; that it shall not be that any others shall anticipate to obtain it.
6.
As much to the magnates as to the people, we must persuade them by all
possible means, that the <span class="t1 hoverable">Society</span> has not been, but by especial <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Providence,

Having acquired the favor of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and of the bishops, it will be an entire
necessity, of empowering the curates and prebendaries to more exactly reform the clergy,
that in other times lived under certain rule with the bishops, and tending to perfection; also
it will be necessary to inspire the abbeys and prefaces; the which it will not be difficult to
obtain; calling attention to the indolence and stupidity of the monks as if they were cattle;
because it will be very advantageous for the Church, if all the bishoprics were occupied by
members of the Society; and yet, as if it was the same apostolic chair, particularly if the
Pope should return as temporal prince of all the properties; for as much as it is very
necessary to extend little by little, with much secrecy and skill, the temporalities of the
Society; and not having any doubt that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will enter the golden age, to enjoy a

But if we do not hope that we can obtain this, supposing that it is necessary
that scandals shall come in the world, WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO CHANGE OUR
POLITICS, CONFORMING TO THE TIMES, AND EXCITE THE PRINCES, FRIENDS OF
OURS TO mutually make terrible wars THAT EVERYWHERE THE MEDIATION OF THE
<span class="t1 hoverable">SOCIETY</span> WILL BE IMPLORED; that we may be employed in the public reconciliation, for
it will be the cause of the common good; and we shall be recompensed by the PRINCIPAL
