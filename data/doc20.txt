THE KITAB-I-AQDAS

PREFACE

In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith, included as one of the goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas as an essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice decided that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages. It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> of Arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> will be published.

Following the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Baha’u’llah which are supplementary to the Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Book, and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.

Shoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas should be "copiously annotated". The policy followed in preparing the notes has been to concentrate on those points which might strike a non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various reasons, require elucidation or background information. They are not intended to be a comprehensive commentary on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> beyond these fundamental requirements.

The notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification, are numbered sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> to which it relates, and indicates the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of the paragraph in which this appears. This facilitates cross-reference between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> and the notes, while making it possible for readers to study the notes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> repeatedly consulting the text, if they so prefer. It is hoped in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to meet the needs of readers of a wide range of backgrounds and interests.

The index provides a guide to subjects in all sections of the volume.

The significance and character of the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the range of subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi in his history of the first Baha’i century entitled <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Passes By. As an assistance to the reader, these passages are provided in the section that immediately follows the introduction. The Synopsis and Codification, which is republished in this volume, serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the Book.

INTRODUCTION

This year, the 149th of the Baha’i era, marks the Centenary of the Ascension of Baha’u’llah, Bearer of the universal Revelation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> destined to lead humanity to its collective coming of age. That this occasion should be observed by a community of believers representing a cross-section of the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race and established, in the course of a century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is a token of the forces of unity released by Baha’u’llah’s advent. A further testimony to the operation of these same forces can be seen in the extent to which Baha’u’llah’s vision has prefigured contemporary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> experience in so many of its aspects. It is a propitious moment for the publication of this first authorized translation into English of the Mother <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of His Revelation, His "Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Book", the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> in which He sets forth the Laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for a Dispensation destined to endure for no less than a <span class="t15 t23 hoverable">thousand</span> years.

Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings of Baha’u’llah, the Kitab-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. "To build anew the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world" is the claim and challenge of His Message, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> civilization that Baha’u’llah has come to raise up. Its provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past religions, for, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of Baha’u’llah, "This is the changeless <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> of God, <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> in the past, <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> in the future." In this Revelation the concepts of the past are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to a new level of understanding, and the social laws, changed to suit the age now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> civilization the splendours of which can as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> be scarcely imagined.

In its affirmation of the validity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religions of the past, the Kitab-i-Aqdas reiterates those <span class="t20 hoverable">eternal</span> truths enunciated by all the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Messengers: the unity of God, <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of one’s neighbour, and the moral purpose of earthly life. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute obstacles to the emerging unification of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the reconstruction of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> society.

There are laws in the Kitab-i-Aqdas which are directed primarily to the members of a specific section of humanity and can be immediately understood by them but which, at first reading, may be obscure to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of a different culture.

Nevertheless, although certain ordinances of the Aqdas have such a focused reference, they also have universal implications. Through His Law, Baha’u’llah gradually unveils the significance of the new levels of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and behaviour to which the peoples of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are being called.

The <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of this is that the times never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality and an essential attribute of this world, and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and place. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> action accordingly...

Briefly, this is the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of referring the laws of <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice. In the religion of Islam, similarly, not every ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth part was included in the Text; although all matters of major importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by the divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced. Today this process of deduction is the right of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice.

The <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed will come only gradually into being, and Baha’u’llah has provided for the progressive application of Baha’i law:

Indeed, the laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> are like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the ocean and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them one must exercise tact and wisdom...

One must guide mankind to the ocean of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> understanding in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and tolerance. The Kitab-i-Aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of God.

The principle governing this progressive application was enunciated in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Assembly in 1935: The laws revealed by Baha’u’llah in the Aqdas are, whenever practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of the land, absolutely binding on every believer or Baha’i institution <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> in the East or in the West.

Others have been formulated in anticipation of a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today...

What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by Baha’u’llah, will have to be enacted by the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice.

Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book.

The <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of laws binding on Baha’is is not increased by the publication of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Baha’i community will be advised which additional laws are binding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> believers, and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary for their application will be provided.

In general, the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An example of this conciseness can be seen in the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that many are expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the Guardian’s writings that, where Baha’u’llah has given a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> as between a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and a woman, it applies mutatis mutandis between a woman and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> unless the context makes this impossible.

Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Books of previous Dispensations. Especially close is the relationship to the Bayan, the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Laws revealed by the Bab. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from letters <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on behalf of the Guardian:

Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Baha’i Revelation as one complete <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> embracing the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> of the Bab should be emphasized... The <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> of the Bab should not be divorced from that of Baha’u’llah. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> the teachings of the Bayan have been abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> due to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Bab considered Himself as the Forerunner of Baha’u’llah, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> regard His Dispensation <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t9 t11 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> with that of Baha’u’llah as forming one entity, the former being introductory to the advent of the latter.

The Bab states that His laws are provisional and depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the acceptance of the future Manifestation.

This is why in the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Aqdas Baha’u’llah sanctions some of the laws found in the Bayan, modifies others and sets aside many. Just as the Bayan had been revealed by the Bab at about the mid-point of His Ministry, Baha’u’llah revealed the Kitab-i-Aqdas around 1873, some twenty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after He had received, in the Siyah-Chal of Tihran, the intimation of His Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> before it was sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has related:

The formulation by Baha’u’llah, in His Kitab-i-Aqdas, of the fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings, and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the provisions of His Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Book. These were recorded in unnumbered Tablets, which He continued to reveal until the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> of His earthly life...

Among such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t29 hoverable">works</span> is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, the most eminent of the transcribers of Baha’u’llah’s Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by Baha’u’llah to questions put to Him by various believers, it constitutes an invaluable appendix to the Kitab-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> were published in English as a compilation entitled Tablets of Baha’u’llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas.

Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> after the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha’u’llah had manuscript copies sent to Baha’is in Iran, and in the year 1308 A.H. (1890-91 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged for the publication of the original Arabic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> in Bombay.

A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> should be said about the style of language in which the Kitab-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Baha’u’llah enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and preferred to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> it in those Tablets and other Writings where its precision of <span class="t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> was particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of language itself, however, the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling, particularly to those familiar with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> literary tradition out of which it arose. In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the challenge of finding an English style which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text’s meaning, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also evoke in the reader the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of meditative reverence which is a distinguishing feature of response to the original. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of expression he selected, reminiscent of the style <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by the seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated mode of Baha’u’llah’s Arabic, while remaining accessible to the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.

Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies and varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one another. The Arabic of the Kitab-i-Aqdas is marked by intense concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated. This presents a problem for a reader <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> cultural, religious and literary background is entirely different from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> which is clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> becomes necessary to include in the English translation of such passages that element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this process to the point where it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> add unjustifiably to the original or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other, is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings different from those of similar terms in English.

Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in translation. This is supremely important in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> has been a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the utmost difficulty, requiring consultation with experts in many lands. Since some one <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary to strive for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> qualities in the translation of the remaining passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of style with that <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> by Shoghi Effendi.

We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where it represents an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless, it will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may shed further <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on its content. We are profoundly grateful for the assiduous and meticulous labours of the members of the Committees whom we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas and to compose the annotations. We are confident that this first authorized English edition of the Kitab-i-Aqdas will enable its readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendour of the Mother <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of the Baha’i Dispensation.

Our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> has entered the dark <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heart</span> of an age of fundamental change beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of whatever race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Baha’u’llah’s words: "The well-being of mankind, its <span class="t13 hoverable">peace</span> and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established." May the publication of this translation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas lend a fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision, opening vistas of a worldwide regeneration.

NOTES

1. the sweet-smelling savour of My garment # 4

This is an allusion to the story of Joseph in the Qur’an and the Old Testament, in which Joseph’s garment, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t19 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">brought</span> by his brothers to Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob to identify his beloved long-lost son. The metaphor of the fragrant "garment" is frequently <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the Baha’i Writings to refer to the recognition of the Manifestation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His Revelation.

Baha’u’llah, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the "Divine Joseph" Who has been "bartered away" by the heedless "for the most paltry of prices". The Bab, in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’, identifies Baha’u’llah as the "true Joseph" and forecasts the ordeals that He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> endure at the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> of His treacherous brother (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 190). Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense jealousy which the preeminence of Abdu’l-Baha had aroused in His half-brother, Mirza Muhammad-‘Ali, and the deadly envy "which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts of his brothers".

2. We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. # 5

The consumption of wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kitab-i-Aqdas (see notes 144 and 170).

Reference to the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of "wine" in an allegorical sense—such as being the cause of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ecstasy—is found, not only in the Revelation of Baha’u’llah, but in the Bible, in the Qur’an, and in ancient Hindu traditions.

For example, in the Qur’an the righteous are promised that they will be given to drink of the "choice sealed wine". In His Tablets, Baha’u’llah identifies the "choice Wine" with His Revelation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> "musk-laden fragrance" has been wafted "upon all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> things". He states that He has "unsealed" this "Wine", thereby disclosing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who quaff <span class="t23 t28 hoverable">thereof</span> to "discern the splendours of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> unity" and to "grasp the essential purpose underlying the Scriptures of God". In one of His meditations, Baha’u’llah entreats <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to supply the believers with "the choice Wine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> mercy, that it may cause them to be forgetful of any one except Thee, and to arise to serve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thy</span> Cause, and to be steadfast in their <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for Thee".

To differentiate this category of prayers from other kinds, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> has been translated as "obligatory prayer".

Baha’u’llah states that "obligatory prayer and fasting occupy an exalted station in the sight of God" (Q and A 93). Abdu’l-Baha affirms that such prayers are "conducive to humility and submissiveness, to setting one’s face towards <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and expressing devotion to Him", and that through these prayers "man holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Him, converseth with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Beloved of his heart, and attaineth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> stations".

4. nine rak’ahs # 6

A rak’ah is the recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a prescribed <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> of genuflections and other movements.

The Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Baha’u’llah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> His followers consisted of nine rak’ahs. The precise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown, as the prayer has been lost. (See <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 9.)

In a <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">Tablet</span> commenting on the presently-binding Obligatory Prayers, Abdu’l-Baha indicates that "in every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> and movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and a <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls cannot contain".

Shoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by Baha’u’llah for the recital of certain prayers not only have a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> significance but that they also help the individual "to fully concentrate when praying and meditating". 5. at noon and in the morning and the evening # 6 Regarding the definition of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> "morning", "noon" and "evening", at which times the currently binding medium Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Baha’u’llah has stated that these coincide with "sunrise, noon and sunset" (Q and A 83). He specifies that the "allowable times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon till sunset, and from sunset till <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> hours thereafter". Further, Abdu’l-Baha has stated that the morning Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.

The definition of "noon" as the period "from noon till sunset" applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory Prayer as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the medium one.

6. We have relieved you of a greater <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> # 6

The requirements for obligatory prayer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> for in the Babi and Islamic Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak’ahs that was prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 4).

In the Bayan, the Bab prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of nineteen rak’ahs which was to be performed once in a twenty-four-hour period—from noon of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to noon of the next.

The Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night. While the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of rak’ahs varies according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of recitation, a total of seventeen rak’ahs are offered in the course of a day.

7. When ye <span class="t3 t8 t9 t10 t11 t18 t19 t20 hoverable">desire</span> to perform this prayer, turn ye towards the Court of My Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Presence, this Hallowed Spot that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> ... decreed to be the Point of Adoration for the denizens of the Cities of Eternity # 6

The "Point of Adoration", that is, the point to which the worshipper should turn when <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> obligatory prayer, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the Qiblih. The concept of Qiblih has existed in previous religions. <span class="t28 hoverable">Jerusalem</span> in the past had been fixed for this purpose. Muhammad changed the Qiblih to Mecca.

The Bab’s instructions in the Arabic Bayan were:

The Qiblih is indeed He Whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest. This <span class="t26 hoverable">passage</span> is quoted by Baha’u’llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas (# 137) and confirmed by Him in the above-noted verse. He has also indicated that facing in the direction of the Qiblih is a "fixed requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer" (Q and A 14 and 67). However, for other prayers and devotions the individual may face in any direction.

8. and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that We have ordained for you # 6

Baha’u’llah ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Tomb is at Bahji, Akka. Abdu’l-Baha describes that Spot as the "luminous Shrine", "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> around which circumambulate the Concourse on High". In a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi uses the analogy of the plant turning in the direction of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> to explain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> significance of turning towards the Qiblih:

...just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight—from which it receives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and growth—so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation of God, Baha’u’llah, when we pray;

... we turn our faces ... to where His dust lies on this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> as a symbol of the inner act.

The original Obligatory Prayer had "for reasons of wisdom" been revealed by Baha’u’llah in a separate <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">Tablet</span> (Q and A 63). It was not released to the believers in His lifetime, having been superseded by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Obligatory Prayers now in use. Shortly after the Ascension of Baha’u’llah, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">text</span> of this prayer, along with a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of other Tablets, was stolen by Muhammad-‘Ali, the Arch-breaker of His Covenant.

10. the Prayer for the Dead # 8

The Prayer for the Dead (see Some <span class="t1 t2 t5 t10 t25 hoverable">Texts</span> Supplementary to the Kitab-i-Aqdas) is the only Baha’i obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in silence (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 19). Baha’u’llah has clarified that the Prayer for the Dead is required only when the deceased is an adult (Q and A 70), that the recital should precede the interment of the deceased, and that there is no requirement to face the Qiblih when saying this prayer (Q and A 85).

Further details concerning the Prayer for the Dead are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A. 13.-14.

11. six specific passages have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses # 8

The passages that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> part of the Prayer for the Dead comprise the repetition of the greeting "Allah-u-Abha" (God is the All-Glorious) six times, each followed by nineteen repetitions of one of six specifically revealed verses. These verses are identical with those in the Prayer for the Dead revealed by the Bab in the Bayan. Baha’u’llah added a supplication to precede these passages.

12. Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> departed, such as bones and the like.

In some earlier religious Dispensations, the wearing of the hair of certain animals or having certain other objects on one’s <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> was held to invalidate one’s prayer. Baha’u’llah here confirms the Bab’s pronouncement in the Arabic Bayan that such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> do not invalidate one’s prayer.

13. We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity # 10

Baha’u’llah defines the "age of maturity with respect to religious duties" as "fifteen for both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women" (Q and A 20). For details of the period of fasting, see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 25.

14. He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age # 10

The exemption of those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> the Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and Answers. Baha’u’llah indicates that in "time of ill-health it is not permissible to observe these obligations" (Q and A 93). He defines old age, in this context, as being from seventy (Q and A 74). In answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who attain the age of seventy are exempt, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> or not they are weak. Exemption from fasting is also granted to the other specific categories of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> listed in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.5. See notes 20, 30 and 31 for additional discussion.

The requirements of prayer in previous Dispensations have often included prostration. In the Arabic Bayan the Bab <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the believers to lay their foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating. Similarly, in Islam, certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface on which Muslims are permitted to prostrate. Baha’u’llah abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies "any surface that is clean".

16. Let him that findeth no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> for ablution repeat five times the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> "In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure", and then proceed to his devotions. # 10

Ablutions are to be performed by the believer in preparation for the <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> of obligatory prayer. They consist of washing the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and face. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is unavailable, the repetition five times of the specifically revealed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is prescribed.

The requirement of performing this prayer has been annulled.

The Prayer for the Dead (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 10) is the only congregational prayer prescribed by Baha’i law. It is to be recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party stands in silence; the reader has no special status. The congregation is not required to face the Qiblih (Q and A 85).

In this regard, Shoghi Effendi states that

Exemption from obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are menstruating; they should, instead, perform their ablutions (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 34) and repeat 95 times a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> between one noon and the next, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> "Glorified be God, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> of Splendour and Beauty". This provision has its antecedent in the Arabic Bayan, where a similar dispensation was granted.

In some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been abolished by Baha’u’llah (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 106).

Any believer is, therefore, <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to avail himself or herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice counsels that, in deciding <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> to do so or not, the believer should <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and realize that Baha’u’llah has granted these exemptions for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> reason.

The prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak’ahs, is now applicable to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> Obligatory Prayers which superseded it.

Exemption from obligatory prayer is granted to those who <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> themselves in such a condition of insecurity that the saying of the Obligatory Prayers is not possible. The exemption applies <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> one is travelling or at home, and it provides a means whereby Obligatory Prayers which have remained unsaid on <span class="t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t12 t16 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of these insecure circumstances may be compensated for.

Baha’u’llah has made it clear that obligatory prayer "is not suspended during travel" so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as one can <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> a "safe spot" in which to perform it (Q and A 58).

Numbers 21, 58, 59, 60, and 61 in Questions and Answers amplify this provision.

Shoghi Effendi indicates that the fasting period, which involves complete abstention from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and drink from sunrise till sunset, is

...essentially a period of <span class="t25 hoverable">meditation</span> and prayer, of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forces latent in his soul.

26. and at its close have designated for you Naw-Ruz as a feast # 16

The Bab introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badi’ or Baha’i calendar (see notes 27 and 147). According to this calendar, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is the period from sunset to sunset. In the Bayan, the Bab ordained the month of Ala’ to be the month of fasting, decreed that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of Naw-Ruz should mark the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Ruz as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> of God. Baha’u’llah confirms the Badi’ calendar wherein Naw-Ruz is designated as a feast.

Naw-Ruz is the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the new year. It coincides with the spring equinox in the northern hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21 March. Baha’u’llah explains that this feast <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> is to be celebrated on whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">sun</span> passes into the constellation of Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute before sunset (Q and A 35). Hence Naw-Ruz could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the equinox.

Among these are a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of matters affecting the Baha’i calendar. The Guardian has stated that the implementation, worldwide, of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> concerning the timing of Naw-Ruz will require the choice of a particular spot on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has been <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> to the decision of the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice.

The Badi’ calendar is based on the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd minutes. The year consists of 19 months of 19 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> each (i.e. 361 days), with the addition of four extra <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> (five in a leap year). The Bab did not specifically define the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> for the intercalary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> in the new calendar. The Kitab-i-Aqdas resolves this question by assigning the "excess" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">days</span> a fixed position in the calendar immediately preceding the month of Ala’, the period of fasting.

30. The traveller ... not bound by the Fast # 16 The minimum duration of a journey which exempts the believer from fasting is defined by Baha’u’llah (Q and A 22 and 75). The details of this provision are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.5.a.i.-v.

Shoghi Effendi has clarified that while travellers are exempt from fasting, they are <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to fast if they so wish. He also indicated that the exemption applies during the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> period of one’s travel, not just the hours one is in a train or car, etc.

32. Abstain from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and drink from sunrise to sundown # 17

This relates to the period of fasting. In one of His Tablets, Abdu’l-Baha, after stating that fasting consists of abstinence from <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and drink, further indicates that smoking is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of "drink".

In Islam there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was hidden. Baha’u’llah has confirmed that the Greatest Name is "Baha".

The various derivatives of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Baha" are also regarded as the Greatest Name. Shoghi Effendi’s secretary writing on his behalf explains that The Greatest Name is the Name of Baha’u’llah. "Ya Baha’u’l-Abha" is an invocation meaning: "O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thou</span> <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">Glory</span> of Glories!". "Allah-u-Abha" is a greeting which means:

"God the All-Glorious". Both refer to Baha’u’llah. By Greatest Name is meant that Baha’u’llah has appeared in God’s Greatest Name, in other words, that He is the supreme Manifestation of God.

The greeting "Allah-u-Abha" was adopted during the period of Baha’u’llah’s exile in Adrianople.

The repetition of "Allah-u-Abha" ninety-five times is to be preceded by the performance of ablutions (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 34).

Ablutions are specifically associated with certain prayers.

The prescribed ablutions consist of washing the <span class="t13 t23 hoverable">hands</span> and the face in preparation for prayer.

37. backbiting or calumny # 19

Backbiting, slander and dwelling on the faults of others have been repeatedly condemned by Baha’u’llah. In the Hidden Words, He clearly states: "O <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of Being!

In the Kitab-i-Aqdas (# 109), Baha’u’llah instructs every believer to write a will. He elsewhere clearly states that the individual has <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> jurisdiction over his property and is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and to designate, in the will, those, <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> Baha’i or non-Baha’i, who should inherit (Q and A 69). In this connection, a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains that:

The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the deceased’s estate among seven categories of heirs (children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on the provisions <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> out by the Bab in the Bayan. The major features of the Baha’i laws of inheritance in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of intestacy are:

1. If the deceased is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> and his estate includes a personal residence, such residence passes to the eldest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> (Q and A 34).

3. The remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of heirs.

4. In <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or female.

5. In cases where there is no issue, the share of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">children</span> reverts to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice (Q and A 7, 41).

6. Should one leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of heirs be non-existent, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> thirds of their shares revert to the offspring and one <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice (Q and A 7).

thirds of the estate revert to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist, the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t6 t7 t13 t14 t15 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sons</span> and daughters.

9. Baha’u’llah states that non-Baha’is have no right to inherit from their Baha’i parents or relatives (Q and A 34).

In a Tablet, Abdu’l-Baha compares teachers who are involved with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> education of the child to the "spiritual father" who "endoweth his child with everlasting life". He explains that this is the <span class="t1 t3 t8 t25 hoverable">reason</span> that "teachers are listed among the heirs" in the "Law of God".

Baha’u’llah specifies the conditions under which the teacher inherits and the share he or she receives (Q and A 33). 41.

Baha’u’llah doubled their portion to 1,080 shares and reduced those allotted to the other six categories of heirs. He also outlines the precise intention of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> and its implications for the distribution of the inheritance (Q and A 5).

44. We have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. # 25

In a Tablet, Abdu’l-Baha indicates that the residence and personal clothing of a deceased <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> remain in the male line.

He explains that this provision is an expression of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of primogeniture, which has invariably been upheld by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of God.

With the distinctions given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example, he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.

Baha’u’llah clarifies various aspects of this part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of inheritance.

This injunction has become the basis for the holding of monthly Baha’i festivities and as such constitutes the ordination of the Nineteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> Feast.

Baha’u’llah here confirms this and notes the unifying role of such occasions.

Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi after Him have gradually unfolded the institutional significance of this injunction. Abdu’l-Baha emphasized the importance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and devotional character of these gatherings. Shoghi Effendi, besides further elaborating the devotional and social aspects of the Feast, has developed the administrative element of such gatherings and, in systematically instituting the Feast, has provided for a period of consultation on the affairs of the Baha’i community, including the sharing of news and messages.

In answer to a question as to <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> this injunction is obligatory, Baha’u’llah stated it was not (Q and A 48). Shoghi Effendi in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf further comments:

Attendance at Nineteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> Feasts is not obligatory but very important, and every believer should consider it a duty and privilege to be present on such occasions.

83. If ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey, invoke ye the Name of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> when ye send them to pursue their quarry; for then whatever they catch shall be lawful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> you, even should ye <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it to have died. # 60

By this law, Baha’u’llah greatly simplifies practices and religious regulations of the past relating to hunting. He has also stated that hunting with such weapons as bows and arrows, guns, and the like, is included in this ruling, but that the consumption of game if it is found dead in a trap or a net is prohibited (Q and A 24).

84. hunt not to excess # 60

While hunting is not forbidden by Baha’u’llah, He warns against excessive hunting. The Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice will, in due course, have to consider what constitutes an excess in hunting.

85. He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> granted them no right to the property of others. # 61

The injunction to show kindness to Baha’u’llah’s kindred does not give them a share in the property of others. This is in contrast to Shi’ih Muslim practice, in which lineal descendants of Muhammad are entitled to receive a share of a certain tax.

86. Should anyone intentionally destroy a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> by fire, him also shall ye burn; should anyone deliberately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> another’s life, him also shall ye put to death. # 62

In His Tablets Abdu’l-Baha explains the difference between revenge and punishment. He affirms that individuals do not have the right to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> revenge, that revenge is despised in the <span class="t2 t7 t13 t14 t18 t22 t23 t24 hoverable">eyes</span> of God, and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance, but the imposition of a penalty for the committed offence. In Some Answered Questions, He confirms that it is the right of <span class="t1 hoverable">society</span> to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its members and defending its existence.

With regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf gives the following explanation:

In the Aqdas Baha’u’llah has given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> as the penalty for murder. However, He has permitted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> imprisonment as an alternative.

Some of us may not be able to grasp the <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> of this when it disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the salvation of the entire world. If a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> were falsely condemned to die, can we not believe Almighty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> compensate him a thousandfold, in the next world, for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> injustice?

Shoghi Effendi, in response to a question about this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> of the Aqdas, affirmed that while capital punishment is permitted, an alternative, "life imprisonment", has been provided "whereby the rigours of such a condemnation can be seriously mitigated".

Baha’u’llah, in one of His Tablets, states that God, in establishing this law, has made marriage "a fortress for well-being and salvation".

The Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.1.a.-o., summarizes and synthesizes the provisions in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and Questions and Answers concerning marriage and the conditions under which it is permitted (Q and A 3, 13, 46, 50, 84, and 92), the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of betrothal (Q and A 43), the payment of the dowry (Q and A 12, 26, 39, 47, 87, and 88), the procedures to be adopted in the event of the prolonged absence of a spouse (Q and A 4 and 27), and sundry other circumstances (Q and A 12 and 47).

In another Tablet, He underlines the importance of the individual’s acting in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> as to "bring comfort to himself and to his partner".

Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity. The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the <span class="t1 t3 t5 t16 t19 t25 hoverable">case</span> of fornication;

Muhammad limited the <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of wives to four, but making plurality of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for divorce; Baha’u’llah, Who was revealing His Teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of <span class="t12 t20 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">wisdom</span> and the progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that He <span class="t3 t13 t18 t24 hoverable">left</span> His followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him to outwardly permit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> wives in the Kitab-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled Abdu’l-Baha to elucidate later that the intention of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> was to enforce monogamy.

This was not permissible under Shi’ih Muslim practice unless the employer entered into a marriage contract with her. Baha’u’llah emphasizes that the "service" referred to in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> is solely "such as is performed by any other class of servants, be they young or old, in exchange for wages" (Q and A 30).

While marriage is enjoined in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha’u’llah clarifies that it is not obligatory (Q and A 46). Shoghi Effendi, in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf, also declared that "marriage is by no means an obligation", and he affirmed that "in the last resort, it is for the individual to decide <span class="t10 t12 t16 t20 t21 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whether</span> he wishes to lead a family <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> or live in a <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t16 t19 hoverable">state</span> of celibacy".

These provisions have their antecedents in the Bayan.

The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed at 19 mithqals of pure gold for city-dwellers, and 19 mithqals of silver for village-dwellers (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 94). Baha’u’llah indicates that, if, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the wedding, the bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for him to issue a promissory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> to the bride (Q and A 39).

With the Revelation of Baha’u’llah many familiar concepts, customs and institutions are redefined and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> on new meaning. One of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> a "bride-price". In both such cases the amount is often quite considerable. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Baha’u’llah abolishes all such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.

94. for city-dwellers at nineteen mithqals of pure gold, and for village-dwellers at the same amount in silver # 66

Baha’u’llah specifies that the criterion for determining the dowry payment is the location of the permanent residence of the bridegroom, not of the bride (Q and A 87, 88).

95. Whoso wisheth to increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety-five mithqals... If he content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest level, it shall be better for him according to the Book. # 66

In answer to a question about the dowry, Baha’u’llah stated:

Whatever is revealed in the Bayan, in respect to those residing in cities and villages, is approved and should be carried out. However, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas mention is made of the lowest level. The intention is nineteen mithqals of silver, specified in the Bayan for village-dwellers. This is more pleasing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> God, provided the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parties agree.

Therefore, the greater the consideration shown in these matters the better it will be... The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Baha must associate and deal with each other with the utmost <span class="t0 t2 t5 t7 t8 t13 t15 t17 t18 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> and sincerity. They should be mindful of the interests of all, especially the friends of God.

Abdu’l-Baha, in one of His Tablets, summarized some of the provisions for determining the level of the dowry. The unit of payment mentioned in the extract, cited below, is the "vahid". One vahid is equivalent to nineteen mithqals. He stated:

City-dwellers must pay in gold and village-dwellers in silver. It dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom. If he is poor, he payeth one vahid; if of modest means, he payeth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> vahids; if well-to-do, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> vahids; if wealthy, four vahids; and if very rich, he giveth five vahids. It is, in truth, a <span class="t25 hoverable">matter</span> for agreement between the bridegroom, the bride, and their parents. Whatever agreement is reached should be carried out. In this same Tablet, Abdu’l-Baha encouraged the believers to refer questions concerning the application of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> to the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice, which has "the authority to legislate".

If, however, the husband was unaware of the law, the wife must wait until news of her husband reaches her (Q and A 4).

97. it behoveth her to wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband # 67

In the event of the husband’s failure, either to return at the end of the specified period of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or to notify his wife of a delay, the wife must wait nine months, after which she is <span class="t8 t11 t14 t19 hoverable">free</span> to remarry, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it is preferable for her to wait longer (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 147 for the Baha’i calendar).

Baha’u’llah states that, in such circumstances, should news reach the wife of "her husband’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> or murder", she must also wait nine months, prior to remarrying (Q and A 27). Abdu’l-Baha, in a Tablet, has further clarified that the nine months’ waiting period following news of the husband’s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">death</span> applies only if the husband had been away at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of his death, and not if he dies while at home.

Baha’u’llah sets out "the criterion of justness" in relation to witnesses as "a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> reputation among the people". He states that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be Baha’is since "The testimony of all God’s servants, of whatever <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">faith</span> or creed, is acceptable before His Throne" (Q and A 79).

Divorce is strongly condemned in the Baha’i Teachings. If, however, antipathy or resentment develop between the marriage partners, divorce is permissible after the lapse of one <span class="t5 hoverable">full</span> year. During this year of patience, the husband is obliged to provide for the financial support of his wife and children, and the couple is urged to strive to reconcile their differences. Shoghi Effendi affirms that both the husband and wife "have equal right to ask for divorce" whenever either partner "feels it absolutely essential to do so". In Questions and Answers, Baha’u’llah elaborates a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of issues concerning the year of patience, its observance (Q and A 12), establishing the date of its beginning (Q and A 19 and 40), the conditions for reconciliation (Q and A 38), and the role of witnesses and the Local <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice (Q and A 73 and 98).

108. the Bayan # 77

The Bayan, the Mother <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of the Babi Dispensation, is the title given by the Bab to His <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Laws, and it is also applied to the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of His Writings. The Persian Bayan is the major doctrinal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and principal repository of the laws ordained by the Bab. The Arabic Bayan is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty. When describing the Persian Bayan in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Passes By Shoghi Effendi indicated that it should be regarded "primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than as a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future generations".

Abdu’l-Baha has written: "The Bayan <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been superseded by the Kitab-i-Aqdas, except in respect of such laws as have been confirmed and mentioned in the Kitab-i-Aqdas."

109. the destruction of books # 77

In the <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">Tablet</span> of Ishraqat Baha’u’llah, referring to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that the Bab had made the laws of the Bayan subject to His sanction, states that He put some of the Bab’s laws into effect "by embodying them in the Kitab-i-Aqdas in different words", while others He <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside.

With regard to the destruction of books, the Bayan commanded the Bab’s followers to destroy all books except those that were <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God. Baha’u’llah abrogates this specific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of the Bayan.

As to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and severity of the laws of the Bayan, Shoghi Effendi in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf provides the following comment:

The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Bab can be properly appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of His own statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own Dispensation.

Those drastic measures enforced by the Bab and His followers were <span class="t7 t10 t12 t26 hoverable">taken</span> with the <span class="t1 t2 t19 hoverable">view</span> of undermining the very foundations of Shi’ih orthodoxy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> paving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for the coming of Baha’u’llah. To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Baha’u’llah, the Bab had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> to reveal very severe laws, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> most of them were never enforced. But the mere <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that He revealed them was in itself a proof of the independent character of His Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation, and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.

In His Tablets Baha’u’llah counsels the believers to study such sciences and arts as are "useful" and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> further "the progress and advancement" of society, and He cautions against sciences which "begin with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and end with words", the pursuit of which leads to "idle disputation". Shoghi Effendi, in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf, likened sciences that "begin with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> and end with words" to "fruitless excursions into metaphysical hair-splittings", and, in another letter, he explained that what Baha’u’llah primarily intended by such "sciences" are "those theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> rather than help it to attain the truth".

129. the Mother <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> # 103

The term "Mother Book" is generally <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to designate the central <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of a religious Dispensation. In the Qur’an and Islamic Hadith, the term is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> to describe the Qur’an itself. In the Babi Dispensation, the Bayan is the Mother Book, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Mother <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of the Dispensation of Baha’u’llah. Further, the Guardian in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf has stated that this concept can also be <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> as a "collective term indicating the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the Teachings revealed by Baha’u’llah".

As explained in notes 145 and 184, Baha’u’llah designated Abdu’l-Baha, His eldest Son, as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. Abdu’l-Baha in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed Him as interpreter of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The interpretations of Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi are considered divinely guided and are binding on the Baha’is.

The <span class="t11 t16 hoverable">existence</span> of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear distinction is, however, drawn in the Baha’i Writings between authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the Teachings constitute the fruit of man’s rational <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views, nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas, individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear that their views are merely their own.

131. approach not the public pools of Persian baths # 106

Baha’u’llah prohibits the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the pools found in the traditional public bath-houses of Persia. In these baths it was the custom for many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to wash themselves in the same pool and for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> to be changed at infrequent intervals.

Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text, this does not mean that all other unions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">within</span> a family are permissible.

Shoghi Effendi, in letters <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf, states that this prohibition includes not only the consumption of wine but of "everything that deranges the mind", and he clarifies that the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of alcohol is permitted only when it constitutes part of a medical treatment which is implemented "under the advice of a competent and conscientious physician, who may have to prescribe it for the cure of some special ailment".

146. In the Bayan it had been forbidden you to ask Us questions. # 126

The Bab forbade His followers to ask questions of Him Whom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> will make manifest (Baha’u’llah), unless their questions were submitted in writing and pertained to subjects worthy of His lofty station. See Selections from the Writings of the Bab.

Baha’u’llah removes this prohibition of the Bab. He invites the believers to ask such questions as they "need to ask", and He cautions them to refrain from posing "idle questions" of the kind which preoccupied "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of former times".

Baha’u’llah, in quoting this law, points to the <span class="t24 hoverable">fact</span> that, in revealing it, the Bab had clearly anticipated the possibility that the Cause of Baha’u’llah <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> rise to prominence before that of the Bab Himself.

"Designedly severe in the rules and regulations it imposed," he continues, "revolutionizing in the principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Day</span> when ‘the Summoner shall summon to a stern business’, when He will ‘demolish whatever <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been before Him, even as the Apostle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> demolished the ways of those that preceded Him’" (see also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 109).

The Baha’i Writings contain many passages that elucidate the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Manifestation and His relationship to God. Baha’u’llah underlines the unique and transcendent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Godhead. He explains that "since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> with His creation" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> ordains that "in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Soul</span> be made manifest in the kingdoms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and heaven".

He is also endowed with a "double station":

The first station, which is related to His innermost reality, representeth Him as One <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Whose</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> is the <span class="t23 hoverable">voice</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> Himself... The <span class="t2 t3 t5 t10 t12 t18 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">second</span> station is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> station, exemplified by the following verses: "I am but a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> like you." "Say, praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?"

Baha’u’llah also affirms that, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> realm, there is an "essential unity" between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal the "Beauty of God", manifest His names and attributes, and give utterance to His Revelation.

In this regard, He states:

Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> to declare: "I am God", He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For it <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been repeatedly demonstrated that through their Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His names and His attributes, are made manifest in the world...

While the Manifestations reveal the names and attributes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and are the means by which humanity has access to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manifestations should "never ... be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself". In relation to Baha’u’llah, the Guardian wrote that the "human temple that has been the vehicle of so overpowering a Revelation" is not to be identified with the "Reality" of God.

Concerning the uniqueness of Baha’u’llah’s station and the greatness of His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the prophetic statements concerning the "Day of God", found in the Sacred Scriptures of past Dispensations, are fulfilled by the advent of Baha’u’llah:

To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Israel</span> He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the "Everlasting Father", the "Lord of Hosts" come down "with ten thousands of saints"; to Christendom <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t16 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Christ</span> returned "in the <span class="t0 t7 t21 t27 hoverable">glory</span> of the Father"; to Shi’ah Islam the return of the Imam Husayn; to Sunni Islam the descent of the "Spirit of God" (Jesus Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised Shah-Bahram; to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.

Baha’u’llah describes the station of "Divinity" which He shares with all the Manifestations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as ...the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in God. Divinity, whenever I mention it, indicateth My complete and absolute self-effacement. This is the station in which I have no control over mine own weal or woe nor over my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> nor over my resurrection.

And, regarding His own relationship to God, He testifies:

When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all <span class="t16 hoverable">created</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> "verily I am God"; and when I consider my own self, lo, I <span class="t11 t12 t22 t25 t27 hoverable">find</span> it coarser than clay!

161. payment of Zakat # 146

Zakat is referred to in the Qur’an as a regular charity binding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> Muslims. In due course the concept evolved into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">form</span> of alms-tax which imposed the obligation to give a fixed portion of certain categories of income, beyond specified limits, for the relief of the poor, for various charitable purposes, and to aid the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> of God. The limit of exemption varied for different commodities, as did the percentage payable on the portion assessable.

Baha’u’llah states that the Baha’i <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of Zakat follows "what <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been revealed in the Qur’an" (Q and A 107). Since such issues as the limits for exemption, the categories of income concerned, the frequency of payments, and the scale of rates for the various categories of Zakat are not mentioned in the Qur’an, these matters will have to be <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in the future by the Universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Justice. Shoghi Effendi has indicated that pending such legislation the believers should, according to their means and possibilities, make regular contributions to the Baha’i Fund.

He further points out in that same Tablet: "The <span class="t2 hoverable">object</span> is to uproot mendicancy altogether. However, if a <span class="t1 t8 t11 t16 t20 t21 t25 t29 hoverable">person</span> is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his subsistence...

163. A fine ... had formerly been prescribed ... for anyone who was the cause of sadness to another # 148

Baha’u’llah abrogates the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of the Persian Bayan concerning the payment of a fine in reparation for causing sadness to one’s neighbour.

164. the sacred Lote-Tree # 148

The "sacred Lote-Tree" is a reference to the Sadratu’l-Muntaha, the "Tree beyond which there is no passing" (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 128). It is <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> here symbolically to designate Baha’u’llah.

165. Recite ye the verses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> every morn and eventide. # 149

Baha’u’llah states that the essential "requisite" for reciting "the verses of God" is the "eagerness and love" of the believers to "read the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Word</span> of God" (Q and A 68).

With regard to the definition of "verses of God",

Baha’u’llah states that it refers to "all that <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been sent down from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Utterance". Shoghi Effendi, in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> to one of the believers in the East, has clarified that the term "verses of God" does not include the writings of Abdu’l-Baha; he has likewise indicated that this term does not apply to his own writings.

166. Ye have been enjoined to renew the furnishings of your homes after the passing of each nineteen <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> # 151

Baha’u’llah confirms the injunction in the Arabic Bayan regarding the renewal, every nineteen years, of the furnishings of one’s home, provided one is able to do so. Abdu’l-Baha relates this ordinance to the promotion of refinement and cleanliness. He explains that the purpose of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> is that one should change those furnishings that become old, lose their lustre and provoke repugnance. It does not apply to such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as rare or treasured articles, antiques or jewellery.

167. Wash your feet # 152

The believers are exhorted in the Kitab-i-Aqdas to bathe regularly, to wear clean clothes and generally to be the essence of cleanliness and refinement. The Synopsis and Codification, section IV.D.3.y.i.-vii., summarizes the relevant provisions. In relation to the washing of the feet, Baha’u’llah states that it is preferable to <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> warm water; however, washing in cold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> is also permissible (Q and A 97).

168. Ye have been prohibited from making <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of pulpits.

These provisions have their antecedent in the Persian Bayan. The Bab forbade the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of pulpits for the delivery of sermons and the reading of the Text. He specified, instead, that to enable all to hear the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Word</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> clearly, a chair for the speaker should be placed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a platform.

In one of His Tablets, when reiterating the prohibition of the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of pulpits in any location, Abdu’l-Baha has stressed that when Baha’is deliver their speeches in gatherings, they are to do so in an attitude of utmost humility and self-abnegation.

170. the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of opium ... any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor # 155

This prohibition of the <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of opium is reiterated by Baha’u’llah in the final paragraph of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. In this connection, Shoghi Effendi stated that one of the requirements for "a chaste and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> life" is "total abstinence ... from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs".

O ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence and force, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned.

And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his duty to his Lord.

In one of His Tablets Abdu’l-Baha has stated concerning opium: "the user, the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and grace of God".

The name for the letter "Vav" consists of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> letters: Vav, Alif, Vav. According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf to one of the believers in the East provides an interpretation of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">verse</span> of the Aqdas. He states that the "Upright Alif" refers to the advent of the Bab. The first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the Bab, while the <span class="t7 hoverable">third</span> letter, which also has a numerical value of six, stands for Baha’u’llah’s supreme Revelation which was made manifest after the Alif.

Baha’u’llah confirms an injunction contained in the Bayan which makes it unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be "essential" for an individual, Abdu’l-Baha gives permission to a believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi Effendi in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf has also indicated that, in an emergency, when there is no legal force at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> to appeal to, a Baha’i is justified in defending his life. There are a <span class="t3 t17 t26 hoverable">number</span> of other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately used; for instance, in countries where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> hunt for their <span class="t2 t4 t11 t13 hoverable">food</span> and clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.

In the <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">Tablet</span> of Bisharat, Baha’u’llah expresses the hope that "weapons of war throughout the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men".

In another <span class="t4 t9 t12 t24 t26 hoverable">Tablet</span> Baha’u’llah stresses the importance of fellowship with the followers of all religions; He also states that "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">law</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">holy</span> war <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> been blotted out from the Book".

Many rules about dress had their origins in the laws and traditional practices of the world’s religions. For example, the Shi’ih clergy adopted for themselves a distinctive headdress and robes and, at one time, forbade the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to adopt European attire.

Baha’u’llah removed such limitations on one’s apparel and beard.

He actively opposed both the Bab and Baha’u’llah, and <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> his treatises to attack the Bab and His Teachings.

This is a reference to Mirza Yahya, known as Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity), a younger half-brother of Baha’u’llah, who arose against Him and opposed His Cause. Mirza Yahya was nominated by the Bab to serve as a figure-head for the Babi community pending the imminent manifestation of the Promised One. At the instigation of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 192), Mirza Yahya betrayed the trust of the Bab, claimed to be His successor, and intrigued against Baha’u’llah, even attempting to have Him murdered. When Baha’u’llah formally declared His Mission to him in Adrianople, Mirza Yahya responded by going to the length of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an independent Revelation. His pretensions were eventually rejected by all but a few, who became known as Azalis (see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> 177).

The first sign of the coming of age of humanity referred to in the Writings of Baha’u’llah is the emergence of a science which is described as that "divine philosophy" which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements. This is an indication of the splendours of the future stupendous expansion of knowledge. Concerning the "second" sign which Baha’u’llah indicates to have been revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi states that Baha’u’llah, "...in His Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Holy</span> Book, has enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> to use, an injunction which, when carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the signs of the ‘coming of age of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">human</span> race’".

It is the Greatest Name of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and a title by which Baha’u’llah is designated.

Baha’u’llah

The "Glory of God", title of Mirza Husayn-‘Ali (1817-1892), the Founder of the Baha’i Faith.

Bayan

The Bayan ("Exposition") is the title given by the Bab to His <span class="t1 t4 t7 t15 t18 t20 t27 hoverable">Book</span> of Laws, and it is also applied to the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of His Writings. The Persian Bayan is the major doctrinal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and principal repository of the laws ordained by the Bab. The Arabic Bayan is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty. References in the annotations to subjects found in both the Persian Bayan and the Arabic Bayan are identified by <span class="t4 t18 hoverable">use</span> of the term "Bayan" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> further qualification.

Huququ’llah

The "Right of God". Instituted in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, it is an <span class="t22 t23 t28 hoverable">offering</span> made by the Baha’is through the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">Head</span> of the <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> for the purposes specified in the Baha’i Writings.

Mashriqu’l-Adhkar

Literally "the Dawning-place of the praise of God", the designation of the Baha’i <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Worship and its dependencies.

Mithqal

A unit of weight, equivalent to a little over 3 ½ grammes, <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the Kitab-i-Aqdas with reference to quantities of gold or silver for various purposes, usually in amounts of 9, 19 or 95 mithqals. The equivalents of these in the metric system and in troy ounces (which are <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the measurement of precious metals), are as follows:

9 mithqals = 32.775 grammes = 1.05374 troy ounces 19 mithqals = 69.192 grammes = 2.22456 troy ounces 95 mithqals = 345.958 grammes = 11.12282 troy ounces This computation is based on the guidance of Shoghi Effendi, conveyed in a letter <span class="t0 t11 t24 hoverable">written</span> on his behalf, which states "one mithqal consists of nineteen nakhuds. The weight of twenty-four nakhuds equals four and three-fifths grammes. Calculations may be made on this basis." The mithqal traditionally <span class="t4 hoverable">used</span> in the Middle East had consisted of 24 nakhuds but in the Bayan this was changed to 19 nakhuds and Baha’u’llah confirmed this as the size of the mithqal referred to in the Baha’i laws (Q and A 23).

Nakhud

A unit of weight. See "mithqal".

Qayyumu’l-Asma’

Shoghi Effendi

Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957), Guardian of the Baha’i <span class="t4 t7 t12 t16 hoverable">Faith</span> from 1921-1957. He was the eldest grandson of Abdu’l-Baha and was appointed by Him as the <span class="t7 t11 t15 t22 hoverable">Head</span> of the Faith.
