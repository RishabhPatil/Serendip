I shall now make. The communications it contains concerning the

First of all, something is to be offered those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who feel drawn to
the results of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> research, and who must raise the question:
“Well, whence do these persons derive their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> who claim the
ability to tell us something of the profound riddles of life?” — <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span>
science does this. Whoever wishes to observe the facts leading to such
claims must rise to supersensible cognition. He must follow the path I
have endeavored to describe in this book. On the other hand, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be an error to imagine these disclosures of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science to be
valueless for one who lacks the inclination or the possibility to pursue
this path himself. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to establish the facts through research, the
ability to enter the supersensible worlds is indispensable; but once they
have been discovered and communicated, even one who does not
perceive them himself can be adequately convinced of their truth. A
large proportion of them can be tested offhand, simply by applying
ordinary common <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> in a genuinely unprejudiced way. Only, one
must not let this open-mindedness become confused by any of the preconceived ideas so common in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> life. Someone can easily believe,
for example, that some statement or other contradicts certain facts
established by modern science. In reality, there is no such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as a
scientific <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that contradicts <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science; but there can easily
seem to be contradictions unless scientific conclusions are consulted
abundantly and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> prejudice. The student will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the more
open-mindedly he compares <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science with positive scientific
achievements, the more clearly is complete accord to be seen.
Another category of spiritual-scientific disclosures, it is true, will be
found to elude purely mental judgment more or less; but the right
relation to these also will be achieved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> difficulty by one
who understands that not the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> alone but healthy feeling as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> is
qualified to determine what is true. And when this feeling does not
permit itself to be warped by a liking or antipathy for some opinion or

other, but really allows <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> prejudice, a
corresponding sentient judgment results.
And there are many more ways of confirming this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> for those
who cannot or do not wish to tread the path into the supersensible
world. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> can feel very clearly what value this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> has
in life, even when it comes to them only through the communications
of those engaged in <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> research. Not everyone can immediately
achieve <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision; but the discoveries of those who have it can be
health-giving life-nourishment for all. For everyone can apply them;
and whoever does so will soon discover what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in every branch can
be with their aid, and what it lacks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> them. The results of
supersensible knowledge, when properly employed in life, prove to be
— not unpractical, but rather, practical in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> sense.
One who does not himself intend to follow the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge, but is interested in the facts it reveals, can ask: How does
the seer arrive at these facts? To such a one this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> is intended to
picture the path in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that even one not following it can
nevertheless have confidence in the communications of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who
has done so . Realizing how the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist works, he can
approve, and say to himself: The impression made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> me by the
description of this path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds makes clear why the facts
reported seem reasonable. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> is intended to help those who
want their <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and feeling for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> concerning the

No less, however, does it aim to offer aid to those who themselves seek
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to supersensible knowledge. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of what is here <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth

Anyone with this intention will do <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> to keep reminding himself that
in an exposition on the development of the soul, more is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> for than
becoming acquainted with the substance, which is frequently the aim in
other expositions. It is necessary to familiarize oneself intimately with
the presentation. One must postulate the following: no single matter is
to be comprehended only by means of what is said about the matter
itself, but by means of much else that is disclosed concerning totally
different matters. This will develop the conception that what is vital is
to be found not in any single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> but in the harmony of all truths. This
must be seriously considered by anyone intending to carry out the
exercises. An exercise can be rightly understood and even rightly
executed, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> produce a wrong effect unless another be added to it
— one that will resolve the one-sidedness of the first into a harmony of
the soul. Whoever reads this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> in an intimate way, so that the
reading resembles an inner experience, will not merely familiarize
himself with its content: one <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> will evoke a certain feeling,

5

another <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> another feeling; and in that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he will learn how
much importance should be seen in the one or the other in the
development of his soul. He will also <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> out in what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> he should
try this or that exercise, what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> best suits his particular
individuality. When one has to do, as is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> here, with descriptions
of processes that are to be experienced, it is necessary to refer again
and again to the content; for it will become manifest that much can be
satisfactorily assimilated only after trial, which in turn reveals certain
finer points that at first are bound to be overlooked.
Even those readers who do not intend to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> prescribed will
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> much in the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> that can be of service to the inner life, such as
maxims, suggestions that throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on various puzzling problems,
and so on.
And those who have had experiences in their lives that serve, to some
extent, as an initiation through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> may derived a certain satisfaction
from finding clarified through co-ordination what had haunted them as
separate problems — <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> they already knew, but perhaps <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

Preface to the Fifth Edition
In preparing this new edition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Worlds
and Its Attainment I have gone over every detail of the subject as I had
presented it over ten <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago. The urge to make such a review is
natural in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of disclosures concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> experiences and paths
such as are indicated in this book. There can be no portion of what is
imparted which does not remain intimately a part of the one who
communicates it, or which does not contain something that perpetually
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his soul. And it is inevitable that this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
should be joined by an endeavor to enhance the clarity and lucidity of
the presentation as given <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> before. This engendered what I have
endeavored to accomplish in this new edition. All the essential
elements of the expositions, all the principal points, have remained as
they were; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> important changes have been made. In many passages I
have been able to increase the accuracy of characterization in detail,
and this seemed to me important. If anyone wishes to apply what is
imparted in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> to his own <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, it is important that he
should be able to contemplate the paths in question by means of a
characterization as exact as possible. Misconceptions can arise in far
greater measure in connection with the description of inner <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
processes than with that of facts in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. The mobility of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> life, the danger of losing sight of how different it is from all
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> — this and much else renders such
misunderstandings possible. In preparing this new edition I have
directed my attention to finding passages in which misconceptions
might arise, and I have endeavored to forestall them.
At the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I wrote the essays that constitute this book, much had
to be discussed in a different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from today, because at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> I
had to allude in a different manner to the substance of what had been
published since then concerning facts of cognition of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
worlds. In my Occult Science, in The <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Guidance of Mankind,
in A Road to Self-Knowledge and the Threshold of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> World,
as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in other writings, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> processes are described <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
existence, to be sure, was already inevitably indicated in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> ten
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, but in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> differing from those that seem right today. In
connection with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal not described in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> I had to explain
at that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that it could be learned by oral communication. Much of
what this referred to has since been published. But these allusions
perhaps did not wholly exclude the possibility of erroneous ideas in the
reader's mind. It might be possible, for instance, to imagine that
something much more vital in the personal relations between the seeker
for <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> schooling and this or that teacher than is intended. I trust I
have here succeeded, by presenting details in a certain way, in

emphasizing more strongly that for one seeking <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> schooling in
accord with present <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> conditions an absolutely direct relation to

to the personality of a teacher. The latter will gradually become merely
the helper; he will assume the same position in <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> schooling as a
teacher occupies, in conformity with modern views, in any other field
of knowledge. I believe I have sufficiently stressed the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the
teacher's authority and the pupil's <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in him should play no greater
part in <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> schooling than in any other branch of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or

research and those who develop an interest in the results of his

A <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> part is to be added to this first part, bringing further

Preface to the Edition of May 1918
In working over this new edition I found only minor changes in its
substance necessary; but I have added an appendix in which I have
endeavored to explain more clearly the psychological foundations to
which the disclosures contained in the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> must be traced if they are to
be accepted <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> risk of misunderstanding. I believe that the contents
of the appendix will also serve to show many an opponent of
anthroposophical <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science that his judgment is based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a
misconception of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science; that he does not see

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which to build. Only it must not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that this disposition leads
to submissiveness and slavery. What was once a childlike veneration for
persons becomes, later, a veneration for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and knowledge. Experience
teaches that they can best hold their heads erect who have learnt to
venerate where veneration is due; and veneration is always fitting when it
flows from the depths of the heart.
If we do not develop <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> ourselves this deeply rooted feeling that there
is something <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than ourselves, we shall never <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the strength to
evolve to something higher. The initiate has only acquired the strength to
lift his <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to the heights of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by guiding his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> to the depths
of veneration and devotion. The heights of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> can only be climbed
by passing through the portals of humility. You can only acquire right

to turn his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> to the light, but he must first acquire this right. There are
laws in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life, as in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. Rub a glass rod with an
appropriate material and it will become electric, that is, it will receive the

This is in keeping with a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of nature. It
is known to all who have learnt a little physics. Similarly, acquaintance
with the first principles of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science shows that every feeling of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>

later, lead further on the path of knowledge.
The student who is gifted with this feeling, or who is fortunate enough to
have had it inculcated in a suitable education, brings a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal along
with him when, later in life, he seeks admittance to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge.
Failing such preparation, he will encounter difficulties at the very first
step, unless he undertakes, by rigorous self-education, to create <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>

In our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is especially important
that <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> attention be paid to this point. Our civilization tends more toward
critical judgment and condemnation than toward devotion and selfless
veneration. Our <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">children</span> already criticize far more than they worship. But
every criticism, every adverse judgment passed, disperses the powers of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the same measure that
all veneration and reverence develops them. In this we do not wish to say
anything against our civilization. There is no question here of leveling
criticism against it. To this critical faculty, this self-conscious <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

greatness of our civilization. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> could never have attained to the science,

have thereby gained in external culture we have had to pay for with a
corresponding loss of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life. It must be
emphasized that <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is not concerned with the veneration of
persons but the veneration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and knowledge.
Now, the one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> that everyone must acknowledge is the difficulty for
those involved in the external civilization of our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to advance to the

They can only do so if they <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
energetically at themselves. At a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when the conditions of material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
were simpler, the attainment of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> was also easier.
Objects of veneration and <span class="t0 t5 t11 hoverable">worship</span> stood out in clearer relief from the
ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the world. In an epoch of criticism ideals are lowered;
other feelings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of veneration, respect, adoration, and wonder.
Our own age thrusts these feelings further and further into the background,
so that they can only be conveyed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> through his every-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in a
very small degree. Whoever seeks <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must create it for
himself. He must instill it into his soul. It cannot be done by study; it can
only be done through life. Whoever, therefore, wishes to become a student
of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must assiduously cultivate this inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of devotion.
Everywhere in his environment and his experiences he must seek motives
of admiration and homage. If I meet a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and blame him for his
shortcomings, I rob myself of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to attain <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge; but if I
try to enter lovingly into his merits, I gather such power. The student must
continually be intent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> following this advice. The spiritually
experienced know how much they owe to the circumstance that in <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of
all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> they ever again turn to the good, and withhold adverse
judgement. But this must not remain an external rule of life; rather it must
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> possession of our innermost soul. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has it in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to perfect
himself and, in time, completely to transform himself. But this
transformation must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in his innermost self, in his thought-life. It
is not enough that I show respect only in my outward bearing; I must have
this respect in my thoughts. The student must begin by absorbing this
devotion into this thought-life. He must be wary of thoughts of disrespect,
of adverse criticism, existing in his consciousness, and he must endeavor
straightaway to cultivate thoughts of devotion.
Every moment that we <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> ourselves to discover in our <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span>
whatever there remains in it of adverse, disparaging and critical judgement
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and of life; every such moment brings us nearer to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge. And we rise rapidly when we fill our <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> in such
moments with thoughts evoking in us admiration, respect and veneration
for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and for life.

begins to understand that hitherto he had only seen a part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> training is necessary. But he can rise to this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> training if he has
previously undergone a rigorous training in devotion. (In the last <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span>

Knowledge. No change need be noticed in the student. He performs his
duties as hitherto; he attends to his business as before. The transformation
goes on only in the inner part of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> hidden from outward sight. At
first his entire inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is flooded by this basic feeling of devotion for
everything which is truly venerable. His entire soul-life finds in this
fundamental feeling its pivot. Just as the sun's rays vivify everything
living, so does reverence in the student vivify all feelings of the soul.
It is not easy, at first, to believe that feelings like reverence and respect
have anything to do with cognition. This is due to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that we are
inclined to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> cognition aside as a faculty by itself — one that stands in no
relation to what otherwise occurs in the soul. In so thinking we do not bear
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which exercises the faculty of cognition; and
feelings are for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> what <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> is for the body. If we give the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

Veneration, homage, devotion are like nutriment making it healthy and
strong, especially strong for the activity of cognition. Disrespect,
antipathy, underestimation of what deserves recognition, all exert a
paralyzing and withering effect on this faculty of cognition. For the
spiritually experienced this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> is visible in the aura. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which harbors
feelings of reverence and devotion produces a change in its aura. Certain
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> colorings, as they may be called, yellow-red and brown-red in
tone, vanish and are replaced by blue-red tints. Thereby the cognitional
faculty is ripened; it receives <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> of facts in its environment of
which it had hitherto no idea. Reverence awakens in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> a
sympathetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> through which we attract qualities in the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> around

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> obtained through devotion can be rendered still more effective
when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of feeling is enriched by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> another quality. This consists in
giving oneself up less and less to impressions of the outer world, and to
develop instead a vivid inner life. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who darts from one impression
of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to another, who constantly seeks distraction, cannot <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>

outer world, but while lending himself to its impressions, he should be
directed by his rich inner life. When passing through a beautiful mountain
district, the traveler with depth of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and wealth of feeling has different
experiences from one who is poor in feeling. Only what we experience

<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> sails across the ocean, and only a few inward experiences <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span>
through his soul; another will hear the <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> language of the cosmic
spirit; for him are unveiled the mysterious riddles of existence. We must
learn to remain in touch with our own feelings and ideas if we wish to
develop any intimate relationship with the outer world. The outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

experienced the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> ourselves before we can hope to discover it
in our environment.
The student is told to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> apart moments in his daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in which to
withdraw into himself, quietly and alone. He is not to occupy himself at
such moments with the affairs of his own ego. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result in the
contrary of what is intended. He should rather let his experiences and the
messages from the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> re-echo <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> his own completely silent
self. At such silent moments every flower, every animal, every action will
unveil to him secrets undreamt of. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he will prepare himself to

eyes. The <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to enjoy impression after impression merely blunts the
faculty of cognition; the latter, however, is nurtured and cultivated if the
enjoyment once experienced is allowed to revel its message. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the
student must accustom himself not merely to let the enjoyment
reverberate, as it were, but rather to renounce any further enjoyment, and

The peril here is very great. Instead of
working inwardly, it is very easy to fall into the opposite habit of trying to
exploit the enjoyment. Let no one underestimate the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that immense
sources of error here confront the student. He must <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through a host of
tempters of his soul. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> all harden his ego and imprison it <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>

should seek enjoyment, for only through enjoyment can the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

cannot any longer draw nourishment from its environment. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> if he stops

the world. Enjoyment is to him like a scout informing him about the
world; but once instructed by enjoyment, he passes on to work. He does
not learn in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to accumulate learning as his own treasure, but in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span>

At the very beginning of his course, the student is directed to the path of

through and through with this principle will convince all who follow the
practical rules proffered to them that they need <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> none of their

One of the first of these rules can be expressed somewhat in the following
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of our language: Provide for yourself moments of inner tranquility,
and in these moments learn to distinguish between the essential and the

16

non-essential. It is said advisedly: “expressed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of our
language.” Originally all rules and teachings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science were
expressed in a symbolical sign-language, some understanding of which
must be acquired before its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> and scope can be realized. This
understanding is dependent on the first steps toward <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge,
and these steps result from the exact observation of such rules as are here
given. For all who earnestly will, the path stands open to tread.
Simple, in truth, is the above rule concerning moments of inner
tranquility; equally simple is its observation. But it only achieves its
purpose when it is observed in as earnest and strict a manner as it is, in
itself, simple. How this rule is to be observed will, therefore, be explained
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> digression.

himself with something quite different from the objects of his daily
occupation. The way, also, in which he occupies himself at such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
must differ entirely from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which he performs the rest of his daily
duties. But this does not mean that what he does in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> apart

that just these secluded moments, when sought in the right way, give him

observance of this rule will really encroach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> needed for the
performance of his duties. Should anyone really have no more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> at his
disposal, five minutes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> will suffice. It all depends on the manner in
which these five minutes are spent.
During these periods the student should wrest himself entirely <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from
his work-a-day life. His thoughts and feelings should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> on a different
coloring. His joys and sorrows, his cares, experiences and actions must
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> in review before his soul; and he must adopt such a position that he
may regard all his sundry experiences from a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> point of view.
We need only bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> how, in ordinary life, we regard the
experiences and actions of others quite differently from our own. This
cannot be otherwise, for we are interwoven with our own actions and
experiences, whereas those of others we only contemplate. Our aim in
these moments of seclusion must be so to contemplate and judge our own
actions and experiences as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they applied not to ourselves but to
some other person. Suppose, for example, a heavy misfortune befalls us.
How different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be our attitude toward a similar misfortune had it
befallen our neighbor. This attitude cannot be blamed as unjustifiable; it is
part of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, and applies equally to exceptional circumstances
and to the daily affairs of life. The student must seek the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of
confronting himself, at certain times, as a stranger. He must stand before
himself with the inner tranquility of a judge. When this is attained, our

17

own experiences present themselves in a new light. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as we are
interwoven with them and stand, as it were, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> them, we cling to the
non-essential just as much as to the essential. If we attain the calm inner
survey, the essential is severed from the non-essential. Sorrow and joy,
every thought, every resolve, appear different when we confront ourselves
in this way. It is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we had spent the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where
we beheld the smallest objects at the same close range as the largest, and
in the evening climbed a neighboring hill and surveyed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> scene at
a glance. Then the various parts appear related to each other in different
proportions from those they bore when seen from within. This exercise
will not and need not succeed with present occurrences of destiny, but it
should be attempted by the student in connection with the events of
destiny already experienced in the past. The value of such inner tranquil
self-contemplation depends far less on what is actually contemplated than
on our finding <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> ourselves the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> which such inner tranquility

different thought. Henceforth he says to himself: “I will summon all my

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> which makes him faint-hearted; for he knows that this very

any <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> it cannot contribute to the improvement of his work. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

into the student's outlook.

hampering, weakening effect. He begins to steer his own ship on a secure
course through the waves of life, whereas it was formerly battered to and
fro by these waves.
This calm and serenity react on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> being. They assist the growth of
the inner man, and, with the inner man, those faculties also grow which
lead to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. For it is by his progress in this direction that the
student gradually reaches the point where he himself determines the
manner in which the impressions of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> shall affect him. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>

feeling of the uselessness of impatience that henceforth, on every occasion
of impatience, this feeling is immediately present <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> us. The

will be filled by useful observations, which can be made while waiting.
Now, the scope and significance of these facts must be realized. We must
bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> us is in constant development. But
only the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of calm and serenity here described renders an orderly
development possible. The waves of outward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> constrain the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
from all sides if, instead of mastering this outward life, it masters him.
Such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is like a plant which tries to expand in a cleft in the rock and is
stunted in growth until new space is given it. No outward forces can
supply space to the inner man. It can only be supplied by the inner calm
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself gives to his soul. Outward circumstances can only alter
the course of his outward life; they can never awaken the inner <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
man. The student must himself give birth to a new and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>

therefore cannot unfold his powers. If it depends on something other than
myself <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> I should get angry or not, I am not <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> of myself, or, to

I must develop
the faculty of letting the impressions of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> approach me only

<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> a student. And only in as far as the student earnestly seeks this

in a given time; the point is that he should earnestly seek. Many have
striven for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> noticing any appreciable progress; but many of
those who did not despair, but remained unshaken, have then quite
suddenly achieved the inner victory.
No doubt a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> effort is required in many stations of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> to provide these
moments of inner calm; but the greater the effort needed, the more
important is the achievement. In <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science everything depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
energy, inward truthfulness, and uncompromising sincerity with which we
confront our own selves, with all our deeds and actions, as a complete
stranger.
But only one side of the student's inner activity is characterized by this
birth of his own <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> being. Something else is needed in addition. Even
if he confronts himself as a stranger it is only himself that he
contemplates; he looks on those experiences and actions with which he is
connected through his particular station of life. He must now disengage
himself from it and rise beyond to a purely <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> level, which no longer
has anything to do with his own special situation. He must <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to the
contemplation of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> concern him as a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being,
even if he lived under quite different circumstances and in quite a different
situation. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> something begins to live <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him which ranges
above the purely personal. His gaze is directed to worlds <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than those
with which every-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> connects him. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he begins to feel and
realize, as an inner experience, that he belongs to those <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds.
These are worlds concerning which his senses and his daily occupation
can tell him nothing. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he now shifts the central point of his being to
the inner part of his nature. He listens to the voices <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him which
<span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to him in his moments of tranquility; he cultivates an intercourse
with the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. He is removed from the every-day world. Its
noise is silenced. All around him there is silence. He puts away everything
that reminds him of such impressions from without. Calm inward
contemplation and converse with the purely <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> fill his soul. —
Such tranquil contemplation must become a natural necessity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
the student. He is now plunged in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of thought. He must develop a
living feeling for this silent thought-activity. He must learn to <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> what
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> pours into him. He will soon cease to feel that this thought-world
is less real than the every-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which surround him. He begins to
deal with his thoughts as with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in space, and the moment approaches

when he begins to feel that which reveals itself in the silent inward
thought-work to be much higher, much more real, than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in space.
He discovers that something living expresses itself in this thought-world.
He sees that his thoughts do not merely harbor shadow-pictures, but that
through them hidden <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to him. Out of the silence, speech
becomes audible to him. Formerly sound only reached him through his
ear; now it resounds through his soul. An inner language, an inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> is
revealed to him. This moment, when first experienced, is one of greatest
rapture for the student. An inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> is shed over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> external

(contemplative reflection). This meditation is the means to supersensible
knowledge. But the student in such moments must not merely indulge in
feelings; he must not have indefinite sensations in his soul. That <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

must be clear, sharp and definite, and he will be helped in this if he does
not cling blindly to the thoughts that rise <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him. Rather must he
permeate himself with the lofty thoughts by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> already advanced

with the writings which themselves had their origin in just such revelation
during meditation. In the mystic, gnostic and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientific literature
of today the student will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> such writings, and in them the material for
his meditation. The seekers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> have themselves <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> down in such
writings the thoughts of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> science which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> has directed
his messengers to proclaim to the world.
Through such meditation a complete transformation takes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the
student. He begins to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> quite new conceptions of reality. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
acquire a fresh value for him. It cannot be repeated too often that this
transformation does not alienate him from the world. He will in no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be
estranged from his daily tasks and duties, for he comes to realize that the
most insignificant action he has to accomplish, the most insignificant
experience which offers itself to him, stands in connection with cosmic
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and cosmic events. When once this connection is revealed to him in
his moments of contemplation, he comes to his daily activities with a new,
fuller power. For now he knows that his labor and his suffering are given
and endured for the sake of a great, spiritual, cosmic whole. Not
weariness, but strength to live springs from meditation.
With firm step the student passes through life. No matter what it may
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> him, he goes forward erect. In the past he knew not why he labored
and suffered, but now he knows. It is obvious that such meditation leads
more surely to the goal if conducted under the direction of experienced

persons who know of themselves how everything may best be done; and
their advice and guidance should be sought. Truly, no one loses his
freedom thereby. What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise be mere uncertain groping in the

vain, only they must realize that what they seek is the advice of a friend,
not the domination of a would-be ruler. It will always be found that they
who really know are the most modest of men, and that nothing is further
from their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> than what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the lust for power.
When, by means of meditation, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> rises to union with the spirit, he

The existence of this <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">eternal</span> being can only be doubted by those who have
not themselves experienced it. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> meditation is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which also
leads <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to the knowledge, to the contemplation of his eternal,
indestructible, essential being; and it is only through meditation that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
can attain to such knowledge. Gnosis and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Science tell of the

asked: Why does a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> know nothing of his experiences beyond the
borders of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death? Not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> should we ask, but rather: How can we
attain such knowledge? In right meditation the path is opened. This alone
can revive the memory of experiences beyond the border of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and death.
Everyone can attain this knowledge; in each one of us lies the faculty of
recognizing and contemplating for ourselves what genuine Mysticism,

must be chosen. Only a being with ears and <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> can apprehend sounds
and colors; nor can the eye perceive if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> which makes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> visible

II
The Stages of Initiation
The information given in the following chapters constitutes steps in an
esoteric training, the name and character of which will be understood by
all who apply this information in the right way. It refers to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages
through which the training of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> leads to a certain degree of
initiation. But only so much will here be explained as can be publicly
imparted. These are merely indications extracted from a still deeper and
more intimate doctrine. In esoteric training itself a quite definite course of
instruction is followed. Certain exercises enable the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to attain to a
conscious intercourse with the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. These exercises bear about
the same relation to what will be imparted in the following pages, as the
instruction given in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> strictly disciplined school bears to the
incidental training. But impatient dabbling, devoid of earnest
perseverance, can lead to nothing at all. The study of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Science can
only be successful if the student retain what has already been indicated in
the preceding chapter, and on the basis of this proceed further.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages which the above-mentioned tradition specifies, are as
follows: (1) preparation; (2) enlightenment; (3) initiation. It is not
altogether necessary that the first of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages should be
completed before the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> can be begun, nor that the second, in turn, be
completed before the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> be started. In certain respects it is possible to
partake of enlightenment, and even of initiation, and in other respects still
be in the preparatory stage. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it will be necessary to spend a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
in the stage of preparation before any enlightenment can begin; and, at
least in some respects, enlightenment must be completed before it is even
possible to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the stage of initiation. But in describing them it is
necessary, for the sake of clarity, that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> stages be made to follow in
order.
Preparation
Preparation consists in a strict and definite cultivation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling, through which the psycho-spiritual <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes
equipped with <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> senses and organs of activity in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that
natural forces have fitted the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> with organs built out of
indeterminate living matter.
To begin with, the attention of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is directed to certain events in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that surrounds us. Such events are, on the one hand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> that is
budding, growing, and flourishing, and on the other hand, all phenomena
connected with fading, decaying, and withering. The student can observe
these events simultaneously, wherever he turns his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and on every

23

occasion they naturally evoke in him feelings and thoughts; but in
ordinary circumstances he does not devote himself sufficiently to them.
He hurries on too quickly from impression to impression. It is necessary,
therefore, that he should fix his attention intently and consciously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
these phenomena. Wherever he observes a definite <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of blooming and
flourishing, he must banish everything else from his soul, and entirely
surrender himself, for a short time, to this one impression. He will soon
convince himself that a feeling which heretofore in a similar case, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
merely have flitted through his soul, now swells out and assumes a
powerful and energetic form. He must now allow this feeling to
reverberate quietly <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself while keeping inwardly quite still. He
must cut himself off from the outer world, and simply and solely follow
what his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> tells him of this blossoming and flourishing.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it must not be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that much progress can be made if the senses
are blunted to the world. First look at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as keenly and as intently
as you possibly can; then only let the feeling which expands to life, and
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> which arises in the soul, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> possession of you. The point is
that the attention should be directed with perfect inner balance <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> both
phenomena. If the necessary tranquility be attained and you surrender
yourself to the feeling which expands to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the soul, then, in due time,
the following experience will ensue. Thoughts and feelings of a new <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
and unknown before will be noticed uprising in the soul. Indeed, the more
often the attention be fixed alternately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> something growing,
blossoming and flourishing, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> something else that is fading and
decaying, the more vivid will these feelings become. And just as the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span>
and ears of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> are built by natural forces out of living
matter, so will the organs of clairvoyance build themselves out of the
feelings and thoughts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> evoked. A quite definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of feeling is
connected with growth and expansion, and another equally definite with
all that is fading and decaying. But this is only the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> if the effort be
made to cultivate these feelings in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> indicated. It is possible to
describe approximately what these feelings are like. A <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> conception of
them is <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the reach of all who undergo these inner experiences.
If the attention be frequently fixed on the phenomena of growing,
blooming and flourishing, a feeling remotely allied to the sensation of a
sunrise will ensue, while the phenomena of fading and decaying will
produce an experience comparable, in the same way, to the slow rising of
the moon on the horizon. Both these feelings are forces which, when duly
cultivated and developed to ever increasing intensity, lead to the most
significant <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> results. A new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is opened to the student if he
systematically and deliberately surrenders himself to such feelings. The
soul-world, the so-called astral plane, begins to dawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him. Growth
and decay are no longer facts which make indefinite impressions on him
as of old, but rather they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> themselves into <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> lines and figures of

24

which he had previously suspected nothing. And these lines and figures
have, for the different phenomena, different forms. A blooming flower, an
animal in the process of growth, a tree that is decaying, evoke in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
different lines. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> (astral plane) broadens out slowly before
him. These lines and figures are in no <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> arbitrary. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> students who
have reached the corresponding stage of development will always see the
same lines and figures under the same conditions. Just as a round table
will be seen as round by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> normal persons, and not as round by one and
square by the other, so too, at the sight of a flower, the same <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
figure is presented to the soul. And just as the forms of animals and plants
are described in ordinary natural history, so too, the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist
describes or draws the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms of the process of growth and decay,
according to species and kind.
If the student has progressed so far that he can perceive the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms
of those phenomena which are physically visible to his external sight, he is
then not far from the stage where he will <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t11 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t26 hoverable">behold</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which have no
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> existence, and which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> remain entirely hidden (occult)
from those who have not received suitable instruction and training.
It should be emphasized that the student must never lose himself in
speculations on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> or another. Such intellectualizing
will only draw him away from the right road. He should look out on the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with keen, healthy senses and quickened <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of observation, and
then give himself up to the feeling that arises <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him. He should not
try to make out, through intellectual speculation, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of things,
but rather allow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to disclose themselves. It should be remarked
that artistic feeling, when coupled with a quiet introspective nature, forms
the best preliminary condition for the development of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> faculties.
This feeling pierces through the superficial aspect of things, and in so
doing touches their secrets.
A further point of importance is what <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science calls orientation in
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. This is attained when the student is permeated, through
and through, with the conscious realization that feelings and thoughts are
just as much veritable realities as are tables and chairs in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> world, feelings and thoughts react
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> each other just as do <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> objects in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
as the student is not vividly permeated with this consciousness, he will not
believe that a wrong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> may have as devastating an effect
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> other thoughts that spread <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as the effect
wrought by a bullet fired at random <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> objects it hits. He
will perhaps never allow himself to perform a physically visible action
which he considers to be wrong, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he will not shrink from harboring
wrong thoughts and feelings, for these appear harmless to the rest of the
world. There can be no progress, however, on the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>

25

knowledge unless we guard our thoughts and feelings in just the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
we guard out steps in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. If we see a wall before us, we do
not attempt to dash right through it, but turn aside. In other words, we
guide ourselves by the laws of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. There are such laws,
too, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> world, only they cannot impose themselves
on us from without. They must flow out of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> itself. This
can be attained if we forbid ourselves to harbor wrong thoughts and
feelings. All arbitrary flitting to and fro in thought, all accidental ebbing
and flowing of emotion must be forbidden in the same way. In so doing
we do not become deficient in feeling. On the contrary, if we regulate our
inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in this way, we shall soon <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> ourselves becoming rich in
feelings and creative with genuine imagination. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of petty
emotionalism and capricious flights of thought, there appear significant
emotions and thoughts that are fruitful. Feelings and thoughts of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
lead the student to orientation in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. He gains a right
position in relation to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world; a distinct and
definite result comes into effect in his favor. Just as he, as a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> man,
finds his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> among <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> things, so, too, his path now leads him
between growth and decay, which he has already come to know in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
described above. On the one hand, he follows all processes of growing and
flourishing and, on the other, of withering and decaying in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that is
necessary for his own and the world's advancement.
The student has also to bestow a further care on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of sound. He
must discriminate between sounds that are produced by the so-called inert
(lifeless) bodies, for instance, a bell, or a musical instrument, or a falling
mass, and those which proceed from a living creature (an animal or a
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being.) When a bell is struck, we hear the sound and connect a
pleasant feeling with it; but when we hear the cry of an animal, we can,
besides our own feeling, detect through it the manifestation of an inward
experience of the animal, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> of pleasure or pain. It is with the latter
<span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of sound that the student sets to work. He must concentrate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
attention on the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the sound tells him of something that lies outside
his own soul. He must immerse himself in this foreign thing. He must
closely unite his own feeling with the pleasure or pain of which the sound
tells him. He must get beyond the point of caring whether, for him, the
sound is pleasant or unpleasant, agreeable or disagreeable, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
must be filled with whatever is occurring in the being from which the
sound proceeds. Through such exercises, if systematically and deliberately
performed, the student will develop <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself the faculty of
intermingling, as it were, with the being from which the sound proceeds.
A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> sensitive to music will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> it easier than one who is unmusical
to cultivate his inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in this way; but no one should suppose that a
mere <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> for music can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of this inner activity. The student
must learn to feel in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of nature. This
implants a new faculty in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling.

student. What was hitherto merely incomprehensible noise to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
becomes by this means a coherent language of nature. And whereas
hitherto he only <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> sound from the so-called inanimate objects, he now
is aware of a new language of the soul. Should he advance further in this
inner culture, he will soon learn that he can hear what hitherto he did not
even surmise. He begins to hear with the soul.
To this, one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> more must be added before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> point in this
region can be attained. Of very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> importance for the development of
the student is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which he listens to others when they speak. He
must accustom himself to do this in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that, while listening, his
inner self is absolutely silent. If someone expresses an opinion and another
listens, assent or dissent will, generally speaking, stir in the inner self of
the listener. Many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in such cases feel themselves impelled to an
expression of their assent, or more especially, of their dissent. In the
student, all such assent or dissent must be silenced. It is not imperative
that he should suddenly alter his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of living by trying to attain at all
times to this complete inner silence. He will have to begin by doing so in
special cases, deliberately selected by himself. Then quite slowly and by
degrees, this new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of listening will creep into his habits, as of itself. In
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> research this is systematically practiced. The student feels it his
duty to listen, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of practice, at certain times to the most
contradictory views and, at the same time, <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> entirely to silence all
assent, and more especially, all adverse criticism. The point is that in so
doing, not only all purely intellectual judgment be silenced, but also all
feelings of displeasure, denial, or even assent. The student must at all
times be particularly watchful lest such feelings, even when not on the
surface, should still lurk in the innermost recess of the soul. He must
listen, for example, to the statements of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are, in some respects,
far beneath him, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> while doing so suppress every feeling of greater
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> or superiority. It is useful for everyone to listen in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to
children, for even the wisest can learn incalculably much from children.
The student can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> train himself to listen to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of others quite
selflessly, completely shutting down his own <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> and his opinions and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of feeling. When he practices listening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> criticism, even when a
completely contradictory opinion is advanced, when the most hopeless
mistake is committed before him, he then learns, little by little, to blend
himself with the being of another and become identified with it. Then he
hears through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the other. Through continued
exercise of this kind, sound becomes the right medium for the perception
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit. Of course it implies the very strictest self-discipline, but
the latter leads to a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> goal. When these exercises are practiced in
connection with the other already given, dealing with the sounds of nature,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> develops a new <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of hearing. She is now able to perceive
manifestations from the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which do not <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> their expression

27

in sounds perceptible to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> ear. The perception of the “inner
word” awakens. Gradually truths reveal themselves to the student from the
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. He hears speech uttered to him in a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> way. Only to
those who, by selfless listening, train themselves to be really receptive
from within, in stillness, unmoved by personal opinion or feeling only to
such can the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of whom <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science tells. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
as one hurls any personal opinion or feeling against the speaker to whom
one must listen, the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> remain silent.
All <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truths are attained through such inwardly instilled speech, and
what we hear from the lips of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> teacher has been experienced
by him in this manner. But this does not mean that it is unimportant for us
to acquaint ourselves with the writings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science before we can
ourselves hear such inwardly instilled speech. On the contrary, the reading
of such writings and the listening to the teachings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science are
themselves means of attaining personal knowledge. Every sentence of
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science we hear is of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> to direct the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to the point
which must be reached before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> can experience real progress. To
the practice of all that has here been indicated must be added the ardent
study of what the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> researchers impart to the world. In all esoteric
training such study belongs to the preparatory period, and all other
methods will prove ineffective if due receptivity for the teachings of the
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> researcher is lacking. For since these instructions are culled from
the living inner word, from the living inwardly instilled speech, they are
themselves gifted with <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> life. They are not mere words; they are
living powers. And while you follow the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of one who knows, while
you read a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> that springs from real inner experience, powers are at
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which make you clairvoyant, just as natural forces have
created out of living matter your <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and your ears.
Enlightenment
Enlightenment proceeds from very simple processes. Here, too, it is a
matter of developing certain feelings and thoughts which slumber in every
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being and must be awakened. It is only when these simple
processes are carried out with unfailing patience, continuously and
conscientiously, that they can lead to the perception of the inner lightforms. The first step is <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by observing different natural objects in a
particular way; for instance, a transparent and beautifully formed stone (a
crystal), a plant, and an animal. The student should endeavor, at first, to
direct his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> attention to a comparison of the stone with the animal in
the following manner. The thoughts here mentioned should <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> accompanied by vivid feelings, and no other thought, no other
feeling, must mingle with them and disturb what should be an intensely
attentive observation. The student says to himself: “The stone has a form;
the animal also has a form. The stone remains motionless in its place. The

28

animal changes its place. It is instinct (desire) which causes the animal to
change its place. Instincts, too, are served by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the animal. Its
organs and limbs are fashioned in accordance with these instincts. The
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the stone is not fashioned in accordance with desires, but in
accordance with desireless force.” (The <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> here mentioned, in its bearing
on the contemplation of crystals, is in many ways distorted by those who
have only <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> of it in an outward, exoteric manner, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> such
practices as crystal-gazing have their origin Such manipulations are based
on a misunderstanding. They have been described in many books, but they
never <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the subject of genuine esoteric teaching.)
By sinking deeply into such thoughts, and while doing so, observing the
stone and the animal with rapt attention, there arise in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> quite
separate kinds of feelings. From the stone there flows into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> the one
<span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of feeling, and from the animal the other kind. The attempt will
probably not succeed at first, but little by little, with genuine and patient
practice, these feelings ensue. Only, this exercise must be practiced over
and over again. At first the feelings are only present as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the
observation lasts. Later on they continue, and then they grow to something
which remains living in the soul. The student has then but to reflect, and
both feelings will always arise, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the contemplation of an
external object. Out of these feelings and the thoughts that are bound up
with them, the organs of clairvoyance are formed. If the plant should then
be included in this observation, it will be noticed that the feeling flowing
from it lies between the feelings derived from the stone and the animal, in
both quality and degree. The organs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> formed are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> eyes. The
students gradually learns, by their means, to see something like <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and

The <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with its lines and figures remains dark as

noted that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> “dark” and “light,” as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the other expressions
used, only approximately describe what is meant. This cannot be
otherwise if ordinary language is used, for this language was created to
suit <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> conditions. <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> science describes that which, for
clairvoyant organs, flows from the stone, as blue, or blue-red; and that
which is felt as coming from the animal as red or red-yellow. In reality,
colors of a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> are seen. The color proceeding the plant is green
which little by little turns into a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> ethereal pink. The plant is actually
that product of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> which in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds resembles, in certain
respects, its constitution in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. The same does not apply to
the stone and the animal. It must now be clearly understood that the
above-mentioned colors only represent the principal shades in the stone,
plant and animal kingdom. In reality, all possible intermediate shades are
present. Every stone, every plant, every animal has its own particular
shade of color. In addition to these there are also the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds who never incarnate physically, but who have their colors, often

wonderful, often horrible. Indeed, the wealth of color in these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds is immeasurably greater than in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world.
Once the faculty of seeing with <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> has been acquired, one then
encounters sooner or later the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> here mentioned, some of them
higher, some lower than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself--beings that never enter <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
reality.
If this point has been reached, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> deal lies open. But it is
inadvisable to proceed further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> paying careful heed to what is said
or otherwise imparted by the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> researcher. And for that, too, which
has been described, attention paid to such experienced guidance is the very
best thing. Moreover, if a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has the strength and the endurance to travel
so far that he fulfills the elementary conditions of enlightenment, he will
assuredly seek and <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the right guidance.
But in any circumstances, one precaution is necessary, failing which it
were better to leave untrodden all steps on the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. It
is necessary that the student should lose none of his qualities as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and
noble man, or his receptivity for all <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> reality. Indeed, throughout
his training he must continually increase his moral strength, his inner
purity, and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of observation. To give an example: during the
elementary exercises on enlightenment, the student must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> care always
to enlarge his sympathy for the animal and the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> worlds, and his
<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> for the beauty of nature. Failing this care, such exercises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
continually blunt that feeling and that sense; the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become
hardened, and the senses blunted, and that could only lead to perilous
results.
How enlightenment proceeds if the student rises, in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the
foregoing exercises, from the stone, the plant, and the animal, up to man,

so.

It is sought in
many ways, and many dangerous and even despicable practices are
attempted. It is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that they who claim to know something of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> in these matters <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> before others the possibility of learning
something of esoteric training. Only so much is here imparted as accords
with this possibility. It is necessary that something of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> should

doing an exercise for a few minutes, the student must be able to stop and

mingle with the day's work. NO one is of <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> as an esoteric student or will

When the student seeks the path leading to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
described in the preceding chapter, he should not omit to fortify himself;
throughout his work, with one ever present thought. He must never cease
repeating to himself that he may have made quite considerable progress
after a certain interval of time, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it may not be apparent to him in the

all attempts after a short time. The powers and faculties to be developed
are of a most subtle kind, and differ entirely in their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> from the
conceptions previously formed by the student. He had been accustomed to
occupy himself exclusively with the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>

not surprising if he does not immediately notice the powers of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and

discouragement for those setting out on the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, if
they ignore the experience gathered by responsible investigators. The
teacher is aware of the progress made by his pupil <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before the latter is

assist in the awakening of slumbering faculties. But what he imparts out of

soon after having <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> foot <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it, because their progress is not
immediately apparent to them. And even when the first experiences begin
to dawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the pupil, he is apt to regard them as illusions, because he
had formed quite different conceptions of what he was going to
experience. He loses courage, either because he regards these first
experiences as being of no value, or because they appear to him to be so
insignificant that he cannot believe they will lead him to any appreciable
results <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> a measurable time.

beacons which must never be extinguished on the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge. No one will ever travel far who cannot <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> himself to repeat,

over and over again, an exercise which has failed, apparently, for a
countless <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of times.
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">Long</span> before any distinct perception of progress, there rises in the student,
from the hidden depths of the soul, a feeling that he is on the right path.
This feeling should be cherished and fostered, for it can develop into a
trustworthy guide. Above all, it is imperative to extirpate the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that any
fantastic, mysterious practices are required for the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge. It must be clearly realized that a start has to be made with the
thoughts and feelings with which we continually live, and that these
feelings and thoughts must merely be given a new direction. Everyone
must say to himself: “In my own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling the deepest
mysteries lie hidden, only hitherto I have been unable to perceive them.”
In the end it all resolves itself into the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> ordinarily carries

only of his body, and not of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit. The student becomes
conscious of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit, just as the ordinary <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is conscious of his
body. Hence it is highly important to give the proper direction to thoughts
and feelings, for then only can the perception be developed of all that is
invisible in ordinary life. One of the ways by which this development may
be carried out will now be indicated. Again, like almost everything else so
far explained, it is quite a simple matter. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> its results are of the greatest
consequence, if the necessary devotion and sympathy be applied.
Let the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> before himself the small seed of a plant, and while
contemplating this insignificant object, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> with intensity the right <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of thoughts, and through these thoughts develop certain feelings. In the
first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> let him clearly grasp what he really sees with his eyes. Let him
describe to himself the shape, color and all other qualities of the seed.
Then let his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the following train of thought: “Out of the
seed, if planted in the soil, a plant of complex structure will grow.” Let
him build up this plant in his imagination, and reflect as follows: “What I
am now picturing to myself in my imagination will later on be enticed
from the seed by the forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and light. If I had before me an
artificial <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> which imitated the seed to such a deceptive degree that my
<span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> could not distinguish it from a real seed, no forces of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span>
could avail to produce from it a plant.” If the student thoroughly grasps
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> so that it becomes an inward experience, he will also be able
to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and couple it with the right feeling: “All that
will ultimately grow out of the seed is now secretly enfolded <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> it as
the force of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> plant. In the artificial imitation of the seed there is
no such force present. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> both appear alike to my eyes. The real seed,
therefore, contains something invisible which is not present in the
imitation.” It is on this invisible something that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling are to
be concentrated. (Anyone objecting that a microscopical examination

only show that he had failed to grasp the point. The intention is not to
investigate the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the object, but to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> it for the
development of psycho-spiritual forces.)
Let the student fully realize that this invisible something will transmute
itself later on into a visible plant, which he will have before him in its
shape and color. Let him ponder on the thought: “The invisible will
become visible. If I could not think, then that which will only become
visible later on could not already make its presence felt to me.” Particular
stress must be laid on the following point: what the student thinks he must
also feel with intensity. In inner tranquility, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> mentioned above
must become a conscious inner experience, to the exclusion of all other
thoughts and disturbances. And sufficient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> must be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> to allow the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and the feeling which is coupled with it to bore themselves into
the soul, as it were. If this be accomplished in the right way, then after a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> — possibly not until after numerous attempts — an inner force will
make itself felt. This force will create new powers of perception. The grain
of seed will appear as if enveloped in a small luminous cloud. In a
sensible-supersensible way, it will be felt as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of flame. The center of
this flame evokes the same feeling that one has when under the impression
of the color lilac, and the edges as when under the impression of a bluish
tone. What was formerly invisible now becomes visible, for it is created
by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the thoughts and feelings we have stirred to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
ourselves. The plant itself will not become visible until later, so that the
physically invisible now reveals itself in a spiritually visible way.
It is not surprising that all this appears to many as illusion. “What is the
<span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of such visions,” they ask, “and such hallucinations?” And many will
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> fall away and abandon the path. But this is precisely the important
point: not to confuse <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> reality with imagination at this difficult
stage of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution, and further-more, to have the courage to press
onward and not become timorous and faint-hearted. On the other hand,
however, the necessity must be emphasized of maintaining unimpaired
and of perpetually cultivating that healthy sound <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> which distinguishes
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> from illusion. Fully conscious self-control must never be lost during
all these exercises, and they must be accompanied by the same sane, sound
thinking which is applied to the details of every-day life. To lapse into
reveries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be fatal. The intellectual clarity, not to say the sobriety of
thought, must never for a moment be dulled. The greatest mistake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be made if the student's mental balance were disturbed through such
exercises, if he were hampered in judging the matters of his daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as
sanely and as soundly as before. He should examine himself again and
again to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> out if he has remained unaltered in relation to the
circumstances among which he lives, or <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> he may perhaps have
become unbalanced. Above all, strict care must be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> not to drift at
random into vague reveries, or to experiment with all kinds of exercises.

The trains of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> here indicated have been tested and practiced in
esoteric training since the earliest times, and only such are given in these
pages. Anyone attempting to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> others devised by himself, or of which he
may have <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> or read at one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> or another, will inevitably go astray
and <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> himself on the path of boundless chimera.
As a further exercise to succeed the one just described, the following may
be taken: Let the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> before him a plant which has attained the
stage of <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> development. Now let him fill his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> that
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> will come when this plant will wither and die. “Nothing will be
<span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> of what I now see before me. But this plant will have developed seeds
which, in their turn, will develop to new plants. I again become aware that
in what I see, something lies hidden which I cannot see. I fill my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
entirely with the thought: this plant with its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and colors, will in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
be no more. But the reflection that it produces seeds teaches me that it will
not disappear into nothing. I cannot at present see with my <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> that which
guards it from disappearance, any more than I previously could discern
the plant in the grain of seed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> there is something in the plant which
my <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> cannot see. If I let this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> live <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> me, and if the
corresponding feeling be coupled with it, then, in due time, there will
again develop in my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> a force which will ripen into a new perception.”
Out of the plant there again grows a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> flame-form, which is,
of course, correspondingly larger than the one previously described. The
flame can be felt as being greenish-blue in the center, and yellowish-red at
the outer edge.
It must be explicitly emphasized that the colors here described are not seen
as the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> see colors, but that through <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> perception the
same feeling is experienced as in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> color-impression.
To apprehend blue spiritually means to have a sensation similar to the one
experienced when the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> eye rests on the color blue. This <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> must
be noted by all who intend to rise to <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> perception. Otherwise they
will expect a mere repetition of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> in the spiritual. This could
only lead to the bitterest deception.
Anyone having reached this point of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision is the richer by a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
deal, for he can perceive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> not only in their present <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of being but
also in their process of growth and decay. He begins to see in all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> the
spirit, of which <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> can know nothing. And therewith he has
<span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> the first step toward the gradual solution, through personal vision, of
the secret of birth and death. For the outer senses a being comes into
existence through birth, and passes away through death. This, however, is
only because these senses cannot perceive the concealed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the
being. For the spirit, birth and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> are merely a transformation, just as
the unfolding of the flower from the bud is a transformation enacted
before our <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> eyes. But if we <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to learn this through personal

vision we must first awaken the requisite <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> here

and the methods described above are safer and apply equally to all. It is
possible to acquire some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of chemistry in an exceptional way,
but if you wish to become a chemist you must follow the recognized and
reliable course.
An error fraught with serious consequences <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> ensue if it were
assumed that the desired result could be reached more easily if the grain of
seed or the plant mentioned above were merely imagined, were merely
pictured in the imagination. This might lead to results, but not so surely as
the method here. The vision <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attained would, in most cases, be a mere

Once the student has found the beginnings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> vision by means of
such exercises, he may proceed to the contemplation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself.
Simple phenomena of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must first be chosen. But before making
any attempt in this direction it is imperative for the student to strive for the
absolute purity of his moral character. He must banish all through of ever
using <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gained in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> for his own personal benefit. He must
be convinced that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> never, under any circumstances, avail himself
in an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> he may gain over his fellow-creatures. For
this reason, all who seek to discover through personal vision the secrets in
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> must follow the golden rule of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science. This
golden rule is as follows: For every one step that you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> in the pursuit of

character. If this rule is observed, such exercise as the following may be
attempted:
Recall to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> some <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> whom you may have observed when he was
filled with <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for some object. Direct your attention to this desire. It is
best to recall to memory that moment when the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> was at its height,
and it was still uncertain <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be

35

attained. And now fill your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> with this recollection, and reflect on what
you can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> observe. Maintain the utmost inner tranquility. Make the
greatest possible effort to be blind and deaf to everything that may be
going on around you, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> special heed that through the conception
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> evoked a feeling should awaken in your soul. Allow this feeling to rise
in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> like a cloud on the cloudless horizon. As a rule, of course,
your reflection will be interrupted, because the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> whom it concerns
was not observed in this particular <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for a sufficient length of
time. The attempt will most likely fail hundreds and hundreds of times. It
is just a question of not losing patience. After many attempts you will
succeed in experiencing a feeling In your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> corresponding to the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> observed, and you will begin to notice that through
this feeling a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> grows in your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> that leads to <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> insight into
the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the other. A picture experienced as luminous appears in
your field of vision. This spiritually luminous picture is the so-called astral
embodiment of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> observed in that soul. Again the impression of
this picture may be described as flame-like, yellowish-red in the center,
and reddish-blue or lilac at the edges. Much depends on treating such
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> experiences with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> delicacy. The best <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> is not to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to
anyone about them except to your teacher, if you have one. Attempted
descriptions of such experiences in inappropriate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> usually only lead
to gross self-deception. Ordinary terms are employed which are not
intended for such things, and are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> too gross and clumsy. The
consequence is that in the attempt to clothe the experience in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> we are
misled into blending the actual experience with all kinds of fantastic
delusions. Here again is another important rule for the student: know how
to observe silence concerning your <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> experiences. Yes, observe
silence even toward yourself. Do not attempt to clothe in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> what you
contemplate in the spirit, or to pore over it with clumsy intellect. Lend
yourself freely and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reservation to these <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> impressions, and
do not disturb them by reflecting and pondering over them too much. For
you must remember that your reasoning faculties are, to begin with, by no
means equal to your new experience. You have acquired these reasoning
faculties in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> hitherto confined to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the senses; the
faculties you are not acquiring transcend this world. Do not try, therefore,
to apply to the new and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> perceptions the standard of the old. Only he
who has gained some certainty and steadiness in the observation of inner

some wish, the gratification of some desire, has been granted. If the same

By such observation of his fellow-creatures, the student may easily lapse
into a moral fault. He may become cold-hearted. Every conceivable effort
must be made to prevent this. Such observation should only be practiced
by one who has already risen to the level on which complete certainty is
found that thoughts are real things. He will then no longer allow himself to
think of his fellow-men in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that is incompatible with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>

being could be merely an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of observation must never for a moment
be entertained. Self-education must see to it that this insight into <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

A feeling of
reverential awe must fill us, even in our recollections.
For the present, only these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> examples can be given to show how
enlightened insight into <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> may be achieved; they will at least
serve to point out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to be taken. By gaining the inner tranquility and
repose indispensable for such observation, the student will have undergone
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> inner transformation. He will then soon reach the point where this
enrichment of his inner self will lend confidence and composure to his
outward demeanor. And this transformation of his outward demeanor will
again react favorably on his soul. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he will be able to help himself
further along the road. He will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> ways and means of penetrating more
and more into the secrets of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> which are hidden from our
external senses, and he will then also become ripe for a deeper insight into
the mysterious connections between <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and all else that exists
in the universe. By following this path the student approaches closer and
closer to the moment when he can effectively <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> the first steps of
initiation. But before these can be taken, one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> more is necessary,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> at first its need will be least of all apparent; later on, however, the
student will be convinced of it.
The would-be initiate must <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> with him a certain measure of courage
and fearlessness. He must positively go out of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
opportunities for developing these virtues. His training should provide for
their systematic cultivation. In this respect, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> itself is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> school —
possibly the best school. The student must learn to look danger calmly in
the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> and try to overcome difficulties unswervingly. For instance, when
in the presence of some peril, he must swiftly come to the conviction that
<span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> is of no possible use; I must not feel afraid; I must only think of what
is to be done. And he must improve to the extent of feeling, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
occasions which formerly inspired him with fear, that to be frightened, to
be disheartened, are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that are out of the question as far as his own
inmost self is concerned. By self-discipline in this direction, quite definite
qualities are develop which are necessary for initiation into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
mysteries. Just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> requires nervous force in his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> being in

force which is only developed in the courageous and the fearless. For in
penetrating to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> mysteries he will see <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are concealed
from ordinary humanity by the illusion of the senses. If the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses
do not allow us to perceive the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truth, they are for this very <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span>
our benefactors. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> are thereby hidden from us which, if realized

and the sight of which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be unendurable. The student must be fit to
endure this sight. He loses certain supports in the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which he
owes to the very illusion surrounding him. It is truly and literally as if the
attention of someone were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to a danger which had threatened him for
a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> time, but of which he knew nothing. Hitherto he felt no fear, but
now that he knows, he is overcome by fear, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the danger has not
been rendered greater by his knowing it.
The forces at <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> are both destructive and constructive; the
destiny of manifested <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> is birth and death. The seer is to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t9 t11 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t26 hoverable">behold</span> the
working of these forces and the march of destiny. The veil enshrouding
the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> in ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is to be removed. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is interwoven
with these forces and with this destiny. His own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> harbors destructive
and constructive forces. His own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> reveals itself to the seer as
undisguised as the other objects. He must not lose strength in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of
this self-knowledge; but strength will fail him unless he brings a surplus
on which to draw. For this purpose he must learn to maintain inner calm
and steadiness in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of difficult circumstances; he must cultivate a
strong trust in the beneficent powers of existence. He must be prepared to
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that many motives which had actuated him hitherto will do so no
longer. He will have to recognize that previously he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and acted in a
certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> only because he was still in the throes of ignorance. Reasons
that influenced him formerly will now disappear. He often acted out of
vanity; he will now see how utterly futile all vanity is for the seer. He
often acted out of greed; he will now become aware how destructive all
greed is. He will have to develop quite new motives for his thoughts and
actions, and it is just for this purpose that courage and fearlessness are
required.
It is pre-eminently a question of cultivating this courage and this
fearlessness in the inmost depths of thought-life. The student must learn
never to despair over failure. He must be equal to the thought: I shall
forget that I have failed in this matter, and I shall try once more as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
this had not happened. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he will struggle through to the firm
conviction that the fountain-head of strength from which he may draw is
inexhaustible. He struggles ever onward to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> which will uplift him
and support him, however weak and impotent his earthly self may have
proved. He must be capable of pressing on to the future undismayed by
any experiences of the past. If the student has acquired these faculties up

38

to a certain point, he is then ripe to hear the real names of things, which
are the key to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. For initiation consists in this very act of
learning to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by those names which they bear in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of their <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> authors. In these, their names, lies the mystery of
things. It is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that the initiates <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> a different language
from the uninitiated, for the former know the names by which the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
themselves are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> into existence.
In as far as initiation itself can be discussed, this will be done in the
following chapter.

Initiation
Initiation is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> stage in an esoteric training concerning which it is
possible to give some indications in a <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> intended for the genuine
public. Whatever lives beyond forms a subject difficult to understand, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

enlightenment, and initiation as far as the lesser mysteries.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and proficiency conferred by initiation cannot be obtained
in any other manner, except in some far distant future, after many
incarnations, by quite different means and in quite a different form. The
initiate of today undergoes experiences which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise come to
him much later, under quite different circumstances.
The secrets of existence are only accessible to an extent corresponding to
man's own degree of maturity. For this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> alone the path to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
stages of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is beset with obstacles. A firearm should
not be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> until sufficient experience has been gained to avoid disaster,
caused by its use. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> initiated today <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> further ado <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lack
the experience which he will gain during his future incarnations before he
can attain to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in the normal course of his development.
At the portal of initiation, therefore, this experience must be supplied in
some other way. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the first instructions given to the candidate for
initiation serve as a substitute for these future experiences. These are the
so-called trials, which he has to undergo, and which constitute a normal
course of inner development resulting from due application to such
exercises as are described in the preceding chapters.
These trials are often discussed in books, but it is only natural that such
discussions should as a rule give quite false impressions of their nature;
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> passing through preparation and enlightenment no one can
know anything of these tests and appropriately describe them.
The would-be initiate must come into contact with certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and facts
belonging to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, but he can only see and hear them if his
feeling is ripe for the perception of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forms, colors and tones
described in the chapters on Preparation and Enlightenment.
The first trial consists in obtaining a truer vision than the average <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has
of the corporeal attributes of lifeless things, and later of plants, animals
and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. This does not mean what at present is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> scientific
knowledge, for it is a question not of science but of vision. As a rule, the
would-be initiate proceeds to learn how the objects of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> gifted with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> manifest themselves to the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ear and the
40

spiritual eye. In a certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> then lie stripped — naked —
before the beholder. The qualities which can then be seen and <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> are
hidden from the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and ears. For <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> perception they are
concealed as if by a veil, and the falling away of this veil for the would-be
initiate consists in a process designated as the process of Purification by
Fire. The first trial is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> known as the Fire-Trial.
For many people, ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is itself a more or less unconscious process
of initiation through the Fire-Trial. Such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> have passed through a
wealth of experience, so that their self-confidence, courage and fortitude
have been greatly strengthened in a normal manner while learning to bear
sorrow, disappointment and failure in their undertakings with greatness of
soul, and especially with equanimity and unbroken strength. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they are
often initiates <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing it, and it then needs but little to unseal
their <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> hearing and sight so that they become clairvoyant. For it
must be noted that a genuine fire-trial is not intended to satisfy the
curiosity of the candidate. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that he learns many uncommon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
of which others can have no inkling, but this acquisition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is
not the end, but the means to the end; the end consists in the attainment,
thanks to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, of greater and truer selfconfidence, a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of courage, and a magnanimity and
perseverance such as cannot, as a rule, be acquired in the lower world.
The candidate may always turn back after the fire-trial. He will then
resume his life, strengthened in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul, and wait for a future
incarnation to continue his initiation. In his present incarnation he will
prove himself a more useful member of <span class="t5 t11 hoverable">society</span> and of humanity than he
was before. In whatever position he may <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> himself, his firmness,
prudence, resoluteness, and his beneficent influence over his fellows will
have greatly increased.
But if, after completing the fire-trial, he should wish to continue the path,
a certain writing-system generally adopted in esoteric training must now
be revealed to him. The actual teachings manifest themselves in this
writing, because the hidden (occult) qualities of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> cannot be directly
expressed in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of ordinary writing. The pupils of the initiates
translate the teachings into ordinary language as best they can. The occult
script reveals itself to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when the latter has attained <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
perception, for it is traced in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and remains there for all
time. It cannot be learned as an artificial writing is learned and read. The
candidate grows into clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in an appropriate way, and
during this growth in a new strength is developed in his soul, as a new
faculty, through which he feels himself impelled to decipher the
occurrences and the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> like the characters of a
writing. This strength, with the experience it brings of the corresponding
trial, might possibly awaken in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of its own accord, as the

41

soul continually develops, but it will be found safer to follow the
instructions of those who are spiritually experienced, and who have some
proficiency in deciphering the occult script.
The signs of the occult script are not arbitrarily invented; they correspond
to the forces actively engaged in the world. They teach us the language of
things. It becomes immediately apparent to the candidate that the signs he
is now learning correspond to the forms, colors, and tones which he
learned to perceive during his preparation and enlightenment. He realizes
that all he learned previously was only like learning to spell, and that he is
only now beginning to read in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. All the isolated figures,
tones, and colors reveal themselves to him now in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> connected
whole. Now for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he attains complete certainty in observing
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. Hitherto he could never know positively <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he saw were rightly seen. A regular understanding, too, is now at
last possible between the candidate and the initiate in the spheres of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge. For whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the intercourse between an initiate and
another <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> in ordinary life, the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> in its
immediate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> can only be imparted by the initiate in the abovementioned sign-language.
Thanks to this language the student also learns certain rules of conduct and
certain duties of which he formerly knew nothing. Having learned these he
is able to perform actions endowed with a significance and a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> such
as the actions of one not initiated can never possess. He acts out of the
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. Instructions concerning such action can only be read and
understood in the writing in question.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it must be emphasized that there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> unconsciously gifted with
the ability and faculty of performing such actions, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> they have never
undergone an esoteric training. Such helpers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and of humanity

For
reasons here not to be discussed, gifts have been bestowed on them which
appear supernatural. What distinguishes them from the candidate for
initiation is only that the latter acts consciously and with <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> insight into
the entire situation. He acquires by training the gifts bestowed on others
by <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> of humanity. We can sincerely revere these
favored of God; but we should not for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> regard the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
esoteric training as superfluous.
Once the student has learned the sign-language there awaits him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>

be diverted from his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> by becoming an esoteric student. On the
contrary, all the qualities which make a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being capable and efficient
are enhanced in the student to a degree incomprehensible to the
uninitiated. If, in the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> of the uninitiated, this does not always appear to
be the case, it is simply because he often lacks the ability to judge the
initiate correctly. The deeds of the latter are not always intelligible to the
former. But this only happens in special cases.
At this stage of initiation there are duties to be performed for which no
outward stimulus is given. The candidate will not be moved to action by
external pressure, but only through adherence to the rules of conduct
revealed to him in the occult script. He must now show in this <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> trial
that, led by such rules, he can act with the same firmness and precision
with which, for instance, an official performs the duties that belong to
him. For this purpose, and in the course of his further training, he will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
himself faced by a certain definite task. He must perform some action in
consequence of observations made on the basis of what he has learned
during preparation and enlightenment. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this action can be
understood by means of the occult script with which he is now familiar. If
he recognizes his duty and acts rightly, his trial has been successful. The
success can be recognized in the alteration produced by his action in the
figures, colors, and tones apprehended by his <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and ears. Exact
indications are given, as the training progresses, showing how these
figures appear and are experienced after the action has been performed,
and the candidate must know how to produce this change. This trial is
known as the Water-Trial, because in his activity in these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds
the candidate is deprived of the support derived from outward
circumstances, as a swimmer is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> support when swimming in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span>
that is beyond his depth. This activity must be repeated until the candidate
attains absolute poise and assurance.
The importance of this trial lies again in the acquisition of a quality.
Through his experiences in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, the candidate develops this
quality in a short <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to such a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> degree that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> otherwise have
to go through many incarnations, in the ordinary course of his
development, before he could acquire it to the same extent. It all centers
around the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that he must be guided only by the results of his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
perception and reading of the occult script, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to produce the changes
in question in these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> regions of existence. Should he, in the course
of his activity, introduce any of his own opinions and desires, or should he

43

diverge for one moment from the laws which he has recognized to be
right, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to follow his own willful inclination, then the result
produced <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> differ entirely from what was intended. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lose
sight of the goal to which his action tended, and confusion <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result.
Hence ample opportunity is given him in the course of this trial to develop
self-control. This is the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> in view. Here again, this trial can be more
easily passed by those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> life, before initiation, has led them to acquire
self-control. Anyone having acquired the faculty of following <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span>
principles and ideals, while putting into the background all personal
predilection; anyone capable of always performing his duty, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>

such a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is unconsciously an initiate in the midst of ordinary life. He
will need but little to succeed in this particular trial. Indeed, a certain
measure of initiation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> unconsciously acquired in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> will, as a rule, be
indispensable for success in this <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> trial. For even as it is difficult for
those who have not learned to spell correctly in their childhood to make

the necessary degree of self-control at the moment of looking into the
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, if this ability has not been acquired to a certain degree in
ordinary life. The objects of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> do not alter, whatever the

however, our wishes, desires, and inclinations are causes that produce
effects. If we wish to produce a particular effect in these worlds, we must
strictly follow the right rules and subdue every arbitrary impulse.
One <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> quality is of very special importance at this stage of initiation,
namely, an unquestionably sound judgment. Attention should be paid to
the training of this faculty during all the previous stages; for it now
remains to be proved <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the candidate is shaping in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that shows
him to be fit for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> path of knowledge. Further progress is now only
possible if he is able to distinguish illusion, superstition, and everything
fantastic, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> reality. This is, at first, more difficult to accomplish in
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> stages of existence than in the lower. Every prejudice, every
cherished opinion with regard to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> in question, must vanish; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span>
alone must guide. There must be perfect readiness to abandon at once any
idea, opinion, or inclination when logical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> demands it. Certainty in
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds is only likely to be attained when personal opinion is never
considered.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> mode of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> tends to fancifulness and superstition can
never make progress on the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. It is indeed a

<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds is removed from him. With all their laws they reveal
themselves to his gaze. But he cannot acquire this treasure so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he is

portal leading to the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> trial of initiation, and because over the portal
at the entrance to the first trial he read: <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> normal common <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> all

him. He finds here no definite goal to be reached. All is <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> in his own
hands. He finds himself in a situation where nothing impels him to act. He
must <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> all alone and out of himself. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to
stimulate him to action are non-existent. Nothing and nobody can give him
the strength he needs but he himself alone. Failure to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> this inner
strength will leave him standing where he was. Few of those, however,
who have successfully passed the previous trials will fail to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the
necessary strength at this point. Either they will have turned back already
or they succeed at this point also. All that the candidate requires is the
ability to come quickly to terms with himself, for he must here <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self in the truest <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the word. He must rapidly decide in all

further acquaintance with these mattes, should feel an antipathy for this
principle of being thrown back on oneself, for success in this trial brings
with it a moment of supreme happiness.
At this stage, no less than at the others, ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is itself an esoteric
training for many. For anyone having reached the point of being able,
when suddenly confronted with some task or problem in life, to come to a
swift decision <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hesitation or delay, for him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> itself has been a
training in this sense. Such situations are here meant in which success is
instantly lost if action is not rapid. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who is quick to act when a
misfortune is imminent, whereas a few moments of hesitation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have
seen the misfortune an accomplished fact, and who has turned this ability
into a permanent personal quality, has unconsciously acquired the degree
of maturity necessary for the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> trial. For at this stage everything centers
round the development of absolute presence of mind. This trial is known

45

as the Air-Trial, because while undergoing it the candidate can support
himself neither <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the firm basis of external incentive nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
figures, tones, and colors which he has learned at the stages of preparation
and enlightenment, but exclusively <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> himself.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> successfully passing this trial the student is permitted to enter the
temple of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> wisdom. All that is here said on this subject can only be
the slenderest allusion. The task now to be performed is often expressed in
the statement that the student must <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> an oath never to betray anything
he has learned. These expressions, however, “oath” and “betray”, are
inappropriate and actually misleading. There is no question of an oath in
the ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the word, but rather of an experience that comes at
this stage of development. The candidate learns how to apply the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge, how to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> it at the service of humanity. He then begins
really and truly to understand the world. It is not so much a question of
withholding the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truths, but far more of serving them in the right
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and with the necessary tact. The silence he is to keep refers to
something quite different. He acquires this fine quality with regard to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he had previously spoken, and especially with regard to the manner
in which they were spoken. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be a poor initiate who did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
all the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> he had acquired at the service of humanity, as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> and as far as this is possible. The only obstacle to giving information
in these matters is the lack of understanding on the part of the recipients. It
is true, of course, that the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> does not lend itself to
promiscuous talk; but no one having reached the stage of development
described above is actually forbidden to say anything. No other person, no
being exacts an oath from him with this intent. Everything is <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to his
own responsibility, and he learns in every situation to discover <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
himself what he has to do, and an oath means nothing more than that he
has been found qualified to be entrusted with such a responsibility.
If the candidate is found fit for the foregoing experiences, he is then given
what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> symbolically the draught of forgetfulness. This means that
he is initiated into the secret <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that enables him to act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
being continually disturbed by the lower memory. This is necessary for the
initiate, for he must have <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the immediate present. He must be
able to destroy the veil of memory which envelops <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> every moment of
his life. If we judge something that happens to us today according to the
experience of yesterday, we are exposed to a multitude of errors. Of
course this does not mean that experience gained in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> should be
renounced. It should always be kept in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> as clearly as possible. But the
initiate must have the ability to judge every new experience wholly
according to what is inherent in it, and let it react <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, unobscurred
by the past. We must be prepared at every moment that every <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> and
every being can <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> to us some new revelation. If we judge the new by
the standard of the old we are liable to error. The memory of past

46

experiences will be of greatest <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> for the very <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that it enables us to
perceive the new. Had we not gone through a definite experience we
should perhaps be blind to the qualities of the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> or being that comes
before us. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> experience should serve the purpose of perceiving the new
and not of judging it by the standard of the old. In this respect the initiate
acquires certain definite qualities, and thereby many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are revealed to
him which remain concealed from the uninitiated.
The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> draught presented to the initiate is the draught of
remembrance. Through its agency he acquires the faculty of retaining the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truths ever present in his soul. Ordinary memory
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be unequal to this task. We must unite ourselves and become as one
with the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truths.
We must not only know them, but be able, quite as a matter of course, to
manifest and administer them in living actions, even as we ordinarily <span class="t6 hoverable">eat</span>
and drink. They must become our practice, our habit, our inclination.
There must be no need to keep thinking about them in the ordinary sense;
they must come to living expression through <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> himself; they must flow
through him as the functions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> through his organism. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> doth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
ever raise himself, in a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> sense, to that same stature to which

IV
Some Practical Aspects
The training of thoughts and feelings, pursued in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described in the
chapters on Preparation, Enlightenment, and Initiation, introduces into the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> the same organic symmetry with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has
constructed the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. Before this development, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> are
undifferentiated masses. The clairvoyant perceives them as interlacing,
rotating, cloud-like spirals, dully glimmering in reddish, reddish-brown, or
reddish-yellow tones. After this training they begin to assume a brilliant
yellowish-green, or greenish-blue color, and show a regular structure. This
inner regularity leading to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, is attained when the student
introduces into his thoughts and feelings the same orderly system with
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> has endowed his bodily organs that enable him to see, hear,
digest, breath, speak. Gradually he learns to breath and see with this soul,
to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> and hear with the spirit.
In the following pages some practical aspects of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> education of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> will be treated in greater detail. They are such that anyone
can put them into practice regardless of other rules, and thereby be led
some distance further into <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science.
A particular effort must be made to cultivate the quality of patience. Every
symptom of impatience produces a paralyzing, even a destructive effect on
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> faculties that slumber in us. We must not expect an
immeasurable <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds from one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to the next, for we
should assuredly be disappointed. Contentment with the smallest fragment
attained, repose and tranquility, must more and more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> possession of
the soul. It is quite understandable that the student should await results
with impatience; but he will achieve nothing so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he fails to <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span>
this impatience. Nor is it of any <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> to combat this impatience merely in
the ordinary sense, for it will become only that much stronger. We overlook it in self-deception while it plants itself all the more firmly in the
depths of the soul. It is only when we ever and again surrender ourselves
to a certain definite thought, making it absolutely our own, that any results
can be attained. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is as follows: I must certainly do everything I
can for the training and development of my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit; but I shall wait
patiently until <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers shall have found me worthy of definite
enlightenment. If this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> becomes so powerful in the student that it
grows into an actual feature of his character, he is treading the right path.
This feature soon sets its mark on his exterior. The gaze of his eye
becomes steady, the movement of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> becomes sure, his decisions
definite, and all that goes under the name of nervousness gradually
disappears. Rules that appear trifling and insignificant must be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> into
account. For example, supposing someone affronts us. Before our training
48

we should have directed our resentment against the offender; a wave of
anger <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have surged up <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> us. In a similar case, however, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is immediately present in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the student that such an
affront makes no difference to his intrinsic worth. And he does whatever
must be done to meet the affront with calm and composure, and not in a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of anger. Of course it is not a <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of simply accepting every affront,
but of acting with the same calm composure when dealing with an affront
against our own <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> if the affront were directed against
another person, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> favor we had the right to intervene. It must
always be remembered that this training is not carried out in crude
outward processes, but in subtle, silent alterations in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
and feeling.
Patience has the effect of attraction, impatience the effect of repulsion on
the treasures of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. In the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> regions of existence
nothing can be attained by haste and unrest. Above all things, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> and
craving must be silenced, for these are qualities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> before which
all <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> shyly withdraws. However precious this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
is accounted, the student must not crave it if he wishes to attain it. If he
wishes to have it for his own sake, he will never attain it. This requires
him to be honest with himself in his innermost soul. He must in no <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> be
under any illusion concerning his own self. With a feeling of inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> he
must look his own faults, weaknesses, and unfitness <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> in the face. The
moment he tries to excuse to himself any of his weaknesses, he has placed
a stone in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> on the path which is to lead him upward. Such obstacles
can only be removed by self-enlightenment. There is only one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to get
rid of faults and failings, and that is by a clear recognition of them.
Everything slumbers in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and can be awakened. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span>
can even improve his intellect and reason, if he quietly and calmly makes
it clear to himself why he is weak in this respect. Such self- <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is,
of course, difficult, for the temptation to self-deception is immeasurably
great. Anyone making a habit of being truthful with himself opens the
portal leading to a deeper insight.
All curiosity must fall away from the student. He must rid himself as much
as possible of the habit of asking questions merely for the sake of
gratifying a selfish thirst for knowledge. He must only ask when
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can serve to perfect his own being in the service of evolution.
Nevertheless, his delight in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and his devotion to it should in no
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be hampered. He should listen devoutly to all that contributes to such
an end, and should seek every opportunity for such devotional attention.
Special attention must be paid in esoteric training to the education of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of desires. This does not mean that we are to become <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> of desire, for
if we are to attain something we must also <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> it, and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> will always
tend to fulfillment if backed by a particular force. This force is derived

49

from a right knowledge. Do not <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> at all until you know what is right
in any one sphere. That is one of the golden rules for the student. The <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> first ascertains the laws of the world, and then his desires become
powers which realize themselves. The following example brings this out
clearly. There are certainly many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> like to learn from
their own observation something about their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> before birth. Such a
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> is altogether useless and leads to no result so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> in
question has not acquired a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the laws that govern the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
of the eternal, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of these laws in their subtlest and most
intimate character, through the study of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science. But if, having
really acquired this knowledge, he wishes to proceed further, his desire,
now ennobled and purified, will enable him to do so.
It is also no <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> saying: I particularly wish to examine my previous life,
and shall study only for this purpose. We must rather be capable of
abandoning this desire, of eliminating it altogether, and of studying, at
first, with no such intention. We should cultivate a feeling of joy and
devotion for what we learn, with no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of the above end in view. We
should learn to cherish and foster a particular <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that it
brings with it its own fulfillment.
If we become angered, vexed or annoyed, we erect a wall around
ourselves in the soul-world, and the forces which are to develop the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span>
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> cannot approach. For instance, if a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> angers me he sends
forth a psychic current into the soul-world. I cannot see this current as
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as I am myself capable of anger. My own anger conceals it from me.
We must not, however, suppose that when we are <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from anger we shall
immediately have a psychic (astral) vision. For this purpose an organ of
vision must have been developed in the soul. The beginnings of such an
organ are latent in every <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, but remain ineffective as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he
is capable of anger. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> this organ is not immediately present the moment
anger has been combated to a small extent. We must rather persevere in
this combating of anger and proceed patiently on our way; then some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>
we shall <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that this eye of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has become developed. Of course,
anger is not the only failing to be combated for the attainment of this end.
Many grow impatient or skeptical, because they have for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> combated
certain qualities, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> clairvoyance has not ensued. In that <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> they
have just trained some qualities and allowed others to run riot. The gift of
clairvoyance only manifests itself when all those qualities which stunt the
growth of the latent faculties are suppressed. Undoubtedly, the beginnings
of such seeing and hearing may appear at an earlier period, but these are
only young and tender shoots which are subjected to all possible error, and
which, if not carefully tended and guarded, may quickly die.
Other qualities which, like anger and vexation, have to be combated, are
timidity, superstition, prejudice, vanity and ambition, curiosity, the mania

50

for imparting information, and the making of distinctions in <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span>
according to the outward characteristics of rank, sex, race, and so forth. In
our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> it is difficult for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> to understand how the combating of such
qualities can have anything to do with the heightening of the faculty of
cognition. But every <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist knows that much more depends
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> such matters than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the increase of <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> and employment
of artificial exercises. Especially can misunderstanding arise if we believe
that we must become foolhardy in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to be fearless; that we must close
our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> to the differences between people, because we must combat the
prejudices of rank, race, and so forth. Rather is it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that a correct
estimate of all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> is to be attained only when we are no longer
entangled in prejudice. Even in the ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> of
some phenomenon prevents us from estimating it rightly; that a racial
prejudice prevents us from seeing into a man's soul. It is this ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> that the student must develop in all its delicacy and subtlety.
Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> spoken <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> having been thoroughly purged in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is a
stone thrown in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of esoteric training. And here something must be
considered which can only be explained by giving an example. If anything
be said to which we must reply, we must be careful to consider the
speaker's opinion, feeling, and even his prejudice, rather than what we
ourselves have to say at the moment on the subject under discussion. In
this example a refined quality of tact is indicated, to the cultivation of
which the student must devote his care. He must learn to judge what
importance it may have for the other <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> if he opposes the latter's
opinion with his own. This does not mean that he must withhold his
opinion. There can be no question of that. But he must listen to the speaker
as carefully and as attentively as he possibly can and let his reply derive its
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> from what he has just heard. In such cases one particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
recurs ever and again to the student, and he is treading the right path if this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> lives with him to the extent of becoming a trait of his character.
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is as follows: The importance lies not in the difference of our
opinions but in his discovering through his own effort what is right if I
contribute something toward it. Thoughts of this and of a similar <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
cause the character and the behavior of the student to be permeated with a
quality of gentleness, which is one of the chief means <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in all esoteric
training. Harshness scares away the soul-pictures that should open the eye
of the soul; gentleness clears the obstacles away and unseals the inner
organs.
Along with gentleness, another quality will presently be developed in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of the student: that of quietly paying attention to all the subtleties in
the soul-life of his environment, while reducing to absolute silence any
activity <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> his own soul. The soul-life of his environment will impress
itself on him in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> will grow, and as it grows,
become regular in its structure, as a plant expanding in the sunlight.

Gentleness and patient reserve open the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the soul-world and the

senses to all that they <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> you before your training; reduce to absolute
immobility all the thoughts which, according to your previous habits,
surged <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> you; become quite still and silent within, wait in patience,

see and hear in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit, for all that you are doing does
but contribute to the development of your <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> senses, and you will only
be able to hear with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> when you possess these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> senses.
Having persevered for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> in silent inner seclusion, go about your
customary daily affairs, imprinting deeply <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> this thought:
“Some day, when I have grown sufficiently, I shall attain that which I am
destined to attain,” and make no attempt to attract forcefully any of these
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers to yourself. Every student receives these instructions at the
outset. By observing them he perfects himself. If he neglects them, all his
labor is in vain. But they are only difficult of achievement for the
impatient and the unpersevering. No other obstacles exist save those
which we ourselves <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in our own path, and which can be avoided by
all who really will. This point must be continually emphasized, because
many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an altogether wrong conception of the difficulties that
beset the path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. It is easier, in a certain sense, to
accomplish the first steps along this path than to get the better of the
commonest every-day difficulties <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> this training. Apart from this,

lead more quickly to the goal, but what is here explained has nothing to do
with them, because they have certain effects which no experienced
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist considers desirable. Since fragmentary information
concerning these ways is continually finding its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> into publicity,

Something may here be said concerning the environment in which this
training should be undertaken, for this is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> some importance.

environment filled only with self-seeking interests, as for example, the
modern struggle for existence, must be conscious of the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that these
interests are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> their effect on the development of his <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
organs. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the inner laws of these organs are so powerful that
this influence cannot be fatally injurious. Just as a lily can never grow into

52

a thistle, however inappropriate its environment, so, too, the eye of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> can never grow to anything but its destined shape even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it be
subjected to the self-seeking interests of modern cities. But under all
circumstances it is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> if the student seeks, now and again, his
environment in the restful peace, the inner dignity and sweetness of
nature. Especially fortunate is the student who can carry out his esoteric
training surrounded by the green <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of plants, or among the sunny hills,
where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> weaves her web of sweet simplicity. This environment
develops the inner organs in a harmony which can never ensue in a
modern city. More favorably situated than the townsman is the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span>
who, during his childhood at least, had been able to breathe the fragrance
of pines, to gaze on snowy peaks, and observe the silent activity of
woodland creatures and insects. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> no city-dweller should fail to give to
the organs of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit, as they develop, the nurture that comes
from the inspired teachings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> research. If our <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> cannot follow
the woods in their mantel of green every spring, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> by day, we should
instead open our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to the glorious teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, or of
St. John's Gospel, or of St. Thomas à Kempis, and to the descriptions
resulting from <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science. There are many ways to the summit of
insight, but much depends on the right choice. The spiritually experienced
could say much concerning these paths, much that might seem strange to
the uninitiated. Someone, for instance, might be very far advanced on the
path; he might be standing, so to speak, at the very entrance of sight and
hearing with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and spirit; he is then fortunate enough to make a journey
over the calm or maybe tempestuous ocean, and a veil falls away from the
<span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> of his soul; suddenly he becomes a seer. Another is also so far
advanced that this veil only needs to be loosened; this occurs through
some stroke of destiny. On another this stroke might <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> have had the
effect of paralyzing his powers and undermining his energy; for the
esoteric student it becomes the occasion of his enlightenment. A <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
perseveres patiently for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any marked result. Suddenly, while
silently seated in his quiet chamber, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> envelops him; the walls
disappear, become transparent for his soul, and a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> expands
before his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> that have become seeing, or resounds in his ears that have
become spiritually hearing.

V
The Conditions of Esoteric Training
The conditions attached to esoteric training are not arbitrary. They are the
natural outcome of esoteric knowledge. Just as no one can become a
painter who refuses to handle a paint-brush, so, too, no one can receive
esoteric training who is unwilling to meet the demands considered
necessary by the teacher. In the main, the latter can give nothing but
advice, and everything he says should be accepted in this sense. He has
already passed through the preparatory stages leading to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, and knows from experience what is necessary. It
depends entirely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the free-will of each <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being
<span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> or not he choose to tread the same path. To insist on being
admitted to esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fulfilling the conditions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be
equivalent to saying: “Teach me how to paint, but do not ask me to handle
a paint-brush.” The teacher can never offer anything unless the recipient
comes forward to meet him of his own free-will. But it must be
emphasized that a general <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is not sufficient.
This <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> will, of course, be felt by many, but nothing can be achieved
by it alone so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the special conditions attached to esoteric training
are not accepted. This point should be considered by those who complain
that the training is difficult. Failure or unwillingness to fulfill these strict
conditions must entail the abandonment of esoteric training, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
being. It is true, the conditions are strict, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they are not harsh, since their
fulfillment not only should be, but indeed must be a voluntary action.
If this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> be overlooked, esoteric training can easily appear in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of
a coercion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the conscience; for the training is based on the
development of the inner life, and the teacher must necessarily give advice
concerning this inner life. But there is no question of compulsion when a
demand is met out of <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> choice. To ask of the teacher: “Give me your
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, but leave me my customary emotions, feelings, and
thoughts,” <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be an impossible demand. In this <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> the gratification of
curiosity and <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the only motive. When
pursued in such a spirit, however, <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> can never be attained.
Let us now consider in turn the conditions imposed on the student. It
should be emphasized that the complete fulfillment of any one of these
conditions is not insisted upon, but only the corresponding effort. No one
can wholly fulfill them, but everyone can start on the path toward them. It
is the effort of will that matters, and the ready disposition to enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
this path.
1. The first condition is that the student should pay heed to
the advancement of bodily and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> health. Of course,

health does not depend, in the first instance, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
individual; but the effort to improve in this respect lies
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the scope of all.

proceed from sound <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. The unhealthy are not
rejected, but it is demanded of the student that he should
have the will to lead a healthy life. In this respect he must
attain the greatest possible independence. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
counsels of others, freely bestowed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> generally
unsought, are as a rule superfluous. Each must endeavor to

more a question of warding off harmful influences than of
anything else. In fulfilling our duties we must often do
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that are detrimental to our health. We must decide at
the right moment to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> duty <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than the care of our
health. But just think how much can be avoided with a little
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will. Duty must in many cases stand <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than
health, often, even, than <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> itself; but pleasure must never
stand higher, as far as the student is concerned. For him
pleasure can only be a means to health and to life, and in
this connection we must, above all, be honest and truthful
with ourselves. There is no <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> in leading an ascetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
when the underlying motive is the same in this <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> as in
other enjoyments. Some may derive satisfaction from
asceticism just as others can from wine-bibbing, but they
must not imagine that this sort of asceticism will assist
them in attaining <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. Many ascribe to their
circumstances everything which apparently prevents them
from making progress. They say they cannot develop
themselves under their conditions of life. Now, many may
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> it desirable for other reasons to change their conditions
of life, but no one need do so for the purpose of esoteric
training. For the latter, a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> need only do as much as
possible, whatever his position, to further the health of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul. Every <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> can serve the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of
humanity; and it is a surer sign of greatness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> to
perceive clearly how necessary for this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> is a petty,
perhaps even an offensive employment than to think: “This
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> enough for me; I am destined for
something better.” Of special importance for the student is
the striving for complete health of mind. An unhealthy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling will not fail to obstruct the path to
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. Clear, calm thinking, with stability of
feeling and emotion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> here the basis of all work.
Nothing should be further removed from the student than
an inclination toward a fantastical, excitable life, toward
nervousness, exaggeration, and fanaticism. He should

55

acquire a healthy outlook on all circumstances of life; he
should meet the demands of lie with steady assurance,
quietly letting all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> make their impression on him and
reveal their message. He should be at pains to do justice to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> on every occasion. All one-sided and extravagant
tendencies in his sentiments and criticisms should be
avoided. Failing this, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> merely into
worlds of his own imagination, instead of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds; in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of truth, his own pet opinions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> assert
themselves. It is better for the student to be matter-of-fact,
than excitable and fantastic.
2. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> condition is that the student should feel
himself co-ordinated as a link in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of life. Much is
included in the fulfillment of this condition, but each can
only fulfill it in his own manner. If I am a teacher, and my
pupil does not fulfill my expectations, I must not divert my
resentment against him but against myself. I must feel
myself as one with my pupil, to the extent of asking myself:
“Is my pupil's deficiency not the result of my own action?”
Instead of directing my feelings against him I shall rather
reflect on my own attitude, so that the pupil may in the
future be better able to satisfy my demands. Proceeding
from such an attitude, a change will come over the student's
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of thinking. This holds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> in all things, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
or small. Such an attitude of mind, for instance, alters the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> I regard a criminal. I suspend my judgment and say to
myself: “I am, like him, only a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. Through
favorable circumstances I received an education which
perhaps alone saved me from a similar fate.” I may then
also come to the conclusion that this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> brother of <span class="t6 hoverable">mine</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have become a different <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> had my teachers <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
the same pains with him they <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span> with me. I shall reflect
on the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that something was given to me which was
withheld from him, that I enjoy my fortune precisely
because it was denied him. And then I shall naturally come
to think of myself as a link in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of humanity and a
sharer in the responsibility for everything that occurs. This
does not imply that such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> should be immediately
translated into external acts of agitation. It should be
cherished in stillness <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the soul. Then quite gradually
it will <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> its mark on the outward demeanor of the student.
In such matters each can only begin by reforming himself.
It is of no avail, in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the foregoing thoughts, to
make general demands on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of humanity. It is easy
to decide what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> ought to be; but the student <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in

56

the depths, not on the surface. If <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> be quite
wrong to relate the demand here indicated with an external,
least of all political, demands; with such matters this
training can have nothing to do. Political agitators know, as
a rule, what to demand of other people; but they say little of
demands on themselves.
3. This brings us to the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> condition. The student must
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> upward to the realization that his thoughts
and feelings are as important for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as his actions.
It must be realized that it is equally injurious to hate a
fellow-being as to strike him. The realization will then
follow that by perfecting ourselves we accomplish
something not only for ourselves, but for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> world.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> derives equal benefit from our untainted feelings
and thoughts as from our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> demeanor, and as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as we
cannot believe in this cosmic importance of our inner life,
we are unfit for the path that is here described. We are only
filled with the right <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the significance of our inner
self, of our soul, when we <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> at it s <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it were at
least as real as all external things. We must admit that our
every feeling produces an effect, just as does every action
of our hand.
4. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> already express the fourth condition: to
acquire the conviction that the real being of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> does not
lie in his exterior but in his interior. Anyone regarding
himself as a product of the outer world, as a result of the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, cannot succeed in this esoteric training, for
the feeling that we are <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> forms its
very basis. The acquisition of this feeling renders the
student fit to distinguish between inner duty and outward
success. He learns that the one cannot be directly measured
by the other. He must <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the proper mean between what is
indicated by external conditions and what he recognizes as
the right conduct for himself. He should not force <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his
environment anything for which it can have no
understanding, but also he must be quite <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from the
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to do only what can be appreciated by those around
him. The voice of his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> struggling honestly toward
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> him the one and only recognition of
the truths for which he stands. But he must learn as much
as he possibly can from his environment so as to discover
what those around him need, and what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> for them. In
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he will develop <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself what is known in

for the needs of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> lies on one of the scales,
and inner fortitude and unfaltering endurance on the other.
5. This brings us to the fifth condition: steadfastness in
carrying out a resolution. Nothing should induce the
student to deviate from a resolution he may have taken,
save only the perception that he was in error. Every
resolution is a force, and if this force does not produce an
immediate effect at the point to which it was applied, it
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> nevertheless on in its own way. Success is only
decisive when an action arises from desire. But all actions
arising from <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> are worthless in relation to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds. There, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for an action is alone the decisive
factor. In this love, every impulse that impels the student to
action should fulfill itself. Undismayed by failure, he will
never grow weary of endeavoring repeatedly to translate
some resolution into action. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he reaches the
stage of not waiting to see the outward effect of his actions,
but of contenting himself with performing them. He will
learn to <span class="t3 t5 t10 t16 t23 t26 t29 hoverable">sacrifice</span> his actions, even his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> being, to the
world, however the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> may receive his sacrifice.
Readiness for a sacrifice, for an <span class="t6 hoverable">offering</span> such as this, must
be shown by all who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> pursue the path of esoteric
training.
6. A sixth condition is the development of a feeling of
thankfulness for everything with which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> is favored. We
must realize that our existence is a gift from the entire
universe. How much is needed to enable each one of us to
receive and maintain his existence! How much to we not
owe to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and to our fellow <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings! Thoughts
such as these must come naturally to all who seek esoteric
training, for if the latter do not feel inclined to entertain
them, they will be incapable of developing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
themselves that all-embracing <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> which is necessary for
the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. Nothing can reveal
itself to us which we do not love. And every revelation
must fill us with thankfulness, for we ourselves are the
richer for it.
7. All these conditions must be united in a seventh: to
regard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> unceasingly in the manner demanded by these
conditions. The student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> makes it possible to give his
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> the stamp of uniformity. All his modes of expression
will, in this way, be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> into harmony, and no longer
contradict each other. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> he will prepare himself for

58

the inner tranquillity he must attain during the preliminary
steps of his training.
Anyone sincerely showing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will to fulfill these conditions may
decide to seek esoteric training. He will then be ready to follow the advice
given above. Much of his advice may appear to be merely on the surface,
and many will perhaps say that they did not expect the training to proceed
in such strict forms. But everything interior must manifest itself in an
exterior way, and just as a picture is not evident when it exists only in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the painter, so, too, there can be no esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
outward expression. Disregard for strict forms is only shown by those who
do not know that the exterior is the avenue of expression for the interior.
No doubt it is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> that really matters, and not the form; but just as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is null and void, so also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> remain inactive if
it did not create for itself a form.
The above conditions are calculated to render the student strong enough to
fulfill the further demands made on him during this training. If he fail in
these conditions he will hesitate before each new demand, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
them he will lack that <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> which he must possess. For all striving
for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> must be founded on <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for man. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span>
this is the foundation it is not the source of all striving for truth, for such
striving can only flow from the soul's own fountain-head of strength. And
the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> must gradually widen to a <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for all living creatures,
yes, for all existence. Through failure to fulfill the condition here given,
the student will lack the perfect <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> for everything that fashions and
creates, and the inclination to refrain from all destruction as such. He must
so train himself that not only in his actions but also in his words, feelings,
and thoughts he will never destroy anything for the sake of destruction.
His joy must be in growth and life, and he must only lend his <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> to
destruction, when he is also able, through and by means of destruction, to
promote new life. This does not mean that the student must simply look on
while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> runs riot, but rather that he must seek even in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> that side
through which he may transform it into good. He will then see more and
more clearly that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and imperfection may best be combated by the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> and the perfect. The student knows that out of
nothing, nothing can be created, but also that the imperfect can be
transformed into the perfect. Anyone developing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself the
disposition to create, will soon <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> himself capable of facing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> in the
right way.
It must be clearly realized that the purpose of this training is to build and
not to destroy. The student should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> with him the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> will
for sincere and devoted work, and not the intention to criticize and
destroy. He should be capable of devotion, for he must learn what he does
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> know; he should look reverently on that which discloses itself.

59

Work and devotion, these are the fundamental qualities which must be
demanded of the student. Some come to realize that they are making no
progress, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in their own opinion they are untiringly active. The
<span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> is that they have not grasped the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and devotion in
the right way. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Work</span> done for the sake of success will be the least
successful, and learning pursued <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> devotion will be the least
conducive to progress. Only the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of work, and not of success, leads to
progress. And if in learning the student seeks straight thinking and sound
judgment, he need not stunt his devotion by doubts and suspicions.
We are not reduced to service subjection in listening to some information
with quiet devotion and because we do not at once oppose it with our own
opinion. Anyone having advanced some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>

reflection, and not to willful personal judgment. We should always bear in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that we do not need to learn what we are already able to judge.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Therefore</span> if our sole intention is to judge, we can learn nothing more.
Esoteric training, however, center in learning; we must have absolutely the

not to judge than to judge adversely. We can wait until later for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span>
understanding. The <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> we climb the ladder of knowledge, the more do
we require the faculty of listening with quiet devotion. All perception of
truth, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and activity in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the spirit, become subtle and
delicate in comparison with the processes of the ordinary intellect and of

before us, the more delicate are the processes in which we are engaged. It
is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> arrive at such different opinions and points of
<span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> regions. But there is one and only one opinion
regarding <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> truths and this one opinion is <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> reach of all who,

and contemplate it. Opinions differing from the one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> opinion can only
be arrived at when people, insufficiently prepared, judge in accordance
with their pet theories, their habitual ways of thought, and so forth. Just as
there is only one correct opinion concerning a mathematical problem, so

opinion can be reached, due preparation must first be undergone. If this
were only considered, the conditions attached to esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be

Some Results of Initiation
One of the fundamental principles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science is that the one

should attempt nothing and practice nothing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the
effect produced. A teacher of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science who gives advice or
instruction will, at the same time, always explain to those striving for

For only those who know such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as they are here communicated can

<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Without</span> the latter no genuine esoteric training is possible,
for it must be understood that all groping in the dark is discouraged, and
that failure to pursue this training with open <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> may lead to mediumship,
but not to exact clairvoyance in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science.
The exercises described in the preceding chapters, if practiced in the right
way, involve certain changes in the organism of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> (astral body). The
latter is only perceptible to the clairvoyant, and may be compared to a
cloud, psycho-spiritually luminous to a certain degree, in the center of
which the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is discernible. (A description will be found in the
author's book, Theosophy.) In this astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> desires, lusts, passions, and
ideas become visible in a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> way. Sensual appetites, for instance,
create the impression of a dark red radiance with a definite shape; a pure
and noble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> finds its expression in a reddish-violet radiance; the
clear-cut concept of the logical thinker is experienced as a yellowish
figure with sharply defined outline; the confused <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of the muddled
<span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> appears as a figure with vague outline. The thoughts of a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> with
one-sided, queer views appear sharply outlined but immobile, while the
thoughts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> accessible to the points of <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of others are seen to
have mobile, changeable outlines. (In all these and the following
descriptions it must be noted that by seeing a color, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> seeing is
meant. When the clairvoyant speaks of “seeing red,” he means: “I have an
experience, in a psycho-spiritual way, which is equivalent to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
experience when an impression of red is received.” This mode of
expression is here <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> because it is perfectly natural to the clairvoyant. If
this point is over-looked, a mere color-vision may easily be mistaken for a
genuine clairvoyant experience.)
The further the student advances in his inner development, the more
regular will be the differentiation <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> his astral body. The latter is
confused and undifferentiated in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> of undeveloped inner
62

life; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the clairvoyant can perceive even the unorganized astral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as a
figure standing out distinctly from its environment. It extends from the
center of the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> to the middle of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, and appears like an
independent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> possessing certain organs. The organs now to be
considered are perceptible to the clairvoyant near the following part of the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body: the first between the eyes; the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> near the larynx; the
<span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> in the region of the heart; the fourth in the so-called pit of the
stomach; the fifth and sixth are situated in the abdomen. These organs are
technically known as wheels, chakrams, or lotus flowers. They are so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> on <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of their likeness to wheels or flowers, but of course it
should be clearly understood that such an expression is not to be applied
more literally than is the term “wings” when referring to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> halves of
the lungs. Just as there is no question of wings in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the lungs, so,
too, in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of the lotus flowers the expression must be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
figuratively. In undeveloped persons these lotus flowers are dark in color,
motionless and inert. In the clairvoyant, however, they are luminous,
mobile, and of variegated color. Something of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> applies to the
medium, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in a different way; this question, however, need not be
pursued here any further.
Now, when the student begins his exercises, the lotus flowers become
more luminous; later on they begin to revolve. When this occurs,
clairvoyance begins. For these flowers are the sense-organs of the soul,
and their revolutions express the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the clairvoyant perceives
supersensibly. What was said previously concerning <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> seeing
applies equally to these revolutions and even to the lotus flowers
themselves. No one can perceive the supersensible until he has developed
his astral senses in this way. Thanks to the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organ situated in the
vicinity of the larynx, it becomes possible to survey clairvoyantly the
thoughts and mentality of other beings, and to obtain a deeper insight into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> laws of natural phenomena. The organ situated near the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span>
permits of clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the sentiments and disposition of
other souls. When developed, this organ also makes it possible to observe
certain deeper forces in animals and plants. By means of the organ in the
so-called pit of the stomach, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is acquired of the talents and
capacities of souls; by its means, too, the part played by animals, plants,
stones, metals, atmospheric phenomena and so on in the household of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> becomes apparent.
The organ in the vicinity of the larynx has sixteen petals or spokes; the one
in the region of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> twelve, and the one in the pit of the stomach ten.
Now certain activities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> are connected with the development of
these organs, and anyone devoting himself to them in a certain definite
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> contributes something to the development of the corresponding
organs. In the sixteen-petalled lotus, eight of its sixteen petals were

63

developed in the remote past during an earlier stage of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> himself contributed nothing to this development; he received them as
a gift from nature, at a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when his <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> was in a dull, dreamy
condition. At that stage of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution they were in active use, but
the manner of their activity was only compatible with that dull <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of
consciousness. As <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> became clearer and brighter, the petals
became obscured and ceased their activity. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> himself can now develop
the remaining eight petals by means of conscious exercises, and thereby
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> lotus flower becomes luminous and mobile. The acquisition of
certain faculties depends on the development of each one of the sixteen
petals. Yet, as already shown, only eight can be consciously developed;
the remainder then appear of their own accord.
The development proceeds in the following manner. The student must first
apply himself with care and attention to certain functions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
hitherto exercised by him in a careless and inattentive manner. There are
eight such functions. The first is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which ideas and conceptions
are acquired. In this respect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> usually allow themselves to be led by
chance alone. They see or hear one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> or another and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> their ideas
accordingly. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as this is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> the sixteen petals of the lotus
flower remain ineffective. It is only when the student begins to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> his
self-education in hand, in this respect, that the petals become effective. His
ideas and conceptions must be guarded; each single <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> should acquire
significance fore him; he should see it in a definite message instructing
him concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the outer world, and he should derive no
satisfaction from ideas devoid of such significance. He must govern his
mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> so that it becomes a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mirror of the outer world, and direct
his effort to the exclusion of incorrect ideas from his soul.
The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> of these functions is concerned with the control of resolutions.
The student must not resolve <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> even the most trifling act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wellfounded and thorough consideration. Thoughtless and meaningless actions
should be foreign to his nature. He should have well-considered grounds
for everything he does, and abstain from everything to which no
significant motive urges him.
The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> function concerns speech. The student should utter no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> that
is devoid of <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> and meaning; all talking for the sake of talking draws
him away from his path. He must avoid the usual <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of conversation,
with its promiscuous discussion of indiscriminately varied topics. This
does not imply his preclusion from intercourse with his fellows. It is
precisely in such intercourse that his conversation should develop to
significance. He is ready to converse with everyone, but he does so
thoughtfully and with thorough deliberation. He never speaks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
grounds for what he says. He seeks to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> neither too many nor too few
words.

64

The fourth is the regulation of outward action. The student tries to adjust
his actions in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that they harmonize with the actions of his
fellow-men and with the events in his environment. He refrains from
actions which are disturbing to others and in conflict with his
surroundings. He seeks to adjust his actions so that they combine
harmoniously with his surroundings and with his position in life. When an
external motive causes him to act he considers how he can best respond.
When the impulse proceeds from himself he weighs with minute care the
effects of his activity.
The fifth function includes the management of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of life. The
student endeavors to live in conformity with both <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and spirit. Never
overhasty, he is also never indolent. Excessive activity and laziness are
equally alien to him. He looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as a means for <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and disposes
it accordingly. He regulates his habits and the care of his health in such a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that a harmonious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> is the outcome.
The sixth is concerned with <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> endeavor. The student tests his
capacities and proficiency, and conducts himself in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of such selfknowledge. He attempts nothing beyond his powers, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seems to omit
nothing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> their scope. On the other hand, he sets himself aims that
have to do with the ideals and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> duties of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. He does
not mechanically regard himself as a wheel in the vast machinery of
mankind but seeks to comprehend the tasks of his life, and to look out
beyond the limit of the daily and trivial. He endeavors to fulfill his
obligations ever better and more perfectly.
The seventh deals with the effort to learn as much from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> as possible.
Nothing passes before the student <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving him occasion to
accumulate experience which is of value to him for life. If he has
performed anything wrongly or imperfectly, he lets this be an incentive for
meeting the same contingency later on rightly and perfectly. When others
act he observes them with the same end in view. He tries to gather a rich
store of experience, ever returning to it for counsel; nor indeed will he
ever do anything <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> looking back on experiences from which he can
derive help in his decisions and affairs.
Finally, the eighth is as follows: The student must, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> to time,
glance introspectively into himself, sink back into himself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> counsel
with himself, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and test the fundamental principles of his life, run over
in his thoughts the sum total of his knowledge, weigh his duties, and
reflect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the content and aim of life. All these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> have been
mentioned in the preceding chapters; here they are merely recapitulated in
connection with the development of the sixteen-petalled lotus. By means
of these exercises the latter will become ever more and more perfect, for it
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> such exercises that the development of clairvoyance depends. The

65

better the student's thoughts and speech harmonize with the processes in
the outer world, the more quickly will he develop this faculty. Whoever
thinks and speaks what is contrary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> destroys something in the germ
of his sixteen-petalled lotus. Truthfulness, uprightness, and honesty are in
this connection creative forces, while mendacity, deceitfulness, and
dishonesty are destructive forces. The student must realize, however, that
actual deeds are needed, and not merely <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> intentions. If I think or say
anything that does not conform with reality, I kill something in my
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> I believe my intentions to be ever so good. It
is here as with the child which needs must burn itself when it touches fire,
even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> it did so out of ignorance. The regulation of the above
activities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the manner described causes the sixteen-petalled
lotus to shine in glorious hues, and imparts to it a definite movement. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span>
it must be noted that the faculty of clairvoyance cannot make its
appearance before a definite degree of development of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has been
reached. It cannot appear as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as it is irksome for the student to regulate
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in this manner. He is still unfit as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the activities described
above are a matter of special pre-occupation for him The first traces of
clairvoyance only appear when he has reached the point of being able to
live in the specified way, as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> habitually lives. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> must
then no longer be laborious, but must have become a matter of course.
There must be no need for him to be continually watching himself and
urging himself on to live in this way. It must all have become a matter of
habit.
Now this lotus flower may be made to develop in another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> by
following certain other instructions. But all such methods are rejected by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science, for they lead to the destruction of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> health
and to moral ruin. They are easier to follow than those here described. The
latter, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> protracted and difficult, lead to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> goal and cannot but
strengthen morally.
The distorted development of a lotus flower results not only in illusions
and fantastic conceptions, should a certain degree of clairvoyance be
acquired, but also in errors and instability in ordinary life. Such a
development may be the cause of timidity, envy, vanity, haughtiness,
willfulness and so on in a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who hitherto was <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> from these defects.
It has already been explained that eight of the sixteen petals of this lotus
flower were developed in a remote past, and that these will re-appear of
themselves in the course of esoteric development. All the effort and
attention of the student must be devoted to the remaining eight. Faulty
training may easily result in the re-appearance of the earlier petals alone,
while the new petals remain stunted. This will ensue especially if too little
logical, rational thinking is employed in the training. It is of supreme
importance that the student should be a rational and clear-thinking person,
and of further importance that he should practice the greatest clarity of

66

speech. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> who begin to have some presentiment of supersensible
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are apt to wax talkative on this subject, thereby retarding their
normal development. The less one talks about these matters the better.
Only someone who has achieved a certain degree of clarity should <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span>
about them. At the beginning of their instruction, students are as a rule
astonishes at the teacher's lack of curiosity concerning their own
experiences. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be much better for them to remain entirely silent on
this subject, and to content themselves with mentioning only <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> they
have been successful or unsuccessful in performing the exercises and
observing the instructions given them. For the teacher has quite other
means of estimating their progress than the students' own statements. The
eight petals now under consideration always become a little hardened
through such statements, whereas they should be kept soft and supple. The
following example taken, for the sake of clarity, not from the
supersensible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> but from ordinary life, will illustrate this point.
Suppose I hear a piece of news and thereupon immediately <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an
opinion. Shortly afterwards I receive some further news which does not
tally with the previous information. I am thereby obliged to reverse my
previous judgment. The result is an unfavorable influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> my
sixteen-petalled lotus. Quite the contrary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have been the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> had I,
in the first place, suspended judgment, and remained silent both inwardly
in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and outwardly in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> affair, until I had
acquired reliable grounds for forming my judgment. Caution in the
formation and pronouncement of judgments becomes, by degrees, the
special characteristic of the student. On the other <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> his receptivity for
impressions and experiences increases; he lets them <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> over him silently,
so as to collect and have the largest possible <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of facts at his
disposal when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> comes to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> his opinions. Bluish-red and
reddish-pink shades color the lotus flower as the result of such
circumspection, whereas in the opposite <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> dark red and orange shades
appear. (Students will recognize in the conditions attached to the
development of the sixteen-petalled lotus the instructions given by the
<span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> to his disciples for the Path. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> there is no question here of
teaching Buddhism, but of describing conditions governing development
which are the natural outcome of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science. The <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that these
conditions correspond with certain teachings of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> is no <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span>
for not finding them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in themselves.)
The twelve-petalled lotus situated in the region of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> is developed in
a similar way. Half its petals, too, were already existent and in active <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
in a remote stage of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> evolution. Hence these six petals need not now
be especially developed in esoteric training; they appear of themselves and
begin to revolve when the student sets to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> on the other six. Here again
he learns to promote this development by consciously controlling and
directing certain inner activities in a special way.

It must be clearly understood that the perceptions of each single organ of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or sprit bear a different character. The twelve and sixteen-petalled
lotus flowers transmit quite different perceptions. The latter perceives
forms. The thoughts and mentality of other <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and the laws governing
natural phenomena become manifest, through the sixteen-petalled lotus, as
figures, not rigid motionless figures but mobile forms filled with life. The
clairvoyant in whom this <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> is developed can describe, for every mode
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and for every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of nature, a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> which expresses them. A
revengeful thought, for example, assumes an arrow-like, pronged form,
while a kindly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is often formed like an opening flower, and so on.
Clear-cut, significant thoughts are regular and symmetrical in form, while
confused thoughts have wavy outlines. Quite different perceptions are
received through the twelve-petalled lotus. These perceptions may, in a
sense, be likened to warmth and cold, as applied to the soul. A clairvoyant
equipped with this faculty feels this warmth and cold streaming out from
the forms discerned by the sixteen-petalled lotus. Had he developed the
sixteen and not the twelve-petalled lotus he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> only perceive, in the
kindly thought, for instance, the figure described above, while a
clairvoyant in whom both senses were developed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> also notice what
can only be described as soul-warmth, flowing from the thought. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be noted in passing that esoteric training never develops one organ <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>
the other, so that the above-mentioned example may be regarded as a
hypothetical <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> in behalf of clarity. The twelve-petalled lotus, when
developed, reveals to the clairvoyant a deep understanding of the
processes of nature. Rays of soul-warmth issue from every manifestation
of growth and development, while everything in the process of decay,
destruction, ruin, gives an impression of cold.
The development of this <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> may be furthered in the following manner.
To begin with, the student endeavors to regulate his sequence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
(control of thought). Just as the sixteen-petalled lotus is developed by
cultivating thoughts that conform with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and are significant, so, too,
the twelve-petalled lotus is developed by inwardly controlling the trains of
thought. Thoughts that dart to and fro like will-o'-the-wisps and follow
each other in no logical or rational sequence, but merely by pure chance,
destroy its form. The closer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is made to follow <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> thought, and
the more strictly everything of illogical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is avoided, the more
suitable will be the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> this <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> organ develops. If the student hears
illogical thoughts he immediately lets the right thoughts <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through his
mind. He should not, however, withdraw in a loveless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from what is
perhaps an illogical environment in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to further his own development.
Neither should he feel himself impelled to correct all the illogical thoughts
expressed around him. He should rather silently co-ordinate the thoughts
as they pour in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him, and make them conform to logic and sense, and
at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> endeavor in every <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> to retain this same method in his
own thinking.

68

An equal consistency in his actions forms the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> requirement (control
of actions). All inconstancy, all disharmony of action, is baneful for the
lotus here in question. When the student performs some action he must see
to it that his succeeding action follows in logical sequence, for if he acts
from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> with variable intent he will never develop the faculty here
considered.
The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> requirement is the cultivation of endurance (perseverance). The
student is impervious to all influences which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> divert him from the
goal he has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> himself, as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as he can regard it as the right goal. For
him, obstacles contain a challenge that impels him to surmount them, but
never a <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> for giving up.
The fourth requirement is forbearance (tolerance) toward persons,
creatures, and also circumstances. The student suppresses all superfluous
criticism of everything that is imperfect, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and bad, and seeks rather to
understand everything that comes under his notice. Even as the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">sun</span> does
not withdraw its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> from the bad and the evil, so he, too, does not refuse
them an intelligent sympathy. Should some trouble befall him he does not
proceed to condemn and criticize, but accepts the inevitable, and
endeavors to the best of his ability to give the matter a turn for the best. He
does not consider the opinions of others merely from his own standpoint,
but seeks to put himself into the other's position.
The fifth requirement is impartiality toward everything that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> brings. In
this connection we <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and trust. The student meets every
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being and every creature with this trust, and lets it inspire his every
action. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> hearing some information, he never says to himself: “I don't
believe it; it contradicts my present opinions.” He is far rather ready to test
and rectify his views and opinions. He ever remains receptive for
everything that confronts him, and he trusts in the efficacy of his
undertakings. Timidity and skepticism are banished from his being. He
harbors a <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of his intentions. A hundred failures cannot
rob him of this faith. This is the “faith which can move mountains.”
The sixth requirement is the cultivation of a certain inner balance
(equanimity). The student endeavors to retain his composure in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of
joy and sorrow, and eradicates the tendency to fluctuate between the
seventh <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> of joy and the depths of despair. Misfortune and danger,
fortune and advancement alike <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> him ready armed.
The reader will recognize in the qualities here described the six attributes
which the candidate for initiation strives to acquire. The intention has been
to show their connection with the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organ known as the twelvepetalled lotus flower. As before, special instructions can be given to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span>
this lotus flower to fruition, but here again the perfect symmetry of its

69

form depends on the development of the qualities mentioned, the neglect
of which results in this organ being formed into a caricature of its proper
shape. In this case, should a certain clairvoyance be attained, the qualities
in question may <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> an <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> instead of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> direction. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> may
become intolerant, timid, or contentious toward his environment; may, for
instance, acquire some feeling for the sentiments of others, and for this
<span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> shun them or hate them. This may even reach the point where, by
<span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of the inner coldness that overwhelms him when he hears
repugnant opinions, he is unable to listen, or he may behave in an
objectionable manner.
The development of this organ may be accelerated if, in addition to all that
has been stated, certain other injunctions are observed which can only be
imparted to the student by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of mouth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the instructions given
above do actually lead to genuine esoteric training, and more-over, the
regulation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described can be advantageous to all who
cannot or will not undergo esoteric training. For it does not fail to produce
an effect <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the organism of the soul, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> slowly. As regards
the esoteric student, the observance of these principles is indispensable.
Should he attempt esoteric training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> conforming to them, this could
only result in his entering the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds with inadequate organs, and
instead of perceiving the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be subject to deceptions and
illusions. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> attain a certain clairvoyance, but for the most part, be
the victim of greater blindness than before. Formerly he at least stood
firmly <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world; now he looks beyond this <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
and grows confused about it before acquiring a firm footing in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
world. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of distinguishing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> from error <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> then perhaps

It is just for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span>
that patience is so necessary in these matters. It must ever be borne in

is compatible with the willing readiness shown to develop the lotus
flowers to their regular shape. Should these flowers be <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> to fruition

An inner training of a particularly intimate character is necessary for the
development of the ten-petalled lotus flower, for it is now a question of
learning consciously to control and dominate the sense-impressions
themselves. This is of particular importance in the initial stages of
clairvoyance, for it is only by this means that a source of countless
illusions and fancies is avoided. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> as a rule do not realize by what
factors their sudden ideas and memories are dominated, and how they are
produced. Consider the following case. Someone is traveling by railway;

recollects an experience that befell him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago and interweaves it with
his present thought. He did not notice that in looking through the window
he had caught sight of a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who resembled another intimately
connected with the recollected experience. He remains conscious, not of
what he saw, but of the effect it produced, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> believes that it all
came to him of its own accords. How much in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> occurs in such a way!

cannot bear a certain color, but does not realize that this is due to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>

have had a presentiment of it yesterday, although he had neither <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> nor

is quite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> occurred to him yesterday, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of its

yesterday, he <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to visit an acquaintance; a newspaper lay on the table;
he did not actually read it, but his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> unconsciously fell on the
announcement of the dangerous illness of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> in question. He
remained unconscious of the impression he had received, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> this
impression resulted in his presentiment.
Reflection <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> these matters will show how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> is the source of illusion
and fantasy contained in such associations. It is just this source which
must be dammed up by all who seek to develop their ten-petalled lotus
flower. Deeply hidden characteristics in other souls can be perceived by
this organ, but their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> depends on the attainment of immunity from the
above-mentioned illusions. For this purpose it is necessary that the student
should control and dominate everything that seeks to influence him from
outside. He should reach the point of really receiving no impressions
beyond those he wishes to receive. This can only be achieved by the
development of a powerful inner life; by an effort of the will he only
allows such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to impress him to which his attention is directed, and he
actually evades all impressions to which he does not voluntarily respond.
If he sees something it is because he wills to see it, and if he does not
voluntarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> notice of something it is actually non-existent for him.
The greater the energy and inner activity devoted to this work, the more
extensively will this faculty be attained. The student must avoid all
vacuous gazing and mechanical listening. For him only those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> exist
to which he turns his eye or his ear. He must practice the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of hearing
nothing, even in the greatest disturbance, if he does not will to hear; and
he must make his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> unimpressionable to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of which he does not
particularly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> notice. He must be shielded as by an inner armor against

71

all unconscious impressions. In this connection the student must devote
special care to his thought-life. He singles out a particular <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and
endeavors to link with it only such other thoughts as he can himself
consciously and voluntarily produce. He rejects all casual ideas and does
not connect this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> with another until he has investigated the origin
of the latter. He goes still further. If, for instance, he feels a particular
antipathy for something, he will combat it and endeavor to establish a
conscious relation between himself and the <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> in question. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
the unconscious elements that intrude into his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> will become fewer and
fewer. Only by such severe self-discipline can the ten-petalled lotus flower
attain its proper form. The student's inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> must become a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
attention, and he must learn really to hold at a distance everything to
which he should not or does not wish to direct his attention.
If this strict self-discipline be accompanied by meditation as prescribed in
esoteric training, the lotus flower in the region of the pit of the stomach
comes to maturity in the right way, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> and color of a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
are now added to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and warmth perceptible to the organs described
above. The talents and faculties of other <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> are thereby revealed, also
the forces and the hidden attributes of nature. The colored aura of living
creatures then becomes visible; all that is around us manifests its <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
attributes. It must be understood that the very greatest care is necessary at
this stage of development, for the play of unconscious memories is here
exceedingly active. If this were not the case, many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> possess
this inner sense, for it comes almost immediately into evidence when the
impressions delivered by the outer senses are held so completely under
control that they become dependent on nothing save attention or
inattention. This inner <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> remains ineffective as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the powerful
outer <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> smother and benumb it.
Still greater difficulty attends the development of the six-petalled lotus
flower situated in the center of the body, for it can only be achieved as the
result of complete mastery and control of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> personality through

the thoughts and ideas of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> must be tuned to perfect unison. The

must no longer require to curb his passions, in as much as they of their
own accord follow the good. So <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as self-chastisement is necessary, no
one can <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> a certain stage of esoteric development; for a virtue practiced
under constraint if futile. If there is any lust remaining, it interferes with
esoteric development, however <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> the effort made not to humor it. Nor
does it matter <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> this <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> proceeds from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> or the body. For
example, if a certain stimulant be avoided for the purpose of selfpurification, this deprivation will only prove helpful if the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> suffers no
harm from it. Should the contrary to be the case, this proves that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
craves the stimulant, and that abstinence from it is of no value. In this <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span>
it may actually be a question of renouncing the ideal to be attained, until
more favorable <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> conditions, perhaps in another life, shall be
forthcoming. A <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> renunciation may be a far greater achievement than
the struggle for something which, under given conditions, remains
unattainable. Indeed, a renunciation of this <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> contributes more toward
development than the opposite course.
The six-petalled lotus flower, when developed, permits intercourse with
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> only when their existence is manifested in
the astral or soul-world. The development of this lotus flower, however, is
not advisable unless the student has made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> progress on that path of
esoteric development which enables him to raise his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> into a still
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. This entry into the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> proper must always run
parallel with the development of the lotus flowers, otherwise the student
will fall into error and confusion. He <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> undoubtedly be able to see,
but he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> remain incapable of forming a correct estimate of what he
saw. Now, the development of the six-petalled lotus flower itself provides
a certain security against confusion and instability, for no one can be
easily confused who has attained perfect equilibrium between <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> (or
body), passion (or soul), and <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> (or spirit). And yet, something more
than this security is required when, through the development of the sixpetalled lotus flower, living <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of independent existence are revealed
to his spirit, <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> belonging to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> so completely different from the

alone does not assure sufficient security in these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds; still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
organs are necessary. The latter will now be described before the
remaining lotus flowers and the further organization of the soul-body are
discussed. (This expression — soul-body — although obviously
contradictory when <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> literally, is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> because to clairvoyant
perception the impression received spiritually corresponds to the
impression received physically when the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is perceived.)
The development of the soul-body in the manner described above permits
perception in a supersensible world, but anyone wishing to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in

mere mobility of the lotus flowers is not sufficient. The student must
acquire the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of regulating and controlling the movement of his
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs independently and with complete consciousness;
otherwise he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become a plaything for external forces and powers. To
avoid this he must acquire the faculty of hearing what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the inner
world, and this involves the development not only of the soul-body but
also of the etheric body. The latter is that tenuous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> revealed to the
clairvoyant as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of double of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, and forms to a certain
extent an intermediate step between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body.
(See the description on the author's <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> Theosophy.) It is possible for one
equipped with clairvoyant powers consciously to suggest away the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a person. This corresponds on a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane to an
exercise in attentiveness on a lower plane. Just as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> can divert his
attention from something in front of him so that it becomes non-existent
for him, the clairvoyant can extinguish a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> from his field of
observation so that it becomes physically transparent to him. If he exerts
this faculty in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of some <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> standing before him, there remains
visible to his clairvoyant sight only the etheric body, besides the soul-body
which is larger than the other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> — etheric and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> bodies — and
interpenetrates them both. The etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has approximately the size
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, so that it practically fills the same space. It
is an extremely delicate and finely organized structure. (I beg the physicist
not to be disturbed at the expression “etheric body”. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> ether here
is merely <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to suggest the fineness of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> in question, and need
not in any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> be connected with the hypothetical ether of physics.)
Its ground-color is different from any of the seven colors contained in the
rainbow. Anyone capable of observing it will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> a color which is
actually non-existent for <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> perception but to which the color of the
young peach-blossom may be comparable. If desired, the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> can
be examined alone; for this purpose the soul-body must be extinguished
by an effort of attentiveness in the manner described above. Otherwise the
etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> will present an ever changing picture owing to its
interpenetration by the soul-body.
Now, the particles of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> are in continual motion. Countless
currents stream through it in every direction. By these currents, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> itself
is maintained and regulated. Every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> that has life, including animals
and plants, possesses an etheric body. Even in minerals traces of it can be
observed. These currents and movements are, to begin with, independent
of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> will and consciousness, just as the action of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> or stomach
is beyond our jurisdiction, and this independence remains unaltered so
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as we do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> our development in <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of acquiring
supersensible faculties. For, at a certain stage, development consists

74

precisely in adding to the unconscious currents and movements of the
etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> others that are consciously produced and controlled.
When esoteric development has progressed so far that the lotus flowers
begin to stir, much has already been achieved by the student which can
result in the formation of certain quite definite currents and movements in
his etheric body. The <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> of this development is the formation of a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
of center in the region of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> heart, from which radiate currents
and movements in the greatest possible variety of colors and forms. The
center is in reality not a mere point, but a most complicated structure, a
most wonderful organ. It glows and shimmers with every shade of color
and displays forms of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> symmetry, capable of rapid transformation.
Other forms and streams of color radiate from this organ to the other parts
of the body, and beyond it to the astral body, completely penetrating and
illuminating it. The most important of these currents flow to the lotus
flowers. They permeate each petal and regulate its revolutions; then
streaming out at the points of the petals, they lose themselves in outer
space. The <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> the development of a person, the greater the
circumference to which these rays extend.
The twelve-petalled lotus flower has a particularly close connection with
this central organ. The currents flow directly into it and through it,
proceeding on the one side to the sixteen and the two-petalled lotus
flowers, and on the other, the lower side, to the flowers of eight, six and
four petals. It is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that the very greatest care must be devoted
to the development of the twelve-petalled lotus, for an imperfection in the
latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> result in irregular formation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> structure. The above
will give an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the delicate and intimate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of esoteric training,
and of the accuracy needed if the development is to be regular and correct.
It will also be evident beyond doubt that directions for the development of
supersensible faculties can only be the concern of those who have
themselves experienced everything which they propose to awaken in
others, and who are unquestionably in a position to know <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> the
directions they give lead to the exact results desired. If the student follows
the directions that have been given him, he introduces into his etheric
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> currents and movements which are in harmony with the laws and the
evolution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to which he belongs. Consequently these
instructions are reflections of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> laws of cosmic evolution. They
consist of the above-mentioned and similar exercises in meditation and
concentration which, if correctly practiced, produce the results described.
The student must at certain times let these instructions permeate his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
with their content, so that he is inwardly entirely filled with it. A simple
start is made with a <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> to the deepening of the logical activity of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and the producing of an inward intensification of thought. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Thought</span> it
thereby made <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> and independent of all <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> impressions and
experiences; it is concentrated in one point which is held entirely under

75

control. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> a preliminary center is formed for the currents of the etheric
body. This center is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> in the region of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> but in the head, and it
appears to the clairvoyant as the point of departure for movements and
currents. No esoteric training can be successful which does not first create
this center. If the latter were first formed in the region of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> the
aspiring clairvoyant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> doubtless obtain glimpses of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lack all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> insight into the connection between these <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of our senses. This, however, is an unconditional
necessity for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> at the present stage of evolution. The clairvoyant must
not become a visionary; he must retain a firm footing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the earth.
The center in the head, once duly fixed, is then moved lower down, to the
region of the larynx. This is effected by further exercises in concentration.
Then the currents of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> radiate from this point and illumine
the astral space surrounding the individual.
Continued practice enables the student to determine for himself the
position of this etheric body. Hitherto this position depended <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
external forces proceeding from the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. Through further
development the student is able to turn his etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to all sides. This
faculty is effected by currents moving approximately along both <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> and
centered in the two-petalled lotus in the region of the eyes. All this is
made possible through the radiations from the larynx assuming round
forms, of which a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> flow to the two-petalled lotus and thence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
undulating currents along the hands. As a further development, these
currents branch out and ramify in the most delicate manner and become,
as it were, a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of web which then encompasses the entire etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> with a network. Whereas hitherto the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was not
closed to the outer world, so that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> currents from the universal ocean
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> flowed freely in and out, these currents now have to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> through
this membrane. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> becomes sensitive to these external
streams; they become perceptible to him.
And now the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> has come to give the complete system of currents and
movements its center situated in the region of the heart. This again is
effected by persevering with the exercises in concentration and
meditation; and at this point also the stage is reached when the student
becomes gifted with the inner word. All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> now acquire a new
significance for him. They become as it were spiritually audible in their
innermost self, and <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> to him of their essential being. The currents
described above <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> him in touch with the inner being of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to
which he belongs. He begins to mingle his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of his
environment and can let it reverberate in the movements of his lotus
flowers.

At this point the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is entered. If the student has advanced so
far, he acquires a new understanding for all that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> teachers of
humanity have uttered. The sayings of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> and the Gospels, for
instance, produce a new effect on him. They pervade him with a rapture of
which he had not dreamed before. For the tone of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> follows the
movements and rhythms which he has himself formed <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself. He
can now have positive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that a <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> or the Evangelists did not
utter their own revelations but those which flowed into them from the
inmost being of all things. A <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> must here be pointed out which can only
be understood in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of what has been said above. The many
repetitions in the sayings of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> are not comprehensible to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
of our present evolutionary stage. For the esoteric student, however, they
become a force on which he gladly lets his inner senses rest, for they
correspond with certain movements in the etheric body. Devotional
surrender to them, with perfect inner peace, creates an inner harmony with
these movements; and because the latter are an image of certain cosmic
rhythms which also at certain points repeat themselves and revert to
former modes, the student listening to the <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t19 t21 t23 t27 hoverable">Buddha</span> unites
his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> with that of the cosmic mysteries.
In esoteric training there is question of four attributes which must be
acquired on the so-called preparatory path for the attainment of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
knowledge. The first is the faculty of discriminating in thoughts between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and appearance or mere opinion. The <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> attribute is the correct
estimation of what is inwardly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> and real, as against what is merely
apparent. The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> rests in the practice of the six qualities already
mentioned in the preceding pages: thought-control, control of actions,
perseverance, tolerance, <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> and equanimity. The fourth attribute is the
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> of inner freedom.
A mere intellectual understanding of what is included in these attributes is
of no value. They must be so incorporated into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the
basis of inner habits. Consider, for instance, the first of these attributes:
The discrimination between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and appearance. The student must so
train himself that, as a matter of course, he distinguishes in everything that
confronts him between the non-essential elements and those that are
significant and essential. He will only succeed in this if, in his observation
of the outer world, he quietly and patiently ever and again repeats the
attempt. And at the end he will naturally single out the essential and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> at a glance, whereas formerly the non-essential, the transient, too,
could content him. “All that is transient is but a seeming” (“Alles
Vergänglich ist nur ein Gleichnis,” Goethe, Faust II. ) is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> which
becomes an unquestionable conviction of the soul. The same applies to the
remaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the four attributes mentioned.

Now these four inner habits do actually produce a transformation of the
delicate <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> etheric body. By the first, discrimination between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and
appearance, the center in the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> already described is formed and the
center in the region of the larynx prepared. The actual development of
these centers is of course dependent on the exercises in concentration
described above; the latter make for development and the four attributes
<span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> to fruition. Once the center in the larynx has been prepared, the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span>
control of the etheric <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and its enclosure <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> a network covering, as
explained above, results from the correct estimation of what is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> as
against what is apparent and non-essential. If the student acquires this
faculty of estimation, the facts of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds will gradually become
perceptible to him. But he must not think that he has to perform only such
actions which appear significant when judged by the standard of a mere
intellectual estimate. The most trifling action, every little <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span>
accomplished, has something of importance in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cosmic
household, and it is merely a question of being aware of this importance.
A correct estimation of the affairs of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is required, not an
underestimation of them. The six virtues of which the <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> attribute
consists have already been dealt with; they are connected with the
development of the twelve-petalled lotus in the region of the heart, and, as
already indicated, it is to this center that the life-currents of the etheric
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> must be directed. The fourth attribute, the longing for liberation,
serves to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> to fruition the etheric organ in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> region. Once this
attribute becomes an inner habit, the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> frees himself from
everything which depends only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the faculties of his own personal
nature. He ceases to <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> from his own separate standpoint, and the
boundaries of his own narrow self fettering him to this point of <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span>
disappear. The secrets of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> gain access to his inner self.
This is liberation. For those fetters constrain the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> to regard tings
and <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in a manner corresponding to his own personal traits. It is from
this personal manner of regarding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that the student must become
liberated and free.
It will be clear from the above that the instructions given in esoteric
training exert a determining influence reaching the innermost depths of
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature. Such are the instructions regarding the four qualities
mentioned above. They can be found in one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> or another in all the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cosmogonies that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. The founders
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cosmogonies did not give mankind these teachings from some

time, in the course of his training, he must receive that enlightenment
which enables him to adapt himself to this new existence. The sixteenpetalled lotus, for instance, enables him to perceive <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> figures of a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. He must learn now how different these figures can be when
caused by different objects or beings. In the first place, he must notice that
his own thoughts and feelings exert a powerful influence on certain of
these figures, on others little or no influence. One <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of figure alters
immediately if the observer, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> seeing it, says to himself: “that is
beautiful,” and then in the course of his observation changes this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
to: “that is useful.” It is characteristic of the forms proceeding from
minerals or from artificial objects that they change under the influence of
every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and every feeling directed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> them by the observer. This
applies in a lesser degree to the forms belonging to plants, and still less to
those corresponding to animals. These figures, too, are <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and
motion, but this motion is only partially due to the influence of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

species of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> which remains almost entirely unaffected by <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
influence. The student can convince himself that these forms proceed
neither from minerals nor from artificial objects, nor, again, from plants or
animals. To gain complete understanding, he must study those forms
which he can realize to have proceeded from the feelings, instincts, and
passions of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> beings. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> he can <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that these forms too are
influenced by his own thoughts and feelings, if only to a relatively small
extent. But there always remains a residuum of forms in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
which such influences are negligible. Indeed, at the outset of this career
the student can perceive little beyond this residuum. He can only discover
its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> by observing himself. He then learns what forms he himself
produces, for his will, his wishes, and so on, are expressed in these forms.
An instinct that dwells in him, a <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> that fills him, an intention that he

harbors, and so forth, are all manifested in these forms: his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
character displays itself in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of forms. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> by his conscious
thoughts and feelings a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> can exercise an influence on all forms
which do not proceed from himself; but over those which he brings about
in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world, once he has created them. Now, it follows from what
has been said that on this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plan man's inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of instincts, desires,
ideas displays itself outwardly in definite forms, just like all the other
<span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and objects. To <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> appears as part
of the outer world. In a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> man's inner being confronts him as a
reflected image, just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he were surrounded

At this stage of development the student has reached the point where he
can <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> himself from the illusion resulting from the initiation of his
personal self. He can now observe that inner self as outer world, just as he
hitherto regarded as outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> everything that affected his senses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
he learns by gradual experience to deal with himself as hitherto he dealt
with the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> around him.
Were the student to obtain an insight into these <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> worlds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span>

This inner perception must then be translated in the right way. The
qualities of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> appear likewise as in a mirror. A wish directed toward
an outer <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> appears as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> moving toward the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> wishing.

forms or similar shapes that hurl themselves against the individual. In
reality, these passions are headed outward; they seek satisfaction in the
outer world, but this striving outward appears in the mirrored reflection as
an attack on the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> from whom they proceed.
If the student, before attaining insight into <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, has learned by
quiet and sincere self-observation to realized the qualities and the defects
of his own character, he will then, at the moment when his own inner self

recognize themselves in their own mirrored image and will mistake it for
an alien reality. Or they may become alarmed at the vision and, because
they cannot endure the sight, deceive themselves into believing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span>

It is absolutely necessary that the student should experience this <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
aspect of his own inner self before progressing to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> spheres; for his

judge. If he has thoroughly realized the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of his own personality in
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, and if the image of his personality first appears to him
in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world, he is then able to compare the one with the other. He
can refer the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> to something already known to him, so that his point
of departure is on firm ground. Whereas, no matter how many other

entrance into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds is at the end of a path leading through a

to refrain from desiring reality of a more robust <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> at this initial stage,
and to regard these pictures as timely. He will soon meet something quite

of his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self. Out of the picture of his lower personality the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> ego becomes visible. Then threads are spun from the latter to

This is the moment when the two-petalled lotus in the region of the <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> is
required. If it now begins to stir, the student finds it possible to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> his

It is at this stage of development especially that the value of sound
judgment and a training in clear and logical <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> come to the fore. The
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self, which hitherto slumbered unconsciously in an embryonic
state, is now <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> into conscious existence. This is not a figurative but a
positive birth in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, and the being now born, the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
self, must enter that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with all the necessary organs and aptitudes if it
is to be capable of life. Just as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> must provide for a child being <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span>

and morality of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. The <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> self matures in the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> self as a child in the mother's womb. The child's health depends

common <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> and <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that govern <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life. No one can give
birth to a soundly constituted <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and feeling,

has access, after its birth, through its organs of sense, so, too, the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> resemble a child <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> with <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> and ears but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a brain. The
entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of sound and color <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> display itself before him, but he
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be helpless in it.
At this stage of his esoteric development the student realizes, through
personal inward experience, all that had previously appealed to his <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span>
of truth, to his intellect and reason. He has now direct <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of his

82

higher self. He learns how his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self is connected with exalted
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and forms with them a united whole. He sees how the
lower self originates in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world, and it is revealed to him how his
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> outlasts his lower. He can now distinguish the imperishable
in himself from the perishable; that is, he learns through personal insight
to understand the doctrine of the incarnation of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self in the
lower. It will become plain to him that he is part of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
complex and that his qualities and destiny are due to this connection. He
learns to recognize the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of his life, his karma. He realizes that his lower
self, constituting his present existence, is only one of the forms which his
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> being can adopt. He discerns the possibility of working down from
his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self in his lower self, so that he may perfect himself ever more
and more. Now, too, he can comprehend the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> differences between
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> in regard to their level of perfection. He becomes aware that
there are others above him who have already traversed the stages which
still lie before him, and he realizes that the teachings and deeds of such
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> proceed from the inspiration of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. He owes this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> to his first personal glimpse into this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. The socalled initiates of humanity now become vested with reality for him.
These, then, are the gifts which the student owes to his development at this
stage: insight into his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self; insight into the doctrine of the
incarnation of this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> being in a lower; insight into the laws by which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is regulated according to its <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
connections, that is, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of karma; and finally, insight into the
existence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> initiates.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is said of a student who has reached this stage, that all doubt has
vanished from him. His former faith, based on <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> and sound thoughts,
is now replaced by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> and insight which nothing can undermine.
The various religions have presented, in their ceremonies, sacraments, and
rites, externally visible patterns of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> and events.
None but those who have not penetrated to the depths of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
religions can fail to recognize this fact. Personal insight into <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
reality explains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> significance of these externally visible cults.
Religious service, then, becomes for the seer an image of his own
communion with the higher, <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world.
It has been shown how the student, by attaining this stage, becomes in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> a new being. He can now mature to still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> faculties and, by
means of the life-currents of his etheric body, control the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and actual
life-element, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attaining a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> degree of independence from the
restrictions of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body.

VII
The Transformation of Dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span>
An intimation that the student has reached or will soon reach the stage of
development described in the preceding <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> will be found in the
change which comes over his dream life. His dreams, hitherto confused
and haphazard, now begin to assume a more regular character. Their
pictures begin to succeed each other in sensible connection, like the
thoughts and ideas of daily life. He can discern in them law, cause, and
effect. The content, too, of his dreams is changed. While hitherto he
discerned only reminiscences of daily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and transformed impressions of
his surroundings or of his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> condition, there now appear before him
pictures of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> he has hitherto not known. At first the general
character of his dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> remains unchanged, in as far as dreams are
distinguished from waking mental activity by the symbolical presentation
of what they wish to express. No attentive observer of dream <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> can fail
to detect this characteristic. For instance, a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> may dream that he has
caught some horrible creature, and he feels an unpleasant sensation in his
hand. He wakes to discover that he is tightly grasping a corner of the
blanket. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is not presented to the mind, except through the medium
of a symbolical image. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may dream that he is flying from some
pursuer and is stricken with fear. On waking, he finds that he has been
suffering, during sleep, from palpitations of the heart. Disquieting dreams
can also be traced to indigestible food. Occurrences in the immediate
vicinity may also reflect themselves symbolically in dreams. The striking
of a clock may evoke the picture of a troop of soldiers marching by to the
beat of drums. A falling chair may be the occasion of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> dream
drama in which the sound of the fall is reproduced as the report of a gun,
and so forth. The more regulated dreams of esoteric students <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> etheric
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> has begun its development retain this symbolical method of
expression, but they will cease merely to reflect reality connected with the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> environment. As the dreams due to the latter
causes become more connected, they are mingled with similar pictures
expressing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and events of another world. These are the first
experiences lying beyond the range of waking consciousness.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mystic will ever make his experiences in dreams the basis of
any authoritative <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. Such dreams must be
merely considered as providing the first hint of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> development.
Very soon and as a further result, the student's dreams will no longer
remain beyond the reach of intellectual guidance as heretofore, but on the
contrary, will be mentally controlled and supervised like the impressions
and conceptions of waking consciousness. The difference between dream
and waking <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> grows ever smaller. The dreamer remains

84

awake in the fullest <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> during his dream life; that is, he is
aware of his mastery and control over his own vivid mental activity.
During our dreams we are actually in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> other than that of our senses;
but with undeveloped <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs we can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> none other than the
confused conceptions of it described above. It is only in so far present for
us as, for instance, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> could be for a being equipped with
no more than rudimentary eyes. That is why we can see nothing in this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> but counterfeits and reflections of daily life. The latter are
perceptible to us because our own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> paints its daily experiences in
pictorial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> into the substance of which that other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> consists. It
must be clearly understood that in addition to our ordinary conscious
work-a-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we lead a second, unconscious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in that other world. We
engrave in it all our thoughts and perceptions. These tracings only become
visible when the lotus flowers are developed. Now, in every <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being
there are slender rudiments of these lotus flowers. We cannot perceive by
means of them during waking <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> because the impressions
made on them are very faint. We cannot see the stars during the daytime
for a similar reason: their visibility is extinguished by the mighty glare of
the sun. Thus, too, the faint <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> impressions cannot make themselves
felt in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of the powerful impressions received through the senses.
Now, when the gate of the senses is closed during sleep, these other
impressions begin to emerge confusedly, and the dreamer becomes aware
of experiences in another world. But as already explained, these
experiences consist at first merely of pictures engraved in the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> by our mental activity attached to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> senses. Only
developed lotus flowers make it possible for manifestations not derived
from the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> to be imprinted in the same way. And then the
etheric body, when developed, brings <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> concerning these
engraved impressions derived from other worlds.
This is the beginning of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and activity in a new world, and at this point
esoteric training must <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> the student a twofold task. To begin with, he
must learn to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> stock of everything he observes in his dreams, exactly
as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he were awake. Then, if successful in this, he is led to make the
same observations during ordinary waking consciousness. He will so train
his attention and receptivity for these <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> impressions that they need
no longer vanish in the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> impressions, but will always
be at <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> for him and reach him in addition to the others.
When the student has acquired this faculty there arises before his <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span>
<span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> something of the picture described in the preceding chapter, and he
can henceforth discern all that the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> contains as the cause of
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. Above all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> he can perceive and gain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
of his own <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self in this world. The next task now confronting him is

85

to grow, as it were, into this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self, that is, really to regard it as his
own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> self and to act accordingly. He realizes ever more clearly and
intensely that his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and what he hitherto <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> his “I” are
merely the instruments of his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> self. He adopts an attitude toward his
lower self such as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> limited to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the senses adopts
toward some instrument or vehicle that serves him. No one includes as
part of himself the vehicle in which he is traveling, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> he says:
“I travel”; so, too, when an inwardly developed <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> says: “I go through
the door,” his actual conception is: “I carry my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> through the door.”
Only this must become a natural concept for him, so that he never for a
moment loses his firm footing in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, or feels estranged
from it. If the student is to avoid becoming a fantastic visionary he must
not impoverish his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> through his <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> consciousness, but on the
contrary, enrich it, as a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> enriches his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by using the railway and
not merely his legs to cover a certain distance.
When the student has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> raised himself to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> ego, or
rather during his acquisition of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> consciousness, he will learn how
to stir to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> perceptive force in the organ of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> and
control it through the currents described in the foregoing chapter. This
perceptive force is an element of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> sustainability, which proceeds
from the organ in question and flows with beautiful radiance through the
moving lotus flowers and the other channels of the developed etheric
body. Thence it radiates outward into the surrounding <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

How this perceptive force in the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">heart</span> organ is created can only be
gradually understood in the course of actual development.
It is only when this organ of perception can be sent through the etheric

perceived. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it will be seen that complete <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> in

not dwell within, but outside the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body, as already shown. The

no home at first. Should he, however, remain a mere wanderer he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

in <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> space are defined from a fixed point of departure, this, too,
must be the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> in the other world. He must seek out some place,
thoroughly investigate it, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> possession of it.

Natives of Berlin and Paris will involuntarily describe London in a

feelings, desires, and passions. For powers related to all these <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
characteristics are associated with all <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> objects. A crystal, for
instance, is cast in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> by powers which, seen from a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
standpoint, appear as an active <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulse. Similar forces drive the
sap through the capillaries of the plant, cause the blossoms to unfold and
the seed vessels to burst. To developed <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> organs of perception all
these forces appear gifted with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and color, just as the objects of the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and color for <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> eyes. At this stage in his
development the student sees not only the crystal and the plant, but also
the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> forces mentioned above. Animal and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulses are
perceptible to him not only through their <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> manifestation in the
individual, but directly as objects; he perceives them just as he perceives
tables and chairs in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range of instincts,
impulses, desires and passions, both of an animal and of a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being,
constitute the astral cloud or aura in which the being is enveloped.
Furthermore, the clairvoyant can at this stage perceive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which are
almost or entirely withheld from the senses. He can, for instance, tell the

87

astral difference between a room <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of low or of high-minded people.
Not only the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> but also the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> atmosphere of a hospital differs
from that of a ballroom. A commercial town has a different astral air from
that of a university town. In the initial stages of clairvoyance this
perceptive faculty is but slightly developed; its relation to the objects in
question is similar to the relation of dream <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> to waking
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> in ordinary life; it will, however, become fully awakened at
this stage as well.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> achievement of a clairvoyant who has attained the degree of
vision described above is that in which the astral counter-effects of animal
and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> impulses and passions are revealed to him. A loving action is
accompanied by quite a different astral concomitant from one inspired by
hate. Senseless <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> gives rise to an ugly astral counterpart, while a
feeling evoked by a <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> ideal creates one that is beautiful. These astral
images are but faintly perceptible during <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> life, for their strength is
diminished by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. The <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for an object, for
example, produces a counterpart of this sort in addition to the semblance
of the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> itself in the astral world. If, however, the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> be attained
and the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> satisfied, or if, at any rate, the possibility of satisfaction is
forthcoming, the corresponding image will show but faintly. It only attains
its <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> force after the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>
in accordance with her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> still harbors such desires, but can no longer
satisfy them, because the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> and the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> organ are both lacking.
The gourmand, for instance, will still retain, after death, the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to
please his palate; but there is no possibility of satisfying this <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span>
because he no longer has a palate. As a result, the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> produces an
especially powerful counterpart, by which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is tormented. These
experiences evoked by the counterparts of the lower soul-nature after
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the experiences in the soul-world, especially in the region
of desires. They only vanish when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> has purified herself from all
desires inclining toward the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. Then only does the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span>

Even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> these
images are faint during <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world, they are none the less

described above. He cannot attain <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> experience at this stage

namely, waking, dreaming sleep, and dreamless sleep. The attainment of
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> worlds can be readily understood if a
conception be formed of the changes occurring in these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> conditions,
as experienced by one seeking such <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge. When no training
has been undertaken to attain this knowledge, <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> is
continually interrupted by the restful interval of sleep. During these
intervals the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> knows nothing of the outer world, and equally little of
itself. Only at certain periods dreams emerge from the deep ocean of
insensibility, dreams linked to the occurrences of the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> or the
conditions of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. At first, dreams are only regarded as a
particular manifestation of sleep-life, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> states are
generally spoken of, namely, sleeping and waking. For <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science,
however, dreams have an independent significance apart from the other

riddles lie concealed everywhere in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. In the latter, the
effects are seen of certain <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> facts, but no one can penetrate to the

are partly revealed to the student in the condition described above and
developed out of dream life, a condition, however, in which he by no
means remains stationary. True, he must not regard these revelations as

develops this faculty of carrying over into waking <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> the
condition he created for himself out of dream life. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> something new is

Now this condition is only transitional to still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> stages of knowledge.
If the student continues his esoteric exercises he will find, in due time, that
the radical change, as described above, does not confine itself to his dream
life, but that this transformation also extends to what was previously a
condition of deep dreamless sleep. Isolated conscious experiences begin to
interrupt the complete insensibility of this deep sleep. Perceptions
previously unknown to him emerge from the pervading unknown to him
emerge from the pervading darkness of sleep. It is, of course, not easy to
describe these perceptions, for our language is only adapted to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
world, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> only approximate terms can be found to express what
does not at all belong to that world. Still, such terms must be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to
describe the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, and this is only possible by the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
simile; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> seeing that everything in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is interrelated, the attempt

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
of ordinary language are only partially adopted in the course of esoteric
training; for the rest, the student learns another symbolical language, as a
natural outcome of his ascent to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this
language is acquired during esoteric training itself, but that does not
preclude the possibility of learning something concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds even fro such ordinary descriptions as those here given.
Some <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> can be given of those experiences which emerge from the
insensibility of deep sleep if they be compared to a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of hearing. We
may <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of perceptible tones and words. While the experiences during
dreaming sleep may fitly be designated as a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of vision, the facts
observed during deep sleep may be compared to auricular impressions. (It
should be remarked in passing that for the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, too, the faculty
of sight remains the higher. There, too, colors are <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than sounds and
words. The student's first perceptions in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> extend to the
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> colors, but only to the lower tones. Only because man, according to
his general development, is already more qualified for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> revealing
itself in dreaming sleep does he at once perceive colors there. He is less
qualified for the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> unveiling itself in deep sleep; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the
first revelations of it he receives are in tones and words; later on, he can
here, too, ascend to colors and forms.)
Now, when these experiences during deep sleep first come to the notice of
the student, his next task must be to <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> them as clearly and vividly as

90

possible. At first this presents <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> difficulty, the perception of these
experiences being exceedingly slight. The student knows very well, on
waking, that he has had an experience, but is completely in the dark as
regards its nature. The most important <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> during this initial stage is to
remain quiet and composed, and not for a moment lapse into any unrest or
impatience. The latter is under all circumstances detrimental; it can never
accelerate development, but only delays it. The student must cultivate a
quiet and yielding receptivity for the gift that is presented to him; all
violence must be repressed. Should he at any period not become aware of
experiences during sleep he must wait patiently until this is possible. Some
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> this moment will assuredly arrive. And this perceptive faculty, if
awaited with patience and composure, remains a secure possession; while
should it appear momentarily in answer to forcible methods, it may be
completely lost for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> time.
Once this perceptive faculty is acquired and the experiences during sleep
are present to the student's <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> in complete lucidity and clarity,
his attention should be directed to the following point. All these
experiences are seen to consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> kinds, which can be clearly
distinguished. The first <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> will be totally different from anything that he
has ever experienced. These experiences may be a source of joy and
edification, but otherwise they should be <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> to themselves for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
being. They are the first harbinger of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> worlds in which the
student will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> later on. In the other <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of experiences the
attentive observer will discover a certain relationship with the ordinary
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in which he lives. The subjects of his reflections during life, what he

with the ordinary intellect, these are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> concerning which the
experiences during sleep give him information. During every-day <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span>
reflects on his environment; his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> tries to conceive and understand the
connection existing between things; he seeks to grasp in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
what his senses perceive. It is to these ideas and concepts that the
experiences during sleep refer. Obscure, shadowy concepts become
sonorous and living in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> comparable only to the tones and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world. It seems to the student ever more and more as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> the solution of the riddles over which he ponders is whispered to
him in tones and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> out of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. And he is able to connect
with ordinary <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> whatever comes to him from a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> world. What was
formerly only accessible to his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> now becomes actual experience,
just as living and substantial as an experience in this <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> can
be.

what they appear to be for <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> perception. They are the expression
and effluence of a <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world. This <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> world, hitherto concealed
from the student, now resounds for him out of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> environment.

It is easy to see that this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> perceptive faculty can prove a blessing
only if the opened soul-senses are in perfect order, just as the ordinary
senses can only be <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> observation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> if their

include concentration, in which the attention is directed to certain definite
ideas and concepts connected with the secrets of the universe; and
meditation, which is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in such ideas, a complete submersion in them,
in the right way.

mother. When the isolated experiences during sleep begin, as described,
the moment of birth is approaching for the liberated soul; for she has
literally become a new being, developed by the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> himself,

That this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> soul-being should be <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> during deep sleep will be easily
grasped, for if that delicate organism lacking all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of resistance

of no <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> against that of the body. During sleep, however, when the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rests in as far as its activity is dependent on <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> perception, the
activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> soul, at first so delicate and inconspicuous, can come
into evidence. Here again the student must bear in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> that these

waking <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> as well. The acquisition of this faculty will enable
him to perceive the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in its own character, among and <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>

Now, the student must realize at this stage of development that he is
dealing with separate and more or less isolated <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> experiences. He

The right <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> to do is to strive for an ever clearer conception of the

into which he has now found his way, and through continued application
to his prescribed exercises, the student experiences an ever increasing
extension and expansion of <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> during sleep. The unconscious
intervals during sleep-life grow ever smaller, while more and more
experiences emerge from erstwhile unconsciousness. These experiences

attainment of that condition, on his path to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, in which the
unconsciousness of sleep-life is transformed into complete consciousness.
When his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rests, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> lives in surroundings which are just as real as
those of his waking daily life. It is needless to say that the reality during
sleep is different from <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> reality surrounding the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. The
student learns — indeed he must learn if he is to retain a firm footing in
the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and not become a visionary — to connect the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
experiences of sleep with his <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> environment. At first, however, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> entered during sleep is a completely new revelation. This important
stage of development, at which <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> is retained in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> during
sleep, is known in <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science as the continuity of consciousness. The
condition here indicated is regarded, at a certain stage of development, as
a <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of ideal, attainable at the end of a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> path. What the student first
learns is the extension of <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> soul-states, in the first of

only unconscious dreamless sleep. Anyone having reached this stage of
development does not cease experiencing and learning during those
intervals when the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> rests, and when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> receives no

medium for <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> perceptions and thought. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is then only

which are beyond the scope of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> observation. But the activity

which to observe what is going on around us and see what we ourselves
are doing during sleep, as we observe our daily <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> environment with
our ordinary senses. The preceding chapters have shown that esoteric
training consists in the development of such <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> organs. Now
if, as a result of esoteric training, the student's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> during sleep is
transformed in the manner described in the foregoing chapter, he will,
when in that condition, be able to follow consciously everything going on
around him. He can at will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in his environment as he could,
when awake, with his ordinary senses. It should here be noted that a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of clairvoyance is required for the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> perception of
ordinary <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> environment. This was indicated in the last chapter. In
the initial stages of his development the student perceives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>

These characteristics of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> during sleep or in dreams illustrate what is

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> lives in
uninterrupted activity in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, even gathering from them the
impulse to act <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. Ordinarily unconscious of his
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> life, the esoteric student renders himself conscious of it, and
thereby his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> becomes transformed.

just as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> blind is changed, through a successful

<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> changed through esoteric training. He outgrows the principle of
being guided by a <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> and must henceforward undertake to be his own
guide. The moment this occurs he is, of course, liable to commit errors

totally unknown to ordinary consciousness. He acts now from a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
from which, formerly, <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers unknown to him influenced him.
These <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers are directed by the universal cosmic harmony. The
student withdraws from this cosmic harmony, and must now himself
accomplish <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> which were hitherto done for him <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his cooperation.
It is for this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that so much is found in books dealing with these
matters concerning the dangers connected with the ascent into <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds. The descriptions sometimes given of these dangers may <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> make
timid souls shudder at the prospect of this <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> life. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> is that
dangers only arise when the necessary precautions are neglected. If all the
measures counseled by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> esoteric science are adopted, the ascent will
indeed ensue through experiences surpassing in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and magnitude

there can be no question of injury to health or life. The student meets with
horrible powers threatening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> at every turn and from every side. It will
even be possible for him to make <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of certain forces and <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> existing
beyond <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> perception, and the temptation is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> to control these
forces for the furtherance of personal and forbidden interests, or to employ
them wrongly out of a deficient <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. Some of
these especially important experiences, for instance, the meeting with
Guardian of the Threshold, will be described in the following chapters.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> we must realize that the hostile powers are none the less present, even

It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that in this <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> their relation to

But at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> his own existence is enhanced and the circle of his

A real danger can
only arise if the student, through impatience or arrogance, assumes too
early a certain independence with regard to the experiences of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds; if he cannot wait to gain really sufficient insight into the
supersensible laws. In these spheres, modesty and humility are far less
empty <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> than in ordinary life. If the student possesses these qualities
in the very best <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> he may be certain that his ascent into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>

life. Above all things, no disharmony must ensue between the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
experiences and the events and demands of every-day life. Man's task
must be entirely sought for on this earth, and anyone desiring to shirk his
earthly task and to escape into another <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> may be certain he will never

he is a participator in those worlds in which the creative forces lie
concealed — only for these reasons should he have the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to ascend to
the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds. No one approaching esoteric training with these
sentiments, and resolved not to deviate for a moment from these
prescribed directions, need <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">fear</span> the slightest danger. No one should allow
the prospect of these dangers to deter him from esoteric training; it should
rather act as a strong challenge to one and all to acquire those faculties
which every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> esoteric student must possess.
After these preliminary observations that should dispel any element of
terror, a description of some of the so-called dangers will be given. It is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> changes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the student's finer bodies, as described
above. These changes are connected with certain processes in the
development of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fundamental forces of the soul, with willing,
feeling, and thinking. Before esoteric training, these forces are subject to a
connection ordained by <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> cosmic laws. Man's willing, feeling and
thinking are not arbitrary. A particular <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> arising in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> is attended
by a particular feeling, according to natural laws; or it is followed by a
resolution of the will in equally natural sequence. We enter a room, <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> it
stuffy, and open the window. We hear our name <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> and follow the call.
We are questioned and we answer. We perceive an ill-smelling <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> and
experience a feeling of disgust. These are simple connections between
thinking, feeling, and willing. When we survey <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that
everything is built up on such connections. Indeed, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is not termed
normal unless such a connection, founded on the laws of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, is
observed between thinking, feeling and willing. It <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be found
contrary to these laws if the sight of an ill-smelling <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> gave anyone
pleasure, or if anyone, on being questioned, did not answer. The success
anticipated from a right education or fitting instruction is based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
presumption that a connection between thinking, feeling, and willing,
corresponding to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> nature, can be established in the pupil. Certain
ideas are conveyed to him on the assumption that they will be associated,
in regular fashion, with his feelings and volitions.
All this arises from the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that in the finer soul-vehicles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> the

connected with each other according to laws. This connection in the finer

latter, too, the organs of will are connected according to laws with those of
thinking and feeling. A particular thought, therefore, inevitably evokes a
feeling or an activity of will. In the course of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> development, the
threads interconnecting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fundamental forces are severed. At first
this severance occurs only <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the finer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> organism, but at a still
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> stage the separation extends also to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. It is a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
that in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> development the brain divides into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> separate

parts. This separation is not physically perceptible in the ordinary way, nor
can it be demonstrated by the keenest instruments. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it occurs, and the
clairvoyant has means of observing it. The brain of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> clairvoyant
divides into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> independently active entities: The thought-brain, the
feeling-brain, and the will-brain.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the organs of thinking, feeling, and willing become individualized;
their connection henceforth is not maintained by laws inherent in
themselves, but must be managed by the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of the individual. This, then, is the change which the student observes
coming over him: that no connection arises of itself between an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> and a
feeling or a will-impulse, unless he himself provides one. No impulse
urges him from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to action unless he himself in freedom give rise to
this impulse. He can henceforth confront, devoid of feeling, a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> which
before his training <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have filled him with glowing <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> or bitter
hatred; and he can remain impassive at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> which formerly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
have spurred him on to action, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> of its own accord. He can
perform actions through resolutions of the will for which there is not the
slightest <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> for anyone not having undergone esoteric training. The
student's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> achievement is the attainment of complete mastery over the
combined activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> forces; but at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the
responsibility for this activity is placed entirely in his own hands.
It is only through this transformation of his being that the student can enter
consciously into relation with certain supersensible forces and beings, for
his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> forces are related to certain fundamental forces of the world.
The force, for instance, inherent in the will can affect definite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> and
the <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds, and also perceive them; but it can only do
so when liberated from its connection with thinking and feeling <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the
soul. The moment this connection is severed, the activity of the will can be
exteriorized. The same applies to the forces of thinking and feeling. A
feeling of hatred sent out by a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is visible to the clairvoyant as a fine
luminous cloud of special coloring; and the clairvoyant can ward off this
feeling of hatred, just as an ordinary <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> wards off a <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> blow that
is aimed at him. In the supersensible world, hatred becomes a visible
phenomenon, but the clairvoyant can only perceive it in so far as he is able
to project outwards the force lying in his feeling, just as the ordinary
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> directs outwards the receptive faculty of his eye. And what is said
of hatred applies also to far more important phenomena of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
world. The student can enter into conscious intercourse with them, thanks
to the liberation of the fundamental forces of his soul.
Through the separation of the forces of thinking, feeling, and willing, the
possibility of a three-fold aberration arises for anyone neglecting the
injunctions given by esoteric science. Such an aberration can occur if the
connecting threads are severed before the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> is

97

sufficiently advanced to hold the reins and guide properly the separated
forces into <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> and harmoniously combined activity. For as a rule, the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> soul-forces are not equally advanced in their development at
any given period of life. In one person, thinking is ahead of feeling and
willing; in a second, another soul-force has the upper <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span> over its
companions. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the connection between the soul-forces is
maintained as established by <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> cosmic laws, no injurious irregularity,
in a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> sense, can occur through the predominance of one force or
another. Predominating will, for instance, is prevented by the leveling
influence of thinking and feeling from lapsing into any particular excesses.
When, however, a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> of such predominating will undertakes esoteric
training, feeling and thinking cease to exert their regular influence on the
will when the latter constantly presses on to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> exertions of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> If,
then, such a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is not sufficiently advanced to control completely the
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> and himself restore harmony, the will pursues its
own unbridled way, continually overpowering its possessor. Feeling and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> lapse into complete impotence; the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> is scourged by his
over-mastering will. A violent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> is the result, rushing from one
unbridled action to another.
A <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> deviation occurs when feeling unduly shakes off its proper
control. A <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> inclined to the revering of others may then diverge into
unlimited dependence, to the extent of losing all personal will and
thoughts. Instead of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> knowledge, the most pitiful vacuity and
feebleness <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become such a person's lot. Or, in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of such
inordinate predominance of the feeling life, a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> with an inclination
toward religious devotion can sink into the most degenerate welter.
The <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> is found when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> predominates, resulting in a
contemplative nature, hostile to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and locked up <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> itself. The world,
for such people, has no further importance save that it provides them with
objects for satisfying their boundless thirst for wisdom. No <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> ever
moves them to an action or a feeling. They appear everywhere as cold and
unfeeling creatures. They flee from every contact with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of

These are the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> ways of error into which the student can stray: (1)
exuberant violence of will, (2) sentimental emotionalism, and (3) cold,
loveless striving for wisdom. For outward observation, and also from the
ordinary (materialistic) medical standpoint, anyone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> gone astray is
hardly distinguishable (especially in degree) from an insane or, at least, a
highly neurasthenic person. Of course, the student must not resemble
these. It is essential for him that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> fundamental soul-forces,
thinking, feeling, and willing, should have undergone harmonious
development before being released from their inherent connection and

98

subordinated to the awakened <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> consciousness. For once a mistake is
made and one of the soul-forces falls a prey to unbridled excess, the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>

pervades the individual's entire personality, and for a <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> there can
be no question of the balance being restored. What appears to be a
harmless characteristic as <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as its possessor is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> esoteric training,

acquired the ability to include in his waking <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> the experiences
forthcoming during sleep. As <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as there is only the question of

universal cosmic laws, reacts during the waking hours on the disturbed
equilibrium of the soul, tending to restore the balance. That is why it is so
essential that the waking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the student should be in every respect
regular and healthy. The more capable he is of meeting the demands made
by the outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a healthy, sound constitution of body, soul, and
spirit, the better it is for him. On the other hand, it may be very bad for
him if his ordinary waking <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> affects him in an exciting or irritating way,
that is, if destructive or hampering influences of outer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> affect him in

him into undisturbed, harmonious communion with his surroundings,
while avoiding everything detrimental to this harmony — everything that
brings unrest and feverish haste into his life. And here it is not so much a
question of casting off this unrest and haste in an external sense, but much
more of taking care that thoughts, feelings, intentions, and bodily health

The Guardian of the Threshold
The important experiences marking the student's ascent into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
worlds include his meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold. Strictly
speaking, there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Guardians: a lesser and a greater. The student
meets the lesser Guardian when the threads connecting willing, feeling,
and thinking <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the finer astral and etheric bodies begin to loosen, in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> described in the foregoing chapter. The greater Guardian is
encountered when this sundering of the connections extends to the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> parts of the body, that is, at first to the brain. The lesser Guardian
is a sovereign being. He does not come into existence, as far as the student
is concerned, until the latter has reached the requisite stage of
development. Only some of his most important characteristics can here be
indicated.
The attempt will now be made to describe in narrative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> this meeting
with the lesser Guardian of the Threshold, as a result of which the student
learns that his thinking, feeling, and willing have become released <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
him from their inherent connection.
A truly terrible spectral being confronts him, and he will need all the
presence of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and <span class="t7 t13 t19 t20 t29 hoverable">faith</span> in the security of his path which he has had
ample opportunity to acquire in the course of his previous training.
The Guardian proclaims his signification somewhat in the following
words: “Hitherto, powers invisible to thyself watched over thee. They saw
to it that in the course of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> lives each of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thy</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> its

<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of substances. The developed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the magician is then able
to mould the frankincense into shape, animating it with the still
unredeemed karma of the individual. Such <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> phenomena are no
longer necessary for those sufficiently prepared for the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> sight; and
besides this, anyone who sees, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> adequate preparation, his
unredeemed karma appear before his <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> as a living creature <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> run

What is here indicated in narrative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> must not be understood in the
<span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of an allegory, but as an experience of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> possible reality
befalling the esoteric student.
The Guardian must warn him not to go a step further unless he feels in
himself the strength to fulfill the demands made in the above speech.
However horrible the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> assumed by the Guardian, it is only the effect
of the student's own past life, his own character risen out of him into

102

independent existence. This awakening is <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> about by the separation
of will, thought, and feeling. To feel for the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that one has oneself

significance. The student's preparation must aim at enabling him to endure
the terrible sight <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a trace of timidity and, at the moment of the
meeting, to feel his strength so increased that he can undertake fully
conscious the responsibility for transforming and beautifying the
Guardian.
If successful, this meeting with the Guardian results in the student's next
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> being an entirely different event from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> as he knew
it formerly. He experiences <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> consciously by laying aside the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as one discards a garment that is worn out or perhaps rendered

importance only for those living with him, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> perception is still
restricted to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the senses. For them the student dies; but for
himself nothing of importance is changed in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> environment. The
entire supersensible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> stood open to him before his death, and it is this
same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that now confronts him after death.
The Guardian of the Threshold is also connected with other matters. The
<span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> belongs to a family, a nation, a race; his activity in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> his belonging to some such community. His <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
character is also connected with it. The conscious activity of <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span>
persons by no means exhausts everything to be reckoned with in a family,
a nation, or a race. Besides their character, families, nations, and races
have also their destiny. For persons restricted to their senses these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
remain mere general ideas; and the materialistic thinker, in his prejudice,
will look down with contempt on the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist when he hears that
for him, family and national character, lineal or racial destiny, are vested
in <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> just as real as the personality in which the character and destiny
of the <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> are vested. The <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientist becomes
acquainted with <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds of which the separate personalities are
members, just as arms and legs are members of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. Besides
the separate individuals, a very real family and national group <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and
racial <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is at <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a family, a people, or a race. Indeed, in
a certain <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> the separate individuals are merely the executive organs of
these family group souls, racial spirits, and so on. It is nothing but the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> to say, for instance, that a national group <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> makes <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of each
<span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> belonging to that nation for the execution of some work.
The group <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> does not descend into <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> reality but
dwells in the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> worlds and, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> world,
makes <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> organs of each <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being. In a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> sense, it is like an architect making <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of workmen for executing
the details of a building. In the truest sense, everyone receives his allotted
task from his family, national, or racial group soul. Now, the ordinary

103

person is by no means initiated into the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> design of his work. He
joins unconsciously in the tasks of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and of his race. From the
moment the student meets the Guardian, he must not only know his own
tasks, but must knowingly collaborate in those of his folk, his race. Every
extension of his horizon necessarily enlarges the scope of his duties. What
actually happens is that the student adds a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> to his finer soul-body.
He puts on a <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> garment. Hitherto he found his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> through the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>
with the coverings enveloping his personality; and what he had to
accomplish for his community, his nation, his race, was directed by <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
spirits who made <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of his personality.
And now, a further revelation made to him by the Guardian of the
Threshold is that henceforth these spirits will withdraw their guiding <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
from him. He must step out of the circle of his community. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> as an
isolated personality he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> become hardened in himself and decline into
ruin, did he not, himself, acquire those powers which are vested in the
national and racial spirits. Many, no doubt, will say: “Oh, I have entirely
freed myself from all lineal and racial connections; I only want to be a
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being and nothing but a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being.” To these one must reply:
“Who, then, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> you to this freedom? Was it not your family who
placed you in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> where you now stand? Have you not your lineage,
your nation, your race to thank for being what you are? They have <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span>
you up. And if now, exalted above all prejudices, you are one of the lightbringers and benefactors of your stock and even of your race, it is to their
up-bringing that you owe it. Yes, even when you say you are `nothing but
a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being,' even the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that you have become such a personality you
owe to the spirits of your communities.” Only the esoteric student learns
what it means to be entirely cut off from his family, national, or racial
spirit. He alone realizes, through personal experience, the insignificance of
all such education in respect of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> now confronting him. For
everything inculcated by education completely melts away when the
threads binding will, thought, and feeling are severed. He looks back on
the result of all his previous education as he might on a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> crumbling
away brick by brick, which he must now rebuild in a new form. And
again, it is more than a mere symbolical expression to say that when the
Guardian has enunciated his first statement, there arises from the spot
where he stands a whirlwind which extinguishes all those <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> lights
that have hitherto illumined the pathway of his life. Utter darkness,
relieved only by the rays issuing from the Guardian himself, unfolds
before the student. And out of this darkness resounds the Guardian's
further admonition: “Step not across my Threshold until <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thou</span> dost clearly

followed will now no longer be available to thee.” At these words, the
student must turn and glance backward. The Guardian of the Threshold

104

now draws aside a veil which till now had concealed deep life-mysteries.
The family, national, and racial spirits are revealed to the student in their
<span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> activity, so that he perceives clearly on the one hand, how he has
hitherto been led, and no less clearly on the other hand, that he will

position to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the necessary strength at the right moment. Indeed, the

experience at the Threshold will then be attended by a premonition of that

It has been described in the foregoing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> how significant for the

actions, feelings, and thoughts. These unseen forces have become the
cause of his destiny and his character, and he realizes how he himself
founded the present in the past. He can understand why his inner self, now
standing to a certain extent revealed before him, includes particular
inclinations and habits, and he can also recognize the origin of certain
blows of fate that have befallen him. He perceives why he loves one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span>

gaze. He observes how before his birth he wove the causes which
necessarily led to his return into life. Henceforth he knows that being

and complete this being. Moreover, he recognizes that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> cannot sever

From this standpoint it will also be readily understood why the Threshold

In the above the answer will be found to the question why <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> his

His actions, feelings, and thoughts are at first dominated by the perishing
and the mortal. The latter gave rise to his sense-organs. For this reason,
these organs and all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> activating them are doomed to perish The
imperishable will not be found in the instincts, impulses, and passions, or

extent to which he is entangled in the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> sense-world is exposed to
the student's view. The presence of instincts, impulses, desires, egotistical
wishes and all forms of selfishness, and so forth, expresses itself in this
entanglement, as it does further in his membership in a race, a nation, and
so forth; for peoples and races are but steps leading to pure humanity. A
race or a nation stands so much the higher, the more perfectly its members
express the pure, ideal <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> type, the further they have worked their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>

harmonious perfection. In a similar way, the pilgrimage through ever purer
forms of morality and religion is a perfecting process; for every moral
stage retains the passion for the perishable beside the seeds of an ideal
future.
Now in the Guardian of the Threshold as described above, the product of
the past is manifest, containing only so many seeds of the future as could
be planted in the course of time. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> everything that can be extracted from

deprives himself on the advantage resulting from their assistance. Anyone,
therefore, really following the instructions of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> occultists will,

felicity and a mere existence in the supersensible worlds. In fact, it
becomes their duty to keep the student away from the supersensible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span>

Appendix
The path to supersensible knowledge, as described in this book, leads the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> through experiences concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of which it is especially
important to avoid all illusions and misconceptions. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> it is but natural
that the latter should arise in such questions as are here considered. In this
connection one of the most serious mistakes occurs when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> range
of inner experience dealt with in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science is distorted into
appearing in the same category as superstition, visionary dreaming,
mediumship (spiritism), and other degenerate practices. This distortion is
often due to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that persons desirous of following the path described
in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> are confused with others who in their search for supersensible
reality, and as a result of methods foreign to genuine striving for
knowledge, wander into undesirable paths. The experiences through which
the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> lives on the path here described are wholly confined to the
realm of psycho-spiritual experience. They are only possible if equal
freedom and independence from the bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> are attained for certain
other inner experiences, as is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> during ordinary consciousness,
when thoughts are made concerning <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> outwardly perceived or
inwardly felt and willed, thoughts which do not themselves originate in
what is perceived, felt, and willed. There are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who deny the
existence of such thoughts. They believe that no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is possible that is
not extracted from perceptions or from the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> dependent on the
body. For them, all thoughts are to a certain extent mere reflections of
perceptions and of inner experiences. This view, however, can be
expressed only by those who have never raised themselves to the faculty
of experiencing with their souls a self-sustaining <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> in pure thought. For
others, who have lived through this experience, it is a matter of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>

feeling, willing and so forth. These other functions are effectuated by the
body; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> plays into them, and to the degree that is does this a
process takes place, in and through the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being, in which his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>

detached from the encompassing soul-life, that is, thoughts that are selfsustaining and from which everything provided by perception or bodily

perception, all memory, and every other token of inner life, knows himself

to be in a supersensible region and experiences himself outside the
<span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> body. For anyone familiar with this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> process, the question

from experience. The only question for him is: What prevents such a
positive <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> from being recognized? And the answer he finds to this
question is that the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> does not reveal itself unless the student first
cultivates a condition of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which allows him to become the recipient of
this revelation.
Now, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> become at once suspicious when an activity confined entirely

themselves should reveal itself. They believe that they themselves give the
revelation its content because they prepare themselves to receive it. They
expect experiences to which they contribute nothing and which allow them
to remain quite passive. Should such people, in addition, be ignorant of the
simplest scientific requirements for the comprehension of a given fact,
they will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> for an objective revelation of non-sensible substances

participation is reduced below the level maintained in sense-perception

much as this is the case, the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> being makes himself independent of

the experiences of the visionary and in mediumistic phenomena the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
being becomes completely dependent on his body. He excludes from the

independent of his body. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the content and productions of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> are
merely revelations of his bodily life. The experiences of the visionary and
the phenomena produced by the medium owe their existence to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
that a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> while <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> experiencing and producing is, with his soul, less
independent of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> than in ordinary perception and willing. In the
experience of the supersensible as indicated in this book, the development
of soul-life proceeds in just the opposite direction from that <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> by the

visionary and the medium. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> acquires a progressively greater
independence of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> than is the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> in perceiving and willing. The
same independence realized in the experience of pure <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> is attained
by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> for a far wider range of activity.
For the supersensible activity of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> here meant, it is especially
important to grasp and realize in the clearest possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> this experience

supersensible activity of the soul, but one in which nothing supersensible
is as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> perceived.

continuation of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> already attained by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> when united with pure
thought. For this <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> it is so important to gain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of this union
in the right way, for it is from its comprehension that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> shines forth to

bodily functions, and what is than experienced is not the revelation of a
supersensible world, but bodily revelations confined to the supersensible
world.

(2) Having penetrated to the sphere of the supersensible, the soul's
experiences are of such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> that descriptive expressions cannot so
easily be found for them as for experiences confined to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of the
senses. Care must often be <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> not to overlook the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that to a certain
extent, in descriptions of supersensible experience, the distance separating
the actual <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> from the language <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> to describe it is greater than in
descriptions of <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> experience. The reader must be at pains to realize
that many an expression is intended as an illustration, merely indicating in
a delicate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the reality to which it refers. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is said on page 19 of
this book: “Originally all rules and teachings of <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> science were
expressed in a symbolical sign-language.” And on page 82, a “certain
writing system” was mentioned. Now, anyone may easily be led to
suppose that such a writing system can be learned in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> we
learn the letters of an ordinary <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> language, and their combinations.
In this connection it must be pointed out that there have been and there
still are <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientific signs by means of which supersensible facts are
expressed. And anyone initiated into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of these symbols attains
thereby the means of directing his inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> toward the supersensible
realities in question. But what is of far greater importance for
supersensible experiences is that, in the course of that supersensible
experience to which the realization of the contents of this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> leads, the

114

soul should, in the contemplation of the supersensible, gain the revelation
of such a writing through personal experience. The supersensible says
something to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> must translate into these illustrative
signs, so that it can be surveyed with <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> consciousness. The statement
can be made that what is imparted in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> can be realized by every
soul. And in the course of this realization, which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> can personally
determine according to the indications given, the resulting events occur as
described. Let the reader <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> as a conversation between the
author and himself. The statement that the student needs personal
instruction should be understood in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> that this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> itself is
personal instruction. In earlier times there were reasons for reserving such
personal instruction for oral teaching; today we have reached a stage in
the evolution of humanity in which <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> scientific <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> must
become far more widely disseminated than formerly. It must be placed
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the reach of everyone to a quite different extend from what was the
<span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> in older times. Hence the <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> replaces the former oral instruction. It
is only to a limited extent correct to say that further personal instruction is
necessary beyond that contained in this book. No doubt someone may
need assistance, and it may be of importance for him or her; but it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
be false to believe that there are any cardinal points not mentioned in this
book. These can be found by anyone who reads correctly, and, above all,
completely.

(3) The descriptive instructions given in this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> appear at first sight to

For this reason, when information is given concerning the construction of
supersensible cognitive processes, it appears as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> a transformation of

“some results of initiation,” something which, with a slight alteration, can
apply to other parts of the book. It may occur to someone to ask <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span>
such figurative descriptions are necessary, and <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not be
