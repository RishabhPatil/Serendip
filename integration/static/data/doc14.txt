investigators of the Secret Doctrines this little <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
world-old Hermetic Teachings. There has been so little <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this
subject, not withstanding the countless references to the Teachings in
the many <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> occultism, that the many earnest searchers after the
Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the appearance of this present
volume.

The purpose of this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is not the enunciation of any special
philosophy or doctrine, but rather is to give to the students a
statement of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> that will serve to reconcile the many bits of
occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that they may have acquired, but which are apparently
opposed to each other and which often serve to discourage and disgust
the beginner in the study. Our intent is not to erect a new Temple of
Knowledge, but rather to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span> of the student a Master-Key
with which he may open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery
through the main portals he has already entered.

There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> which
have been so closely guarded as the fragments of the Hermetic Teachings
which have come down to us over the tens of centuries which have elapsed
since the lifetime of its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> founder, Hermes Trismegistus, the
"scribe of the gods," who dwelt in old <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> in the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> when the
present race of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> was in its infancy. Contemporary with Abraham, and,
if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage, Hermes
was, and is, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Central <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Sun</span> of Occultism, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> rays have served
to illumine the countless teachings which have been promulgated since
his time. All the fundamental and basic teachings embedded in the
esoteric teachings of every race may be traced back to Hermes. Even the
most <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the
original Hermetic Teachings.

From the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of the Ganges many advanced occultists wandered to the
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master. From him they obtained
the Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the Secret Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also
came the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> of
Masters, and his influence was so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> that in spite of the many
wanderings from the path on the part of the centuries of teachers in
these different lands, there may still be found a certain basic
resemblance and correspondence which underlies the many and often quite
divergent theories entertained and taught by the occultists of these
different lands today. The student of Comparative Religions will be able
to perceive the influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion
worthy of the name, now known to man, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> it be a dead religion or
one in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> vigor in our own times. There is always certain
correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the Hermetic
Teachings act as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Reconciler.

The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of planting
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Seed-Truth which has grown and blossomed in so many strange
forms, rather than to establish a school of philosophy which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
dominate, the world's thought. But, nevertheless, the original truths
taught by him have been kept intact in their original purity by a few
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> each age, who, refusing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> numbers of half-developed students and
followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> for the
few who were ready to comprehend and <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> it. From lip to ear the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> has been handed down among the few. There have always been a few
Initiates in each generation, in the various lands of the earth, who
kept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have
always been willing to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of
the outside world, when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> grew dim, and clouded by
<span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign
matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the
Truth, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom. These
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> devoted their lives to the labor of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">love</span> which the poet has so <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
stated in his lines:

     "O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age
     in its dark cavern--in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">holy</span> temples cherished. Fed
     by pure ministers of love--let not the flame die out!"

These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers.
They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in
each generation who are ready for the truth, or who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> recognize it
if it were presented to them. They reserve the "strong meat for men,"
while others furnish the "milk for babes." They reserve their pearls of
<span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in
their crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar
swine, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> trample them in the mud and mix them with their
disgusting mental food. But still these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have never forgotten or
overlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> to those ready to receive it, which teaching is
stated in The Kybalion as follows: "Where fall the footsteps of the
Master, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide." And again:
"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to
fill them with wisdom." But their customary attitude has always been
strictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The
Kybalion: "The lips of <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">Wisdom</span> are closed, except to the ears of
Understanding."

There are those who have criticized this attitude of the Hermetists, and
who have claimed that they did not manifest the proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in their
policy of seclusion and reticence. But a moment's glance back over the
pages of history will show the <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of the Masters, who knew the folly
of attempting to teach to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> that which it was neither ready or
willing to receive. The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs, and
have, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their closed
lips, while the "heathen raged noisily about them" in their customary
amusement of putting to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and torture the honest but misguided
enthusiasts who imagined that they could force <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a race of barbarians

along The Path.

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of persecution has not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> died out in the land. There
are certain Hermetic Teachings, which, if publicly promulgated, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

In this little <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> we have endeavored to give you an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the
fundamental teachings of The Kybalion, striving to give you the working
Principles, leaving you to apply therm yourselves, rather than
attempting to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> out the teaching in detail.

not, then you must develop yourself into one, for otherwise the Hermetic

THE HERMETIC PHILOSOPHY

    "The lips of <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> are closed, except to the ears
    of Understanding"--The Kybalion.

From old <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> have come the fundamental esoteric and occult teachings
which have so strongly influenced the philosophies of all races, nations
and peoples, for several <span class="t6 hoverable">thousand</span> years. Egypt, the home of the Pyramids
and the Sphinx, was the birthplace of the Hidden <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">Wisdom</span> and Mystic
Teachings. From her Secret Doctrine all nations have borrowed. India,
Persia, Chaldea, Medea, China, Japan, Assyria, <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Greece and Rome,
and other <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> countries partook liberally at the feast of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
which the Hierophants and Masters of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">Land</span> of Isis so freely provided
for those who came prepared to partake of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> store of Mystic and
Occult Lore which the masterminds of that <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">land</span> had gathered
together.

In <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> dwelt the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Adepts and Masters who have never been
surpassed, and who seldom have been equaled, during the centuries that
have <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span> their processional flight since the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Hermes.
In <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> was located the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. At the
doors of her Temples entered the Neophytes who afterward, as
Hierophants, Adepts, and Masters, traveled to the four corners of the
earth, carrying with them the precious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> which they were ready,
anxious, and willing to <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to those who were ready to receive the
same. All students of the Occult recognize the debt that they owe to
these venerable Masters of that <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> land.

But among these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Masters of <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> there once dwelt one of
whom Masters hailed as "The <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> of Masters." This man, if "man"
indeed he was, dwelt in <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> in the earliest days. He was known as
Hermes Trismegistus. He was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">father</span> of the Occult Wisdom; the founder
of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> story
are lost to history, owing to the lapse of the years, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> several of
the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> countries disputed with each other in their claims to the
honor of having furnished his birthplace--and this thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span>
ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on
this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span>
of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of Moses. The
best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of
the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham acquired a
portion of his mystic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> from Hermes himself.

As the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> rolled by after his passing from this plane of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
(tradition recording that he lived <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> in the flesh),
the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the
name of Thoth. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Years</span> after, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> Greece also made him
one of their many gods--calling him "Hermes, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">god</span> of Wisdom." The
Egyptians revered his memory for many centuries-yes, tens of centuries--
calling him "the Scribe of the Gods," and bestowing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him,
distinctively, his <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> title, "Trismegistus," which means "the
thrice-great"; "the great-great"; "the greatest-great"; etc. In all the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name
being synonymous with the "Fount of Wisdom."

Even to this day, we <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the term "hermetic" in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of "secret";
"sealed so that nothing can escape"; etc., and this by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of the
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the followers of Hermes always observed the principle of
secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in "casting pearls
before swine," but rather held to the teaching "milk for babes"; "meat
for strong men," both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the
Christian scriptures, but both of which had been <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by the Egyptians
for centuries before the Christian era.

And this policy of careful dissemination of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> has always
characterized the Hermetics, even <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> the present day. The Hermetic
Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions, but never
identified with any particular country, nor with any particular
religious sect. This because of the warning of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> teachers
against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a
creed. The <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">wisdom</span> of this caution is apparent to all students of
history. The <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was
largely lost, owing to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that the teachers became priests, and so
mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism
of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious
superstition, cults, creeds and "gods." So it was with <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> Greece
and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and
Early Christians, which were lost at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of Constantine, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> iron

Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing
it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> back to
its <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in
this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get
back to its <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> mystic teachings.

But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the Flame,
tending it carefully, and not allowing its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> to become extinguished.
And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless minds, we have the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> still with us.  But it is not found in books, to any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent.
It has been passed along from <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> to Student; from Initiate to
Hierophant; from lip to ear. When it was <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down at all, its

possessing the key could read it aright. This was made necessary in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to avoid the persecutions of the theologians of the Middle Ages,
who fought the Secret Doctrine with <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and sword; stake, gibbet and
cross. Even to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> there will be found but few reliable books on
the Hermetic Philosophy, although there are countless references to it
in many books <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> on various phases of Occultism. And yet, the
Hermetic Philosophy is the only <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> Key which will open all the doors
of the Occult Teachings!

In the early days, there was a compilation of certain Basic Hermetic
Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, which was known as "THE
KYBALION," the exact significance and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of the term having been
lost for several centuries. This teaching, however, is known to many to
whom it has descended, from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the
centuries. Its precepts have never been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> down, or printed, so far
as we know. It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts,
which were non-understandable to outsiders, but which were readily
understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been
explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes.
These teachings really constituted the basic principles of "The <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Art</span> of
Hermetic Alchemy," which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the
mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements-the
Transmutation of one <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of
the changing of one <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of metal into another. The legends of the
"Philosopher's Stone" which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> turn base metal into Gold, was an
allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all
students of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Hermeticism.

In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite our
students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> forth in THE
KYBALION, and as explained by ourselves, humble students of the
Teachings, who, while bearing the title of Initiates, are still students
at the feet of HERMES, the Master. We herein give you many of the
maxims, axioms and precepts of THE KYBALION, accompanied by explanations
and illustrations which we deem likely to render the teachings more
easily comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the original
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">text</span> is purposely veiled in obscure terms.

The original maxims, axioms, and precepts of THE KYBALION are printed
herein, in italics, the proper credit being given. Our own <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
printed in the regular way, in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of the work. We trust that the
many students to whom we now offer this little <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> will derive as much
benefit from the study of its pages as have the many who have gone on
before, treading the same Path to Mastery throughout the centuries that
have passed since the times of HERMES TRISMEGISTUS--the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> of
Masters--the Great-Great. In the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of "THE KYBALION":

    "Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those
    ready for his Teaching open wide."--The Kybalion.

    "When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh
    the lips to fill them with Wisdom."--The Kybalion.

So that according to the Teachings, the <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> of this <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> to those
ready for the instruction will attract the attention of such as are
prepared to receive the Teaching. And, likewise, when the pupil is ready
to receive the truth, then will this little <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> come to him, or her.
Such is The Law. The Hermetic Principle of Cause and Effect, in its
aspect of The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Attraction, will <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> lips and ear together--pupil
and <span class="t6 t8 t10 t11 t16 t20 t21 t27 t28 hoverable">book</span> in company. So mote it be!

THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES

    "The Principles of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> are Seven; he who knows these,
    understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>
    touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open."--The Kybalion.

The Seven Hermetic Principles, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the entire Hermetic Philosophy
is based, are as follows:

    1. The Principle of Mentalism.
    2. The Principle of Correspondence.
    3. The Principle of Vibration.
    4. The Principle of Polarity.
    5. The Principle of Rhythm.
    6. The Principle of Cause and Effect.
    7. The Principle of Gender.

These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed
with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, may as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> be
given at this point.

1.  The Principle of Mentalism

    "THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that "All is Mind." It explains that

2.  The Principle of Correspondence

    "As above, so below; as below, so above."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that there is always a Correspondence
between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life.
The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: "As above, so below; as
below, so above." And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means
of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are
planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of
Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal
application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material,
mental, and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> universe--it is an Universal Law. The <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental
instruments by which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid
from <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> the Unknown. Its <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the
extent that a glimpse of the <span class="t3 hoverable">face</span> of the goddess might be caught. Just
as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the Principles of Geometry enables <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to measure

intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he

3.  The Principle of Vibration

    "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."--The
    Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that "everything is in motion";
"everything vibrates"; "nothing is at rest"; facts which Modern Science
endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, by
the Masters of <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> Egypt. This Principle explains that the
differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,
and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From
THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of Matter, all
is in vibration--the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> the vibration, the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> the position in
the scale. The vibration of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is at such an infinite rate of
intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly
moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale,
there are gross forms of matter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> vibrations are so low as to seem
at rest. Between these poles, there are millions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> millions of
varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and
molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion.
This is also <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> on the planes of energy and force (which are but
varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose
states depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> vibrations); and even on to the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes.
An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas,
enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the
conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. "He who understands
the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power," says one
of the old writers.

4.  The Principle of Polarity

    "Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its
    pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are
    identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;
    all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be
    reconciled."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that "everything is dual"; "everything
has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles"; "everything has its pair of opposites," all of which
were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have
perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: "Thesis and
antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree"; "opposites
are the same, differing only in degree"; "the pairs of opposites may be
reconciled"; "extremes meet"; "everything is and isn't, at the same
time"; "all truths are but half-truths"; "every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is half-false";
"there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides to everything," etc., etc., etc. It explains that
in everything there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles, or opposite aspects, and that
"opposites" are really only the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> extremes of the same thing, with
many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold,
although "opposites," are really the same thing, the differences
consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer
and see if you can discover where "heat" terminates and "cold" begins!
There is no such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as "absolute heat" or "absolute cold"--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
terms "heat" and "cold" simply indicate varying degrees of the same
thing, and that "same thing" which manifests as "heat" and "cold"
is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So "heat" and "cold"
are simply the "two poles" of that which we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> "Heat"--and the
phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of
Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of "Light and
Darkness," which are the same thing, the difference consisting of
varying degrees between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of the phenomena. Where does
"darkness" leave off, and "light" begin? What is the difference between
"Large and Small"? Between "Hard and Soft"? Between "Black and White"?
Between "Sharp and Dull"? Between "Noise and Quiet"? Between "High and
Low"? Between "Positive and Negative"? The Principle of Polarity
explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The
same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a radical and
extreme example--that of "Love and Hate," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> mental states apparently
totally different.  And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> there are degrees of Hate and degrees of
Love, and a middle point in which we <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the terms "Like or Dislike,"
which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss
to know <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> we "like" or "dislike" or "neither." And all are simply
degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a
moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance
by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to
the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others.
Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the
involuntary rapid transition from <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> to Hate, and the reverse, in your
own <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> and that of others.  And you will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> realize the
possibility of this being accomplished by the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the Will, by means
of the Hermetic formulas. "Good and Evil" are but the poles of the same
thing, and the Hermetist understands the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of transmuting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> into
Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,
the "Art of Polarization" becomes a phase of "Mental Alchemy" known and
practiced by the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding
of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
that of others, if he will devote the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and study necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span>
the art.

5.  The Principle of Rhythm

    "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;
    all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in
    everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the
    measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates."--The
    Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that in everything there is manifested
a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and
forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide
and low-tide; between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles which exist in accordance with the
Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action
and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This
is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,
energy, and matter.  This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> is manifest in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and
destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
all things; and finally in the mental states of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> (and it is with this
latter that the Hermetists <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> the understanding of the Principle most
important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its
universal application, and have also discovered certain means to
overcome its effects in themselves by the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the appropriate
formulas and methods. They apply the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Neutralization. They
cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they
have learned how to escape its effects <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> themselves to a certain
degree depending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned
how to <span class="t1 hoverable">USE</span> it, instead of being <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">USED</span> BY it. In this and similar
methods, consist the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Art</span> of the Hermetists. The <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> of Hermetics
polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then
neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> tend to carry
him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of
Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously,
but the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> does this consciously, and by the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of his Will, and
attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of
belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like
a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely
studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting,
neutralizing, and USING them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an important part of the Hermetic
Mental Alchemy.

6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect

    "Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;
    everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name
    for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> not recognized; there are many planes of causation,
    but nothing escapes the Law."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that there is a Cause for every Effect;
an Effect from every Cause. It explains that:  "Everything Happens
according to Law"; that nothing ever "merely happens"; that there is no
such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and
Effect, the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever
entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> and methods
of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain
degree, and by mentally rising to a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane they become Causers
instead of Effects. The masses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are carried along, obedient to
environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves;
heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like
pawns on the Chessboard of Life. But the Masters, rising to the plane
above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span>
as the environment surrounding them, and become Movers instead of pawns.
They help to PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE, instead of being played and moved
about by other wills and environment. They <span class="t1 hoverable">USE</span> the Principle instead of
being its tools. The Masters obey the Causation of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes,
but they help to RULE on their own plane. In this statement there is
condensed a wealth of Hermetic knowledge--let him read who can.

7.  The Principle of Gender

    "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine
    and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all
    planes."--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that there is GENDER manifested in
everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> not only of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, but of the Mental and even the
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Planes. On the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX,
on the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes it takes <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms, but the Principle is ever
the same.  No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> this Principle. An understanding of its laws will throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on
many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of
Gender <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and
creation. Everything, and every person, contains the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Elements or
Principles, or this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Principle, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> it, him or her. Every Male
<span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> has the Female Element also; every Female contains also the Male
Principle.  If you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> understand the philosophy of Mental and
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand
and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many
mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference
to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings
and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a
prostitution of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> natural principle of Gender. Such base
revivals of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust,
licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such
teachings, you must go elsewhere for them--Hermeticism contains nothing
for you along these lines. To the pure, all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are pure; to the

MENTAL TRANSMUTATION

    "Mind (as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as metals and elements) may be transmuted,
    from <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> to state; degree to degree; condition to condition;
    pole to pole; vibration to vibration. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">True</span> Hermetic Transmutation
    is a Mental Art."--The Kybalion.

As we have stated, the Hermetists were the original alchemists,
astrologers, and psychologists, Hermes having been the founder of these
schools of thought. From astrology has grown modern astronomy; from
alchemy has grown modern chemistry; from the mystic psychology has grown
the modern psychology of the schools. But it must not be supposed that
the ancients were ignorant of that which the modern schools suppose to
be their exclusive and special property. The records engraved on the
stones of <span class="t21 hoverable">Ancient</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span> show conclusively that the ancients had a <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span>
comprehensive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of astronomy, the very building of the Pyramids
showing the connection between their design and the study of
astronomical science. Nor were they ignorant of Chemistry, for the
fragments of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> writings show that they were acquainted with
the chemical properties of things; in fact, the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> theories
regarding physics are being slowly verified by the latest discoveries of
modern science, notably those relating to the constitution of matter.
Nor must it be supposed that they were ignorant of the so-called modern
discoveries in psychology--on the contrary, the Egyptians were
especially skilled in the science of Psychology, particularly in the
branches that the modern schools ignore, but which, nevertheless, are
being uncovered under the name of "psychic science" which is perplexing
the psychologists of to-day, and making them reluctantly admit that
"there may be something in it after all."

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is, that beneath the material chemistry, astronomy and
psychology (that is, the psychology in its phase of "brain-action") the
ancients possessed a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of transcendental astronomy, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
astrology; of transcendental chemistry, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> alchemy; of
transcendental psychology, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> mystic psychology. They possessed the
Inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the Outer Knowledge, the latter alone being
possessed by modern scientists. Among the many secret branches of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> possessed by the Hermetists, was that known as Mental
Transmutation, which forms the subject matter of this lesson.

"Transmutation" is a term usually employed to designate the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span>
of the transmutation of metals--particularly of the base metals into
gold. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Transmute" means "to change from one nature, form, or
substance, into another; to transform" (Webster). And accordingly,
"Mental Transmutation" means the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of changing and transforming mental
states, forms, and conditions, into others. So you may see that Mental
Transmutation is the "Art of Mental Chemistry," if you like the term--a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of practical Mystic Psychology.

But this means far more than appears on the surface. Transmutation,
Alchemy, or Chemistry on the Mental Plane is important enough in its
effects, to be sure, and if the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> stopped there it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> still be one
of the most important branches of study known to man. But this is only
the beginning. Let us see why!

The first of the Seven Hermetic Principles is the Principle of
Mentalism, the axiom of which is "THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is
Mental," which means that the Underlying Reality of the Universe is
Mind; and the Universe itself is Mental--that is, "existing in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
of THE ALL." We shall consider this Principle in succeeding lessons, but
let us see the effect of the principle if it be assumed to be true.

If the Universe is Mental in its nature, then Mental Transmutation must
be the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, along the lines
of Matter, Force and mind. So you see, therefore, that Mental
Transmutation is really the "Magic" of which the ancient; writers had so
much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few
practical instructions. If All be Mental, then the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> which enables one
to transmute mental conditions must render the <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> the controller of
material conditions as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as those ordinarily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "mental."

As a matter of fact, none but advanced Mental Alchemists have been able
to attain the degree of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> necessary to control the grosser <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the
production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of
earthquakes and other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> phenomena. But that such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have
existed, and do exist today, is a matter of earnest belief to all
advanced occultists of all schools. That the Masters exist, and have
these powers, the best teachers assure their students, having had
experiences which justify them in such belief and statements. These
Masters do not make public exhibitions of their powers, but seek
seclusion from the crowds of men, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to better <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> their may
along the Path of Attainment. We mention their existence, at this point,
merely to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> your attention to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> is entirely
Mental, and operates along the lines of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> Mental Transmutation,
under the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.

    "The Universe is Mental"--The Kybalion.

But students and Hermetists of lesser degree than Masters--the Initiates
and Teachers--are able to freely <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> along the Mental Plane, in Mental
Transmutation. In <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> all that we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> "psychic phenomena,"; "mental
influence"; "mental science"; "new-thought phenomena," etc., operates
along the same general lines, for there is but one principle involved,
no matter by what name the phenomena be called.

The student and practitioner of Mental Transmutation <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> among the
Mental Plane, transmuting mental conditions, states, etc., into others,
according to various formulas, more or less efficacious. The various
"treatments," "affirmations," "denials" etc., of the schools of mental
science are but formulas, often quite imperfect and unscientific, of The

Not only may the mental states, etc., of one's self be changed or
transmuted by Hermetic Methods; but also the states of others may be,
and are, constantly transmuted in the same way, usually unconsciously,
but often consciously by some understanding the laws and principles, in
cases where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> affected are not informed of the principles of

of modern mental science know, every material condition depending <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

with the earnest desire, will, and "treatments" of <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> desiring

regarding these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> at present, that we do not deem it necessary to

THE ALL

    "Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change,
    is ever to be found The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental
    Truth."--The Kybalion.

"Substance" means: "that which underlies all outward manifestations; the
essence; the essential reality; the <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> in itself," etc. "Substantial"
means: "actually existing; being the essential element; being real," etc.
"Reality" means: "the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed;
permanent; actual," etc.

Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there must
always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> considering the
Universe, of which he is a unit, sees nothing but change in matter,
forces, and mental states. He sees that nothing really IS, but that
everything is BECOMING and CHANGING. Nothing stands still-everything is
being born, growing, dying-the very instant a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> reaches its height,
it begins to decline--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of rhythm is in constant operation--there
is no reality, enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything--
nothing is permanent but Change. He sees all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> evolving from other
things, and resolving into other things--constant action and reaction;
inflow and outflow; building up and tearing down; <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and
destruction; birth, growth and death. Nothing endures but Change. And if
he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> must
be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying
Power--some Substantial Reality.

All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity
for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All
philosophies worthy of the name have been based <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this thought. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span>
have given to this Substantial Reality many names-some have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it by
the term of Deity (under many titles). Others have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> it "The
Infinite and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">Eternal</span> Energy" others have tried to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> it "Matter"--but
all have acknowledged its existence. It is self-evident it needs no
argument.

In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's
greatest thinkers, both <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the
Hermetic name of "THE ALL," which term we consider the most
comprehensive of the many terms applied by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> to THAT which transcends
names and terms.

We accept and teach the <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hermetic thinkers of all
times, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as of those illumined souls who have reached <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
planes of being, both of whom assert that the inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL is
UNKNOWABLE. This must be so, for naught by THE ALL itself can comprehend
its own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and being.

The Hermetists believe and teach that THE ALL, "in itself," is and must
ever be UNKNOWABLE. They regard all the theories, guesses and
speculations of the theologians and metaphysicians regarding the inner
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL, as but the childish efforts of mortal minds to grasp
the secret of the Infinite. Such efforts have always failed and will
always fail, from the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the task. One pursuing such
inquiries travels around and around in the labyrinth of thought, until
he is lost to all sane reasoning, action or conduct, and is utterly
unfitted for the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of life. He is like the squirrel which frantically
runs around and around the circling treadmill wheel of his cage,
traveling ever and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> reaching nowhere--at the end a prisoner still,
and standing just where he started.

And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL
the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes
of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> emotions, feelings, and
characteristics, even down to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as
jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> for offerings
and worship, and all the other survivals from the <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">days</span> of the childhood
of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women, and are
rapidly being discarded.

(At this point, it may be proper for me to <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> that we make a
distinction between Religion and Theology--between Philosophy and
Metaphysics. Religion, to us, means that intuitional realization of the
existence of THE ALL, and one's relationship to it; while Theology means
the attempts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to ascribe personality, qualities, and
characteristics to it; their theories regarding its affairs, will,
desires, plans, and designs, and their assumption of the office of ''
middle-men'' between THE ALL and the people. Philosophy, to us, means
the inquiry after <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> knowable and thinkable; while
Metaphysics means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond the
boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable, and with the
same tendency as that of Theology. And consequently, both Religion and
Philosophy mean to us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> having roots in Reality, while Theology and
Metaphysics seem like broken reeds, rooted in the quicksands of
ignorance, and affording naught but the most insecure support for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> of Man. we do not insist <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> our students accepting these
definitions--we mention them merely to show our position.
At any rate, you shall hear very little about Theology and Metaphysics
in these lessons.)

But while the essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL is Unknowable, there are
certain truths connected with its existence which the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> finds
itself compelled to accept. And an examination of these reports <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a

of the Illumined on <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes. And to this inquiry we now invite
you.

    "THAT which is the Fundamental Truth--the Substantial

attempting to remove the veil of the Unknowable:

    (1) THE ALL must be ALL that REALLY IS. There can be
    nothing existing outside of THE ALL, else THE ALL <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
    not be THE ALL.

    (2) THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else
    to define, confine, bound, limit; or restrict THE ALL.
    It must be Infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,--it must have
    always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to
    have ever created it, and something can never evolve from
    nothing, and if it had ever "not been," even for a moment,
    it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not "be" now,--it must continuously exist forever,
    for there is nothing to destroy it, and it can never
    "not-be," even for a moment, because something can never
    become nothing. It must be Infinite in Space--it must be
    Everywhere, for there is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> outside of THE ALL--it
    cannot be otherwise than continuous in Space, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> break,
    cessation, separation, or interruption, for there is nothing
    to break, separate, or interrupt its continuity, and nothing
    with which to "fill in the gaps." It must be Infinite in
    Power, or Absolute, for there is nothing to limit, restrict,
    restrain, confine, disturb or condition it--it is subject to
    no other Power, for there is no other Power.

    (3) THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE, or not subject to change in
    its real nature, for there is nothing to <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> changes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> it
    nothing into which it could change, nor from which it could
    have changed. It cannot be added to nor subtracted from;
    increased nor diminished; nor become greater or lesser in any
    respect whatsoever. It must have always been, and must always
    remain, just what it is now--THE ALL--there has never been,
    is not now, and never will be, anything else into which it
    can change.

THE ALL being Infinite, Absolute, <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">Eternal</span> and Unchangeable it must
follow that anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned
cannot be THE ALL. And as there is Nothing outside of THE ALL, in
Reality, then any and all such finite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> must be as Nothing in
Reality. Now do not become befogged, nor frightened--we are not trying
to lead you into the Christian Science field under cover of Hermetic
Philosophy. There is a Reconciliation of this apparently contradictory
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of affairs. Be patient, we will reach it in time.

We see around us that which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Matter," which forms the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
foundation for all forms. Is THE ALL merely Matter? Not at all! Matter
cannot manifest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> or Mind, and as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> are manifested in the
Universe, THE ALL cannot be Matter, for nothing rises <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than its
own source--nothing is ever manifested in an effect that is not in the
cause--nothing is evolved as a consequent that is not involved as an
antecedent. And then Modern Science informs us that there is really no
such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as Matter--that what we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> Matter is merely "interrupted
energy or force," that is, energy or force at a low rate of vibration.
As a recent writer has said "Matter has melted into Mystery." Even
Material Science has abandoned the theory of Matter, and now rests on
the basis of "Energy."

Then is THE ALL mere Energy or Force? Not Energy or Force as the
materialists <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the terms, for their energy and force are blind,
mechanical things, devoid of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> or Mind. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> can never
evolve from blind Energy or Force, for the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> given a moment ago:
"Nothing can rise <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than its source--nothing is evolved unless it
is involved--nothing manifests in the effect, unless it is in the cause.
" And so THE ALL cannot be mere Energy or Force, for, if it were, then
there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be no such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> in existence, and we know

question, and so are those who claim that Energy or Force is Everything.

What is there then <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> than Matter or Energy that we know to be
existent in the Universe? <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">LIFE</span> AND MIND! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> in all their

THE MENTAL UNIVERSE

    "The Universe is Mental--held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE

THE ALL is SPIRIT! But what is Spirit? This question cannot be answered,
for the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that its definition is practically that of THE ALL, which
cannot be explained or defined. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is simply a name that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> give to

may think or <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of THE ALL. For the purposes of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> and
understanding, we are justified in thinking of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> as Infinite Living
Mind, at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> acknowledging that we cannot fully understand it.
We must either do this or stop thinking of the matter at all.

Let us now proceed to a consideration of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe, as
a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> and in its parts. What is the Universe? We have seen that there
can be nothing outside of THE ALL. Then is the Universe THE ALL? No,
this cannot be, because the Universe seems to be made up of MANY, and is
constantly changing, and in other ways it does not measure up to the
ideas that we are compelled to accept regarding THE ALL, as stated in
our last lesson. Then if the Universe be not THE ALL, then it must be
Nothing--such is the inevitable conclusion of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> at first thought.
But this will not satisfy the question, for we are sensible of the
existence of the Universe. Then if the Universe is neither THE ALL, nor
Nothing, what Can it be? Let us examine this question.

If the Universe exists at all, or seems to exist, it must proceed in
some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> from THE ALL--it must be a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of THE ALL. But as
something can never come from nothing, from what could THE ALL have
created it. Some philosophers have answered this question by saying that
THE ALL created the Universe from ITSELF--that is, from the being and
substance of THE ALL. But this will not do, for THE ALL cannot be
subtracted from, nor divided, as we have seen, and then again if this be
so, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not each particle in the Universe be aware of its being THE
ALL--THE ALL could not lose its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of itself, nor actually BECOME
an atom, or blind force, or lowly living thing. Some men, indeed,
realizing that THE ALL is indeed ALL, and also recognizing that they,
the men, existed, have jumped to the conclusion that they and THE ALL
were identical, and they have filled the air with shouts of "I AM GOD,"
to the amusement of the multitude and the sorrow of sages. The claim of
the corpuscle that: "I am Man!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be modest in comparison.

But, what indeed is the Universe, if it be not THE ALL, not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> created
by THE ALL having separated itself into fragments? What else can it be--
of what else can it be made? This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> question. Let us examine
it carefully. We <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> here that the "Principle of Correspondence" (see
Lesson I.) comes to our aid here. The old Hermetic axiom, "As above so
below," may be pressed into service at this point. Let us endeavor to
get a glimpse of the workings on <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes by examining those on our
own. The Principle of Correspondence must apply to this as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as to
other problems.

Let us see! On his own plane of being, how does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> create? Well, first,
he may create by making something out of outside materials. But this
will not do, for there are no materials outside of THE ALL with which it
may create. Well, then, secondly, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> pro-creates or reproduces his <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span>
by the process of begetting, which is self-multiplication accomplished
by transferring a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this
will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer or subtract a portion of
itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself--in the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>

addition to THE ALL, both thoughts being an absurdity. Is there no <span class="t26 hoverable">third</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> in which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">MAN</span> creates? Yes, there is--he CREATES MENTALLY! And in so
doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> pervades the Mental Creation.

Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in
considering that THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin
to the process whereby <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> creates Mental Images. And, here is where the
report of <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Reason</span> tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as
shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the
<span class="t5 t8 hoverable">Wise</span> Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes.

THE ALL can create in no other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> except mentally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> either using
material (and there is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which
is also impossible). There is no escape from this conclusion of the
Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> teachings of the
Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in
your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality.
But your Universe is the mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of a Finite Mind, whereas that
of THE ALL is the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of an Infinite. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are similar in kind,
but infinitely different in degree. We shall examine more closely into
the process of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and manifestation as we proceed. But this is the
point to fix in your minds at this stage: THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT
CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">CREATION</span> OF THE ALL. Verily indeed, ALL IS MIND!

    "THE ALL creates in its Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> countless Universes,

    is as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of the twinkling of an eye."--The Kybalion.

    "The Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL is the womb of Universes."--The
    Kybalion.

The Principle of Gender (see Lesson I. and other lessons to follow) is
manifested on all planes of life, material mental and spiritual. But,
as we have said before, "Gender" does not mean "Sex" sex is merely a
material manifestation of gender. "Gender" means "relating to generation
or creation." And whenever anything is generated or created, on any
plane, the Principle of Gender must be manifested. And this is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> even
in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of Universes.

Now do not jump to the conclusion that we are teaching that there is a
male and female God, or Creator. That <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is merely a distortion of the
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> teachings on the subject. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> teaching is that THE ALL, in
itself, is above Gender, as it is above every other Law, including those
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> and Space. It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is
not subject to them. But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of
generation or creation, then it acts according to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and Principle, for
it is moving on a lower plane of Being. And consequently it manifests
the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the
Mental Plane, of course.

This <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> may seem startling to some of you who hear it for the first
time, but you have all really passively accepted it in your everyday
conceptions. You <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> of the Fatherhood of God, and the Motherhood of
Nature--of God, the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Father, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> the Universal Mother--and
have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> instinctively acknowledged the Principle of Gender in the
Universe. Is this not so?

But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality--THE ALL is
ONE--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span> Aspects are merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching
is that The Masculine Principle manifested by THE ALL stands, in a way,
apart from the actual mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe. It projects its
Will toward the Feminine Principle (which may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Nature")
whereupon the latter begins the actual <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the evolution of the
Universe, from simple "centers of activity" on to man, and then on and
on still higher, all according to well-established and firmly enforced
Laws of Nature. If you prefer the old figures of thought, you may think
of the Masculine Principle as GOD, the Father, and of the Feminine
Principle as NATURE, the Universal Mother, from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> womb all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
have been born. This is more than a mere poetic figure of speech--it is
an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the actual process of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe. But
always remember, that THE ALL is but One, and that in its Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
the Universe is generated, created and exists.

It may help you to get the proper idea, if you will apply the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of
Correspondence to yourself, and your own mind. You know that the part of
You which you <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> "I," in a sense, stands apart and witnesses the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of mental Images in your own mind. The part of your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> in

distinction from the "I" which stands apart and witnesses and examines
the thoughts, ideas and images of the "Me."  "As above, so below,"
remember, and the phenomena of one plane may be employed to solve the
riddles of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> or lower planes.

Is it any wonder that You, the child, feel that instinctive reverence
for THE ALL, which feeling we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> "religion"--that respect, and
reverence for THE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">FATHER</span> MIND? Is it any wonder that, when you consider

which has its roots away down in your inmost being? It is the MOTHER

    "The half-wise, recognizing the comparative unreality of
    the Universe, imagine that they may defy its Laws--such
    are vain and presumptuous fools, and they are broken against

    the pains of the lower planes by vibrating on the higher.
    Transmutation, not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the
    Master."--The Kybalion.

This is the Paradox of the Universe, resulting from the Principle of
Polarity which manifests when THE ALL begins to Create--hearken to it
for it points the difference between half-wisdom and wisdom. While to
THE INFINITE ALL, the Universe, its Laws, its Powers, its life, its
Phenomena, are as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> witnessed in the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of Meditation or Dream;

life, and action, and thought, must be based thereupon, accordingly,
although with an ever understanding of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Truth. Each according
to its own Plane and Laws. Were THE ALL to imagine that the Universe
were indeed Reality, then woe to the Universe, for there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be then
no escape from lower to higher, divineward--then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> the Universe

to half-wisdom, acts and lives and thinks of the Universe as merely a
dream (akin to his own finite dreams) then indeed does it so become for
him, and like a sleep-walker he stumbles ever around and around in a
circle, making no progress, and being forced into an awakening at last
by his falling bruised and bleeding over the Natural Laws which he
ignored. Keep your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> ever on the Star, but let your <span class="t2 t6 t19 t20 t26 t29 hoverable">eyes</span> watch over

Principle of Polarity. The Hermetic writings are filled with references
to the appearance of the Paradox in the consideration of the problems of

against the error of omitting the "other side" of any question. And
their warnings are particularly directed to the problems of the Absolute
and the Relative, which perplex all students of philosophy, and which
cause so many to think and act contrary to what is generally known as
"common sense." And we caution all students to be sure to grasp the

against which <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> his instincts revolt. But this, like all other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
truths, must be considered both from the Absolute and the Relative
points of view. From the Absolute viewpoint, of course, the Universe is
in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of an illusion, a dream, a phantasmagoria, as compared to
THE ALL in itself. We recognize this even in our ordinary view, for we

dies--for the element of impermanence and change, finiteness and
unsubstantiality, must ever be connected with the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of a created
Universe when it is contrasted with the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of THE ALL, no matter what
may be our beliefs concerning the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of both. Philosopher,
metaphysician, scientist and theologian all agree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this idea, and

conceptions, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as in the theories of the respective schools of
metaphysics and theology.

So, the Hermetic Teachings do not preach the unsubstantiality of the
Universe in any stronger terms than those more familiar to you, although
their presentation of the subject may seem somewhat more startling.
Anything that has a beginning and an ending must be, in a sense, unreal
and untrue, and the Universe comes under the rule, in all schools of
thought. From the Absolute point of view, there is nothing Real except
THE ALL, no matter what terms we may <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> in thinking of, or discussing
the subject. <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">Whether</span> the Universe be created of Matter, or <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> it be

non-enduring, a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> of time, space and change. We want you to realize
this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> thoroughly, before you <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> judgment on the Hermetic
conception of the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe. Think over any and all
of the other conceptions, and see <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span> this be not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of them.

But the Absolute point of <span class="t25 hoverable">view</span> shows merely one side of the picture--the
other side is the Relative one. Absolute <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> has been defined as
"Things as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> knows them," while Relative <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Truth</span> is "Things

And so while to THE ALL
the Universe must be unreal and illusionary, a mere dream or result of
meditation,--nevertheless, to the finite minds forming a part of that
Universe, and viewing it through mortal faculties, the Universe is very
real indeed, and must be so considered. In recognizing the Absolute
view, we must not make the mistake of ignoring or denying the facts and
phenomena of the Universe as they present themselves to our mortal
faculties--we are not THE ALL, remember.

To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> familiar illustrations, we all recognize the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that matter
"exists" to our senses--we will fare badly if we do not. And yet, even
our finite minds understand the scientific dictum that there is no such
<span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as Matter from a scientific point of view--that which we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span>
Matter is held to be merely an aggregation of atoms, which atoms
themselves are merely a grouping of units of force, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> electrons or
"ions," vibrating and in constant circular motion. We kick a stone and
we feel the impact--it seems to be real, notwithstanding that we know it
to be merely what we have stated above. But remember that our foot,
which feels the impact by means of our brains, is likewise Matter, so
constituted of electrons, and for that matter so are our brains. And, at
the best, if it were not by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of our Mind, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not know the
foot or stone at all.

Then again, the ideal of the artist or sculptor, which he is endeavoring
to reproduce in stone or on canvas, seems very real to him. So do the
characters in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the author; or dramatist, which he seeks to
express so that others may recognize them. And if this be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> in the
<span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of our finite minds, what must be the degree of Reality in the
Mental Images created in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of the Infinite? Oh, friends, to
mortals this Universe of Mentality is very real indeed--it is the only
one we can ever know, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> we rise from plane to plane, <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in it. To know it otherwise, but actual experience, we must be
THE ALL itself. It is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> we rise in the scale--the
nearer to "the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of the Father" we reach--the more apparent becomes
the illusory <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of finite things, but not until THE ALL finally
withdraws us into itself does the vision actually vanish.

So, we need not dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the feature of illusion. Rather let us,
recognizing the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe, seek to understand its
mental laws, and endeavor to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> them to the best effect in our upward
progress through life, as we travel from plane to plane of being. The
Laws of the Universe are none the less "Iron Laws" because of the mental
nature. All, except THE ALL, are bound by them. What is IN THE INFINITE
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">MIND</span> OF THE ALL is REAL in a degree <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> only to that Reality itself
which is vested in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of THE ALL.

So, do not feel insecure or afraid--we are all HELD FIRMLY IN THE
INFINITE <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">MIND</span> OF THE ALL, and there is naught to hurt us or for us to
fear. There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> outside of THE ALL to affect us. So we may rest
calm and secure. There is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of comfort and security in this
realization when once attained. Then "calm and peaceful do we sleep,
rocked in the Cradle of the Deep"--resting safely on the bosom of the
Ocean of Infinite Mind, which is THE ALL. In THE ALL, indeed, do "we
live and move and have our being."

Matter is none the less Matter to us, while we dwell on the plane of
Matter, although we know it to be merely an aggregation of "electrons,"
or particles of Force, vibrating rapidly and gyrating around each other
in the formations of atoms; the atoms in turn vibrating and gyrating,
forming molecules, which latter in turn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> larger masses of Matter.
Nor does Matter become less Matter, when we follow the inquiry still
further, and learn from the Hermetic Teachings, that the "Force" of
which the electrons are but units is merely a manifestation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
of THE ALL, and like all else in the Universe is purely Mental in its
nature. While on the Plane of matter, we must recognize its phenomena--
we may control Matter (as all Masters of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> or lesser degree do),
but we do so by applying the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forces. We commit a folly when we
attempt to deny the existence of Matter in the relative aspect. We may
deny its mastery over us--and rightly so--but we should not attempt to
ignore it in its relative aspect, at least so <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as we dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its
plane.

Nor do the Laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> become less constant or effective, when we
know them, likewise, to be merely mental creations. They are in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span>
effect on the various planes. We overcome the lower laws, by applying
still <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> ones--and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> only. But we cannot escape <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> or
rise above it entirely. Nothing but THE ALL can escape Law--and that
because THE ALL is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">LAW</span> itself, from which all Laws emerge. The most
advanced Masters may acquire the powers usually attributed to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span>

Nothing in the eye of THE ALL. So that if even these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Beings,

these are bound by and are subservient to Law, then imagine the
presumption of mortal man, of our race and grade, when he dares to
consider the Laws of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> as "unreal!" visionary and illusory, because

nature, and simply Mental Creations of THE ALL. Those Laws which THE ALL
intends to be governing Laws are not to be defied or argued away. So
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> as the Universe endures, will they endure--for the Universe exists

The Hermetic Principle of Mentalism, while explaining the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of

scientific conceptions of the Universe, Life, or Evolution. In fact,
science merely corroborates the Hermetic Teachings. The latter merely
teaches that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the Universe is "Mental," while modern
science has taught that it is "Material"; or (of late) that it is
"Energy" at the last analysis. The Hermetic Teachings have no fault to
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> with Herbert Spencer's basic principle which postulates the
existence of an "Infinite and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">Eternal</span> Energy, from which all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span>
proceed." In fact, the Hermetics recognize in Spencer's philosophy the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> outside statement of the workings of the Natural Laws that have
ever been promulgated, and they believe Spencer to have been a
reincarnation of an <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> philosopher who dwelt in <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> <span class="t6 hoverable">Egypt</span>
thousands of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> ago, and who later incarnated as Heraclitus, the
Grecian philosopher who lived B. C. 500. And they regard his statement
of the "Infinite and <span class="t0 t28 hoverable">Eternal</span> Energy" as directly in the line of the
Hermetic Teachings, always with the addition of their own doctrine
that his "Energy" is the Energy of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL. With the
Master-Key of the Hermetic Philosophy, the student of Spencer will be
able to unlock many doors of the inner philosophical conceptions of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> English philosopher, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> shows the results of the
preparation of his previous incarnations. His teachings regarding
Evolution and Rhythm are in almost perfect agreement with the Hermetic
Teachings regarding the Principle of Rhythm.

So, the student of Hermetics need not lay aside any of his cherished
scientific views regarding the Universe. All he is asked to do is to
grasp the underlying principle of "THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is
Mental--held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of THE ALL." He will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that the other six of
the Seven Principles will "fit into" his scientific knowledge, and will
serve to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> out obscure points and to throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> in dark corners.
This is not to be wondered at, when we realize the influence of the
Hermetic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> of the early philosophers of Greece, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span>

acceptance of the First Hermetic Principle (Mentalism) is the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>
point of difference between Modern Science and Hermetic students, and
Science is gradually moving toward the Hermetic position in its groping
in the dark for a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> out of the Labyrinth into which it has wandered in
its search for Reality.

The purpose of this lesson is to impress <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the minds of our students
the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that, to all intents and purposes, the Universe and its laws,
and its phenomena, are just as REAL, so far as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> is concerned, as they

hypothesis the Universe in its outer aspect is changing, ever-flowing,
and transitory--and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> devoid of substantiality and reality. But
(note the other pole of the truth) under the same hypotheses, we are
compelled to ACT AND LIVE as if the fleeting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> were real and
substantial. With this difference, always, between the various
hypotheses--that under the old views Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Power</span> was ignored as a
Natural Force, while under Mentalism it becomes the Greatest Natural
Force. And this one difference revolutionizes Life, to those who
understand the Principle and its resulting laws and practice.

So, finally, students all, grasp the advantage of Mentalism, and learn
to know, <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> and apply the laws resulting therefrom. But do not yield to
the temptation which, as The Kybalion states, overcomes the half-wise
and which causes them to be hypnotized by the apparent unreality of
things, the consequence being that they wander about like dream-people
dwelling in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of dreams, ignoring the practical <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of
man, the end being that "they are broken against the rocks and torn
asunder by the elements, by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of their folly." Rather follow the
example of the wise, which the same authority states, "use <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> against

that which is undesirable into that which is worthy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> triumph."
Following the authority, let us avoid the half-wisdom (which is folly)
which ignores the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that: "Mastery consists not in abnormal dreams,
visions, and fantastic imaginings or living, but in using the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
forces against the lower--escaping the pains of the lower planes by
vibrating on the higher." Remember always, student, that "Transmutation,
not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the Master." The above
quotations are from The Kybalion, and are worthy of being committed to
memory by the student.

We do not live in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of dreams, but in an Universe which while
relative, is real so far as our lives and actions are concerned. Our
business in the Universe is not to deny its existence, but to LIVE,
using the Laws to rise from lower to higher--living on, doing the best
that we can under the circumstances arising each day, and living, so far
as is possible, to our biggest ideas and ideals.

no mistake in living up to the best that is in us, so far as is
possible, and realising the Universal tendency in the same direction in
spite of apparent evidence to the contrary. We are all on The Path--and
the road leads upward ever, with frequent resting places.

Read the message of The Kybalion--and follow the example of "the
wise"--avoiding the mistake of "the half-wise" who perish by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of
their folly.

How often have the majority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> repeated the statement that
their Deity (called by many names) was "All in All" and how little have
they suspected the inner occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> concealed by these carelessly
uttered words? The commonly <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> expression is a survival of the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span>
Hermetic Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: "To him who truly
understands this truth, <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">hath</span> come <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> knowledge." And, this being so,
let us seek this truth, the understanding of which means so much. In
this statement of truth--this Hermetic Maxim--is concealed one of the
greatest philosophical, scientific and religious truths.

We have given you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> of
the Universe--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that "the Universe is Mental--held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
of THE ALL." As the Kybalion says, in the <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> quoted above: "All is
in THE ALL." But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> also the co-related statement, that: "It is
equally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that THE ALL is in ALL." This apparently contradictory
statement is reconcilable under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Paradox. It is, moreover, an
exact Hermetic statement of the relations existing between THE ALL and
its Mental Universe. We have seen how "All is in THE ALL"--now let us
examine the other aspect of the subject.

The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in
("remaining within; inherent; abiding within") its Universe, and in
every part, particle, unit, or combination, <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> the Universe. This
statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the
Principle of Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a
Mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental
form, the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming
an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of
an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student
will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that while the image has its existence, and being, solely
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> his own mind, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or
sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding
within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life,
spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the "immanent
mind" of the thinker. Consider this for a moment, until the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is
grasped.

To <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> a modern example, let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear,
Richard III, existed merely in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of Shakespeare, at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of
their conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span>
each of these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and
action. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Whose</span> is the "spirit" of the characters that we know as
Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah Heep--is it Dickens, or have each of these

Venus of Medici, the Sistine Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and
reality of their own, or do they represent the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> and mental

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Paradox explains that both
propositions are true, viewed from the proper viewpoints. Micawber is
both Micawber, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> Dickens. And, again, while Micawber may be said
to be Dickens, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> Dickens is not identical with Micawber. Man, like
Micawber, may exclaim: "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of my Creator is inherent <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> me--

vociferously announced by certain of the half-wise, who fill the air
with their raucous cries of: "I am God!" Imagine poor Micawber, or the

there be any greater mystery than this of "All in THE ALL; and THE ALL
in All?"

The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Creation</span> of
the Universe, are that at the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL,
in its aspect of Being, projects its Will toward its aspect of
"Becoming" and the process of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> begins. It is taught that the
process consists of the lowering of Vibration until a very low degree of
vibratory energy is reached, at which point the grossest possible <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span>
of Matter is manifested. This process is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the stage of Involution,
in which THE ALL becomes "involved," or "wrapped up," in its creation.
This process is believed by the Hermetists to have a Correspondence to
the mental process of an artist, writer, or inventor, who becomes so
wrapped up in his mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> as to almost forget his own existence
and who, for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> being, almost "lives in his creation," If instead
of "wrapped" we <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "rapt," perhaps we will give a better <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
of what is meant.

This Involuntary stage of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Creation</span> is sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the "Outpouring"
of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Energy, just as the Evolutionary <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the
"Indrawing." The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to
be the furthest removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the
Evolutionary stage is regarded as the beginning of the return swing of
the pendulum of Rhythm--a "coming home" <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> being held in all of the
Hermetic Teachings.

The Teachings are that during the "Outpouring," the vibrations become
lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing
begins. But there is this difference, that while in the "Outpouring" the
creative forces manifest compactly and as a whole, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> from the

Units of Force, so that finally that which <span class="t1 t7 t12 t29 hoverable">left</span> THE ALL as
unindividualized energy returns to its source as countless highly
developed Units of Life, having risen <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale by

process of the mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL,
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Contemplation" also being frequently employed. But the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
intended seems to be that of the employment of the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Attention.
"Attention" is a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> derived from the Latin root, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> "to reach
out; to stretch out," and so the act of Attention is really a mental
"reaching out; extension" of mental energy, so that the underlying <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span>
is readily understood when we examine into the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of
"Attention."

The Hermetic Teachings regarding the process of Evolution are that, THE
ALL, having meditated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the beginning of the Creation--having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
established the material foundations of the Universe--having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> it
into existence--then gradually awakens or rouses from its Meditation and
in so doing starts into manifestation the process of Evolution, on the
material mental and <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes, successively and in order. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span>
the upward movement begins--and all begins to move Spiritward. Matter
becomes less gross; the Units spring into being; the combinations begin
to form; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> appears and manifests in <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span>
becomes more and more in evidence--the vibrations constantly becoming
higher. In short, the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases,
begins, and proceeds according to the established "Laws of the
Indrawing" process. All of this occupies aeons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> aeons of Man's time,

inform us that the entire creation, including Involution and Evolution,
of an Universe, is but "as the twinkle of the eye" to THE ALL.  At the
end of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE ALL withdraws its
Attention--its Contemplation and Meditation--of the Universe, for the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Work</span> is finished--and All is withdrawn into THE ALL from which it
emerged. But Mystery of Mysteries--the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> is not
annihilated, but is infinitely expanded--the Created and the Creator are
merged. Such is the report of the Illumined!

The above illustration of the "meditation," and subsequent "awakening
from meditation," of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the
teachers to describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet:
"As Below, so Above." The difference is merely in degree. And just as
THE ALL arouses itself from the meditation <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Universe, so does
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> (in time) cease from manifesting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Material Plane, and
withdraws himself more and more into the Indwelling Spirit, which is
indeed "The <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Ego."

There is one more matter of which we <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> in this lesson, and
that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of
speculation, although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such
speculation. We allude to the question which inevitably comes to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of all thinkers who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question
is: "WHY does THE ALL create Universes" The question may be asked in
different forms, but the above is the gist of the inquiry.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no
answer worthy of the name. Some have imagined that THE ALL had something
to gain by it, but this is absurd, for what could THE ALL gain that it
did not already possess? Others have sought the answer in the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> that
THE ALL "wished something to love" and others that it created for
pleasure, or amusement; or because it "was lonely" or to manifest its
power;--all puerile explanations and ideas, belonging to the childish
period of thought.

Others have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL found
itself "compelled" to create, by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of its own "internal
nature"--its "creative instinct." This <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is in advance of the others,
but its weak point lies in the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of THE ALL being "compelled" by
anything, internal or external. If its "internal nature," or "creative
instinct," compelled it to do anything, then the "internal nature" or
"creative instinct" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so
accordingly that part of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does
create and manifest, and seems to <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> some <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of satisfaction in so
doing. And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some
infinite degree it must have what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> correspond to an "inner nature,"
or "creative instinct," in man, with correspondingly infinite <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">Desire</span> and
Will. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not Will to
Act, unless it Desired to Act and it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">Desire</span> to Act unless it
obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> belong
to an "Inner Nature," and might be postulated as existing according to
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as
acting entirely <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">FREE</span> from any influence, internal as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as external.
That is the problem which lies at the root of difficulty--and the
difficulty that lies at the root of the problem.

Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any "Reason" whatsoever
for THE ALL to act, for a "reason" implies a "cause," and THE ALL is
above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Principle is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> into motion. So, you see, the matter is
Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL
merely "IS"--so we are compelled to say that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT
ACTS." At the last, THE ALL is All <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">Reason</span> in Itself; All <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> in Itself;
All Action in Itself--and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is
Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act--or still further, that THE
ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same
thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these present lessons,
the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL, along with its
Secret of Being. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only
to that aspect of THE ALL, which may be spoken of as "The Aspect of
BECOMING." Back of that Aspect is "The Aspect of BEING" in which all
Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE--and THE ALL;
PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, ONE AND THE SAME. Therefore,
Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile. We go into the matter
here, merely to show that we recognize the question, and also the
absurdity of the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology.

In conclusion, it may be of interest to our students to learn that while
some of the ancient, and modern, Hermetic Teachers have rather inclined
in the direction of applying the Principle of Correspondence to the
question, with the result of the "Inner Nature" conclusion,--still the
legends have it that HERMES, the Great, when asked this question by his
advanced students, answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">TOGETHER</span>
and saying not a word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then,
he may have intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: "The
lips of <span class="t7 t8 t12 hoverable">Wisdom</span> are closed, except to the ears of Understanding,"
believing that even his advanced students did not possess the
Understanding which entitled them to the Teaching. At any rate, if
Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to impart it, and so far as the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is concerned THE LIPS OF HERMES ARE CLOSED regarding it. And where
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Hermes hesitated to speak, what mortal may dare to teach?

But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if indeed
there be an answer the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> remains that:  "While All is in THE ALL, it

emphatic. And, we may add the concluding <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> of the quotation: "To him

do not allow us to enter into an extended discussion of, or explanation

give a general description of the same at this point.

At the beginning we may as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> consider the question so often asked by

The
question is generally about as follows: "Is a Plane a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> having
dimensions, or is it merely a condition or state?" We answer: "No, not a
place, nor ordinary dimension of space; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> more than a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> or

<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> or condition is a degree of dimension, in a scale subject to
measurement." Somewhat paradoxical, is it not? But let us examine the
matter. A "dimension," you know, is "a measure in a straight line,
relating to measure," etc. The ordinary dimensions of space are length,
breadth, and height, or perhaps length, breadth, height, thickness or
circumference. But there is another dimension of "created things" or
"measure in a straight line," known to occultists, and to scientists as
well, although the latter have not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> applied the term "dimension"
to it--and this new dimension, which, by the way, is the much speculated
-about "Fourth Dimension," is the standard <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in determining the
degrees or "planes."

This Fourth Dimension may be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "The Dimension of Vibration" It is a

Not only do they vibrate at different rates of motion, but as in

of the phenomena of the Universe which includes all that relates to
physics, or material things, forces, and manifestations. It includes all
forms of that which we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> Matter, and all forms of that which we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span>
Energy or Force. But you must remember that the Hermetic Philosophy does
not recognize Matter as a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> in itself, or as having a separate

certain kind. And accordingly the Hermetists classify Matter under the
<span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of Energy, and give to it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the Seven Minor Planes of the

These Seven Minor <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Planes are as follows:

    1. The Plane of Matter (A)
    2. The Plane of Matter (B)
    3. The Plane of Matter (C)
    4. The Plane of Ethereal Substance
    5. The Plane of Energy (A)
    6. The Plane of Energy (B)
    7. The Plane of Energy (C)

The Plane of Matter (A) comprises the forms of Matter in its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
solids, liquids, and gases, as generally recognized by the text-books on
physics. The Plane of Matter (B) comprises certain <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and more
subtle forms of Matter of the existence of which modern science is but
now recognizing, the phenomena of Radiant Matter, in its phases of
radium, etc., belonging to the lower sub-division of this Minor Plane.
The Plane of Matter (C) comprises forms of the most subtle and tenuous
Matter, the existence of which is not suspected by ordinary scientists.
The Plane of Ethereal Substance comprises that which science speaks of
as "The Ether", a substance of extreme tenuity and elasticity, pervading
all Universal Space, and acting as a medium for the transmission of
waves of energy, such as light, heat, electricity, etc. This Ethereal
Substance forms a connecting link between Matter (so-called) and Energy,
and partakes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of each. The Hermetic Teachings, however,
instruct that this plane has seven sub-divisions (as have all of the
Minor Planes), and that in <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> there are seven ethers, instead of but
one.

Next above the Plane of Ethereal Substance comes the Plane of Energy
(A), which comprises the ordinary forms of Energy known to science, its
seven sub-planes being, respectively, Heat; Light; Magnetism;
Electricity, and Attraction (including Gravitation, Cohesion, Chemical
Affinity, etc.) and several other forms of energy indicated by
scientific experiments but not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> named or classified. The Plane of
Energy (B) comprises seven subplanes of <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> forms of energy not as
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> discovered by science, but which have been <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "Nature's Finer
Forces" and which are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> into operation in manifestations of certain
forms of mental phenomena, and by which such phenomena becomes possible.
The Plane of Energy (C) comprises seven sub-planes of energy so highly
organized that it bears many of the characteristics of "life," but which
is not recognized by the minds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> on the ordinary plane of
development, being available for the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> on <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> of the <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span>

considered almost as "the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> power." The <span class="t0 t1 t15 t22 t25 t29 hoverable">beings</span> employing the same

Planes is more or less satisfactory and arbitrary (unless accompanied by
elaborate explanations which are foreign to the purpose of this
particular work), but we may as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> mention them. They are as follows:

units or entities, or groups and combinations of the same, which animate
the forms known to us as "minerals, chemicals, etc." These entities must
not be confounded with the molecules, atoms and corpuscles themselves,
the latter being merely the material bodies or forms of these entities,
just as a man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is but his material <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> and not "himself."

the possession of mind, soul, or life, to the mineral kingdom, but all
occultists recognize the existence of the same, and modern science is
rapidly moving forward to the point-of-view of the Hermetic, in this
respect. The molecules, atoms and corpuscles have their "loves and
hates"; "likes and dislikes"; "attractions and repulsions". "affinities
and non-affinities," etc., and some of the more daring of modern
scientific minds have expressed the opinion that the <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> and will,
emotions and feelings, of the atoms differ only in degree from those of
men. We have no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> or space to argue this matter here. All occultists
know it to be a fact, and others are referred to some of the more recent

sub-divisions to this plane.

degree of mental and vital development of a class of entities unknown to
the average man, but recognized to occultists. They are invisible to the
ordinary senses of man, but, nevertheless, exist and play their part of
the Drama of the Universe. Their degree of <span class="t5 t15 t21 t27 hoverable">intelligence</span> is between that
of the mineral and chemical entities on the one hand, and of the
entities of the plant kingdom on the other. There are seven subdivisions
to this plane, also.

The Plane of Animal Mind, in its seven sub-divisions, comprises the
states and conditions of the entities, beings, or souls, animating the
animal forms of life, familiar to us all. It is not necessary to go into
details regarding this kingdom or plane of life, for the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is

and beyond. But, remember, that there have been races before us which
have passed through these degrees, and then on to <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes. Our own
race is the fifth (with stragglers from the fourth) which has <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> foot

who have outstripped the masses, and who have passed on to the sixth and
seventh sub-division, and some few being still further on. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> of
the Sixth Sub-Division will be "The Super-Man"; he of the Seventh will
be "The Over-Man."

In our consideration of the Seven Minor Mental Planes, we have merely
referred to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span> Elementary Planes in a general way. We do not wish
to go into this subject in detail in this work, for it does not belong
to this part of the general philosophy and teachings. But we may say
this much, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to give you a little clearer idea, of the relations
of these planes to the more familiar ones--the Elementary Planes bear
the same relation to the Planes of Mineral, Plant, Animal and <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Human</span>
Mentality and Life, that the black keys on the piano do to the white
keys. The white keys are sufficient to produce music, but there are
certain scales, melodies, and harmonies, in which the black keys play
their part, and in which their presence is necessary. They are also
necessary as "connecting links" of soul-condition; entity states, etc.,
between the several other planes, certain forms of development being
attained therein--this last <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> giving to the reader who can "read
between the lines" a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the processes of Evolution, and a

occultists, and the esoteric writings are <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of mention of them.  The
readers of Bulwer's "Sanoni" and similar tales will recognize the
entities inhabiting these planes of life.

All that we can say is that the Seven Minor Planes of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span>

ours, that we cannot even think of the details of the same; their minds
so far transcend ours, that to them we scarcely seem to "think," and our
mental processes seem almost akin to material processes; the Matter of

some are even said to be "clothed in Pure Energy." What may be said of
such Beings?

have foregone the ecstasy of Absorption by THE ALL, in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to help the

Only the most advanced Hermetists are able to grasp the Inner Teachings
regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of existence, and the powers manifested on the

regarding these <span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spiritual</span> Planes. And much of these Inner Teachings is
held by the Hermetists as being too sacred, important and even dangerous
for general public dissemination. The intelligent student may recognize
what we mean by this when we <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> of "Spirit" as <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span>
by the Hermetists is akin to "Living Power"; "Animated Force;" "Inner

with that usually and commonly employed in connection with the term,
i.e., "religious; ecclesiastical; spiritual; ethereal; holy," etc., etc.
To occultists the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Spirit" is <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of "The Animating

for them, and the swing of the pendulum of Rhythm will inevitably swing
them back to the furthest extreme of Material existence, from which

them a lingering memory of the heights from which they fell owing to
their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> actions. The legends of the Fallen Angels have a basis in
actual facts, as all advanced occultists know. The striving for selfish

previously risen. But to even such a soul, the opportunity of a return
is given--and such souls make the return journey, paying the terrible
penalty according to the invariable Law.

In conclusion we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> again remind you that according to the Principle
of Correspondence, which embodies the truth: "As Above so Below; as
Below, so Above," all of the Seven Hermetic Principles are in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span>
operation on all of the many planes, <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Mental and Spiritual. The
Principle of Mental Substance of course applies to all the planes, for
all are held in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> of THE ALL. The Principle of Correspondence
manifests in all, for there is a correspondence, harmony and agreement
between the several planes. The Principle of Vibration manifests on all
planes, in <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> the very differences that go to make the "planes" arise
from Vibration, as we have explained. The Principle of Polarity
manifests on each plane, the extremes of the Poles being apparently
opposite and contradictory. The Principle of Rhythm manifests on each
Plane, the movement of the phenomena having its ebb and flow, rise and
flow, incoming and outgoing. The Principle of Cause and Effect manifests
on each Plane, every Effect having its Cause and every Cause having its
effect. The Principle of Gender manifests on each Plane, the Creative
Energy being always manifest, and operating along the lines of its
Masculine and Feminine Aspects.

"As Above so Below; as Below, so Above." This centuries old Hermetic
axiom embodies one of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Principles of Universal Phenomena. As we
proceed with our consideration of the remaining Principles, we will see
even more clearly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of the universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

VIBRATION

    "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything
    vibrates."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t26 hoverable">Third</span> Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Vibration--embodies
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that Motion is manifest in everything in the Universe--that
nothing is at rest--that everything moves, vibrates, and circles. This
Hermetic Principle was recognized by some of the early Greek philosophers
who embodied it in their systems. But, then, for centuries it was lost
sight of by the thinkers outside of the Hermetic ranks. But in the
Nineteenth Century <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> science re-discovered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> and the
Twentieth Century scientific discoveries have added additional proof of
the correctness and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> of this centuries-old Hermetic doctrine.

The Hermetic Teachings are that not only is everything in constant
movement and vibration, but that the "differences" between the various
manifestations of the universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> are due entirely to the varying
rate and mode of vibrations. Not only this, but that even THE ALL, in
itself, manifests a constant vibration of such an infinite degree of
intensity and rapid motion that it may be practically considered as at
rest, the teachers directing the attention of the students to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
that even on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> plane a rapidly moving <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> (such as a
revolving wheel) seems to be at rest. The Teachings are to the effect
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> is at one end of the Pole of Vibration, the other Pole being
certain extremely gross forms of Matter. Between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles are
millions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> millions of different rates and modes of vibration.

Modern Science has proven that all that we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> Matter and Energy are
but "modes of vibratory motion," and some of the more advanced
scientists are rapidly moving toward the positions of the occultists who
hold that the phenomena of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> are likewise modes of vibration or
motion. Let us see what science has to say regarding the question of
vibrations in matter and energy.

In the first place, science teaches that all matter manifests, in some
degree, the vibrations arising from temperature or heat. Be an <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span>
cold or hot--both being but degrees of the same things--it manifests
certain heat vibrations, and in that <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> is in motion and vibration.
Then all particles of Matter are in circular movement, from corpuscle to
suns. The planets revolve around suns, and many of them turn on their
axes. The suns move around greater central points, and these are
believed to move around still greater, and so on, ad infinitum. The
molecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of constant vibration and movement around each other and against
each other. The molecules are composed of Atoms, which, likewise, are in
a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of constant movement and vibration. The atoms are composed of
Corpuscles, sometimes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "electrons," "ions," etc., which also are
in a <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which
manifest a very rapid <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> and mode of vibration. And, so we see that
all forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic
Principle of Vibration.

And so it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that
Light, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion
connected in some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with, and probably emanating from the Ether.
Science does not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> attempt to explain the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the phenomena
known as Cohesion, which is the principle of Molecular Attraction; nor
Chemical Affinity, which is the principle of Atomic Attraction; nor
Gravitation (the greatest mystery of the three), which is the principle
of attraction by which every particle or mass of Matter is bound to
every other particle or mass. These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> forms of Energy are not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span>
understood by science, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the writers incline to the opinion that these
too are manifestations of some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of vibratory energy, a <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> which
the Hermetists have held and taught for ages past.

The Universal Ether, which is postulated by science <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
being understood clearly, is held by the Hermetists to be but a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span>
manifestation of that which is erroneously <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> matter--that is to
say, Matter at a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of vibration--and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> by them "The
Ethereal Substance." The Hermetists teach that this Ethereal Substance
is of extreme tenuity and elasticity, and pervades universal space,
serving as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such
as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc. The Teachings are that The
Ethereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory
energy known as "Matter" on the one hand, and "Energy or Force" on the
other; and also that it manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and
mode, entirely its own.

Scientists have offered the illustration of a rapidly moving wheel, top,
or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration. The
illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a
low rate of speed--we will <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> this revolving <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> "the object" in
following out the illustration. Let us suppose the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> moving slowly.
It may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.
The speed is gradually increased. In a few moments its movement becomes
so rapid that a deep growl or low <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> may be heard. Then as the rate is
increased the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> rises one in the musical scale. Then, the motion
being still further increased, the next <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> is distinguished.
Then, one after another, all the notes of the musical scale appear,
rising <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> as the motion is increased. Finally when the
motions have reached a certain rate the final <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">note</span> perceptible to <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span>
ears is reached and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence
follows. No sound is <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t18 hoverable">heard</span> from the revolving object, the rate of motion
being so <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> that the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> ear cannot register the vibrations. Then
comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. Then after quite a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
the eye catches a glimpse of the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> becoming a dull dark reddish
color. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter. Then as the
speed is increased, the red melts into an orange. Then the orange melts
into a yellow. Then follow, successively, the shades of green, blue,
indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of sped increases. Then the
violet shades away, and all color disappears, the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> eye not
being able to register them. But there are invisible rays emanating from
the revolving object, the rays that are <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> in photographing, and other
subtle rays of light. Then begin to manifest the peculiar rays known as
the "X Rays," etc., as the constitution of the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> changes.
Electricity and Magnetism are emitted when the appropriate rate of
vibration is attained.

When the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> reaches a certain rate of vibration its molecules
disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the original elements or
atoms. Then the atoms, following the Principle of Vibration, are
separated into the countless corpuscles of which they are composed. And
finally, even the corpuscles disappear and the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> may be said to Be
composed of The Ethereal Substance. Science does not dare to follow the
illustration further, but the Hermetists teach that if the vibrations be
continually increased the <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> mount up the successive states of
manifestation and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> in turn manifest the various mental stages, and
then on Spiritward, until it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> finally re-enter THE ALL, which is
Absolute Spirit. The "object," however, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have ceased to be an
"object" <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> before the stage of Ethereal Substance was reached, but
otherwise the illustration is correct inasmuch as it shows the effect of
constantly increased rates and modes of vibration. It must be
remembered, in the above illustration, that at the stages at which the
"object" throws off vibrations of light, heat, etc., it is not actually
"resolved" into those forms of energy (which are much <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the
scale), but simply that it reaches a degree of vibration in which those
forms of energy are liberated, in a degree, from the confining
influences of its molecules, atoms and corpuscles, as the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> may be.
These forms of energy, although much <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale than matter,
are imprisoned and confined in the material combinations, by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of
the energies manifesting through, and using material forms, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>
becoming entangled and confined in their creations of material forms,
which, to an extent, is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> of all creations, the creating force
becoming involved in its creation.

But the Hermetic Teachings go much further than do those of modern
science. They teach that all manifestation of thought, emotion, reason,
will or desire, or any mental <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> or condition, are accompanied by
vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect
the minds of other persons by "induction." This is the principle which
produces the phenomena of "telepathy"; mental influence, and other forms
of the action and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> over mind, with which the general public
is rapidly becoming acquainted, owing to the wide dissemination of
occult <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> by the various schools, cults and teachers along these
lines at this time.

Every thought, emotion or mental <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> has its corresponding rate and
mode of vibration. And by an effort of the will of the person, or of
other persons, these mental states may be reproduced, just as a musical
tone may be reproduced by causing an instrument to vibrate at a certain
rate--just as color may be reproduced in the same may. By a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of
the Principle of Vibration, as applied to Mental Phenomena, one may
polarize his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> at any degree he wishes, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> gaining a perfect
control over his mental states, moods, etc. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> he may
affect the minds of others, producing the desired mental states in them.
In short, he may be able to produce on the Mental Plane that which
science produces on the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane--namely, "Vibrations at Will."
This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of course may be acquired only by the proper instruction,
exercises, practice, etc., the science being that of Mental
Transmutation, one of the branches of the Hermetic Art.

A little reflection on what we have said will show the student that the
Principle of Vibration underlies the wonderful phenomena of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>
manifested by the Masters and Adepts, who are able to apparently <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span>
aside the Laws of Nature, but who, in reality, are simply using one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span>
against another; one principle against others; and who accomplish their
results by changing the vibrations of material objects, or forms of
energy, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> perform what are commonly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "miracles."

As one of the old Hermetic writers has truly said: "He who understands
the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of Power."

POLARITY

    "Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything
    has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same;
    opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree;
    extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes
    may be reconciled."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Fourth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Polarity embodies

"two poles"; a "pair of opposites," with manifold degrees between the

The old paradoxes, which have ever perplexed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of
men, are explained by an understanding of this Principle. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has always
recognized something akin to this Principle, and has endeavored to
express it by such sayings, maxims and aphorisms as the following:
"Everything is and isn't, at the same time"; "all truths are but
half-truths"; "every <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is half-false"; "there are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sides to
everything"--"there is a reverse side to every shield," etc., etc.

The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter
of degree. It teaches that "the pairs of opposites may be reconciled,"
and that "thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but different
in degree"; and that the "universal reconciliation of opposites" is
effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. The teachers
claim that illustrations of this Principle may be had on every hand, and
from an examination into the real <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of anything. They begin by
showing that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> and Matter are but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of the same thing,
the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. They show
that THE ALL and The Many are the same, the difference being merely a
matter of degree of Mental Manifestation. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">LAW</span> and Laws are the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> opposite poles of one thing. Likewise, PRINCIPLE and Principles.
Infinite <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> and finite minds.

Then passing on to the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, they illustrate the Principle by
showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences
being merely a matter of degrees. The thermometer shows many degrees of
temperature, the lowest pole being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "cold," and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span>
"heat." Between these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles are many degrees of "heat" or "cold,"
<span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> them either and you are equally correct. The <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> degrees
is always "warmer," while the lower is always "colder." There is no
absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> on the
thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins. It is all a matter of
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> or lower vibrations. The very terms "high" and "low," which we
are compelled to use, are but poles of the same thing-the terms are
relative. So with "East and West"--travel around the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> in an
eastward direction, and you reach a point which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> west at your
starting point, and you return from that westward point. Travel far
enough North, and you will <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> yourself traveling South, or vice versa.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> and Darkness are poles of the same thing, with many degrees
between them. The musical scale is the same--starting with "C" you move
upward until you reach another "C" and so on, the differences between
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> ends of the board being the same, with many degrees between the

being the only difference between <span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> violet and low red. Large and
Small are relative. So are Noise and Quiet; Hard and Soft follow the
rule. Likewise Sharp and Dull. Positive and Negative are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of
the same thing, with countless degrees between them.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and Bad are not absolute--we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> one end of the scale <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and the
other Bad, or one end <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> and the other Evil, according to the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of
the terms. A <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> is "less good" than the <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> in the scale;
but that "less good" thing, in turn, is "more good" than the <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> next
below it--and so on, the "more or less" being regulated by the position
on the scale.

And so it is on the Mental Plane. "Love and. Hate" are generally
regarded as being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> diametrically opposed to each other; entirely
different; unreconcilable. But we apply the Principle of Polarity; we
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> that there is no such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as Absolute <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> or Absolute Hate, as
distinguished from each other. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are merely terms applied to the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of the same thing. Beginning at any point of the scale we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span>
"more love," or "less hate," as we ascend the scale; and "more hate" or
"less love" as we descend this being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> no matter from what point,
<span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> or low, we may start. There are degrees of <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> and Hate, and there
is a middle point where "Like and Dislike" become so faint that it is
difficult to distinguish between them. Courage and <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">Fear</span> come under the
same rule. The Pairs of Opposites exist everywhere. Where you <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> one
<span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> you <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> its opposite-the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles.

And it is this <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that enables the Hermetist to transmute one mental
<span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> into another, along the lines of Polarization. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Things</span> belonging to
different classes cannot be transmuted into each other, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of
the same class may be changed, that is, may have their polarity changed.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> never becomes East or West, or Red or Violet-but it may and
often does turn into Hate and likewise Hate may be transformed into
Love, by changing its polarity. Courage may be transmuted into Fear, and
the reverse. Hard <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> may be rendered Soft. Dull <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> become Sharp.

between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of the same <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of different degrees. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Take</span> the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> of a
Fearful man. By raising his mental vibrations along the line of Fear-
Courage, he can be filled with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> degree of Courage and
Fearlessness. And, likewise, the Slothful <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may change himself into an
Active, Energetic <span class="t22 t25 hoverable">individual</span> simply by polarizing along the lines of the
desired quality.

The student who is familiar with the processes by which the various
schools of Mental Science, etc., produce changes in the mental states of
those following their teachings, may not readily understand the
principle underlying many of these changes. When, however, the Principle
of Polarity is once grasped, and it is seen that the mental changes are
occasioned by a change of polarity-a sliding along the same scale-the
hatter is readily understood. The change is not in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of a
transmutation of one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> into another <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> entirely different-but is
merely a change of degree in the same things, a vastly important
difference. For instance, borrowing an analogy from the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane,
it is impossible to change Heat into Sharpness, Loudness, Highness,
etc., but Heat may readily be transmuted into Cold, simply by lowering
the vibrations. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Hate and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> are mutually transmutable;
so are <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">Fear</span> and Courage. But <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">Fear</span> cannot be transformed into Love, nor
can Courage be transmuted into Hate. The mental states belong to
innumerable classes, each class of which has its opposite poles, along
which transmutation is possible.

The student will readily recognize that in the mental states, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as
in the phenomena of the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles may be classified
as Positive and Negative, respectively. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t20 t24 t27 t28 hoverable">Love</span> is Positive to Hate;
Courage to Fear; Activity to Non-Activity, etc., etc. And it will also
be noticed that even to those unfamiliar with the Principle of
Vibration, the Positive pole seems to be of a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree than the
Negative, and readily dominates it. The tendency of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Nature</span> is in the
direction of the dominant activity of the Positive pole.

In addition to the changing of the poles of one's own mental states by
the operation of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of Polarization, the phenomena of Mental
Influence, in its manifold phases, shows us that the principle may be
extended so as to embrace the phenomena of the influence of one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
over that of another, of which so much has been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> and taught of
late years. When it is understood that Mental Induction is possible,
that is that mental states may be produced by "induction" from others,
then we can readily see how a certain rate of vibration, or polarization
of a certain mental state, may be communicated to another person, and
his polarity in that class of mental states <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> changed. It is along
this principle that the results of many of the "mental treatments" are
obtained. For instance, a <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is "blue," melancholy and <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> of fear.
A mental scientist bringing his own <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> up to the desired vibration by
his trained will, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> obtaining the desired polarization in his own
case, then produces a similar mental <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> in the other by induction,
the result being that the vibrations are raised and the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> polarizes
toward the Positive end of the scale instead toward the Negative, and
his <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">Fear</span> and other negative emotions are transmuted to Courage and
similar positive mental states. A little study will show you that these
mental changes are nearly all along the line of Polarization, the change
being one of degree rather than of kind.

enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those
of other people. He will see that these states are all matters of
degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration
at will--to change his mental poles, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> of his mental
states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span>
he will be able to aid his fellows intelligently and by the appropriate
methods change the polarity when the same is desirable. We advise all
students to familiarize themselves with this Principle of Polarity, for
a correct understanding of the same will throw <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on many difficult

RHYTHM

    "Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides;

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Fifth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Rhythm-embodies the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that in everything there is manifested a measured motion; a
to-and-from movement; a flow and inflow; a swing forward and backward; a
pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and a low-
tide; between the two-poles manifest on the physical, mental or
<span class="t0 t4 t6 t7 t8 t11 t14 t16 t17 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">spiritual</span> planes. The Principle of rhythm is closely connected with the
Principle of Polarity described in the preceding chapter. Rhythm
manifests between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles established by the Principle of
Polarity. This does not mean, however, that the pendulum of Rhythm
swings to the extreme poles, for this rarely happens; in fact, it is
difficult to establish the extreme polar opposites in the majority of
cases. But the swing is ever "toward" first one pole and then the other.

There is always an action and reaction; an advance and a retreat; a
rising and a sinking; manifested in all of the airs and phenomena of the
Universe. Suns, worlds, men, animals, plants, minerals, forces, energy,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and matter, yes, even Spirit, manifests this Principle. The
Principle manifests in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and destruction of worlds; in the
rise and fall of nations; in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> history of all things; and finally
in the mental states of Man.

Beginning with the manifestations of Spirit--of THE ALL--it will be
noticed that there is ever the Outpouring and the Indrawing; the
"Outbreathing and Inbreathing of Brahm," as the Brahmans <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> it.
Universes are created; reach their extreme low point of materiality; and
then begin in their upward swing. Suns spring into being, and then their
height of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> being reached, the process of retrogression begins, and
after aeons they become dead masses of matter, awaiting another impulse
which starts again their inner energies into activity and a new solar

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is with all the worlds; they are born,
grow and die; only to be reborn. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> it is with all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of
shape and form; they swing from action to reaction; from birth to death;
from activity to inactivity--and then back again. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> it is with all
living things; they are born, grow, and die--and then are reborn. So it
is with all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> movements, philosophies, creeds, fashions,
governments, nations, and all else-birth, growth, maturity, decadence,
death-and then new-birth. The swing of the pendulum is ever in evidence.

Night follows day; and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> night. The pendulum swings from Summer to
Winter, and then back again. The corpuscles, atoms, molecules, and all
masses of matter, swing around the circle of their nature. There is no
such <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as absolute rest, or cessation from movement, and all
movement partakes of rhythm. The principle is of universal application.
It may be applied to any question, or phenomena of any of the many
planes of life. It may be applied to all phases of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> activity.
There is always the Rhythmic swing from one pole to the other. The
Universal Pendulum is ever in motion. The Tides of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Life</span> flow in and out,
according to Law.

The Principle of rhythm is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> understood by modern science, and is
considered a universal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> as applied to material things. But the
Hermetists carry the principle much further, and know that its
manifestations and influence extend to the mental activities of Man, and
that it accounts for the bewildering succession of moods, feelings and
other annoying and perplexing changes that we notice in ourselves. But
the Hermetists by studying the operations of this Principle have learned
to escape some of its activities by Transmutation.

The Hermetic Masters <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> since discovered that while the Principle of
Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still
there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena
are concerned. They discovered that there were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> general planes of
Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span>
enabled them to rise to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> escape the swing of
the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other
words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and
the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">Consciousness</span> was not affected. This they <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of
Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above
the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the
negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> and
letting it <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student,
polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to
"refusing" to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a
"denial" of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized
position, and allows the mental pendulum to swing back along the
unconscious plane. All individuals who have attained any degree of self-
mastery, accomplish this, more or less unknowingly, and by refusing to
allow their moods and negative mental states to affect them, they apply
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Neutralization. The Master, however, carries this to a much
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> degree of proficiency, and by the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of his Will he attains
a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the
part of those who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by
the mental pendulum of moods and feelings.

The importance of this will be appreciated by any thinking <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> who
realizes what creatures of moods, feelings and emotion the majority of
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are, and how little mastery of themselves they manifest. If you
will stop and consider a moment, you will realize how much these swings
of Rhythm have affected you in your life--how a period of Enthusiasm has
been invariably followed by an opposite feeling and mood of Depression.
Likewise, your moods and periods of Courage have been succeeded by equal
moods of Fear. And so it has ever been with the majority of
persons--tides of feeling have ever risen and fallen with them, but they
have never suspected the cause or <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of the mental phenomena. An
understanding of the workings of this Principle will give one the key to
the Mastery of these rhythmic swings of feeling, and will enable him to
know himself better and to avoid being carried away by these inflows and
outflows. The Will is superior to the conscious manifestation of this
Principle, although the Principle itself can never be destroyed. We may
escape its effects, but the Principle operates, nevertheless. The
pendulum ever swings, although we may escape being carried along with
it.

There are other features of the operation of this Principle of Rhythm of
which we wish to <span class="t6 t9 t11 t19 t20 t22 hoverable">speak</span> at this point. There comes into its operations
that which is known as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation. One of the definitions
or meanings of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Compensate" is, "to counterbalance" which is
the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> in which the Hermetists <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the term. It is this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of
Compensation to which the Kybalion refers when it says: "The measure of
the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm
compensates."

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation is that the swing in one direction determines
the swing in the opposite direction, or to the opposite pole-the one
balances, or counterbalances, the other. On the <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane we see
many examples of this Law. The pendulum of the clock swings a certain
distance to the right, and then an equal distance to the left. The
seasons balance each other in the same way. The tides follow the same
Law. And the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is manifested in all the phenomena of Rhythm. The
pendulum, with a short swing in one direction, has but a short swing in
the other; while the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> swing to the right invariably means the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span>
swing to the left.  An <span class="t24 t25 hoverable">object</span> hurled upward to a certain height has an
equal distance to traverse on its return. The force with which a
projectile is sent upward a mile is reproduced when the projectile
returns to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> on its return journey. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> is constant on the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, as reference to the standard authorities will show you.

But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man's
mental states are subject to the same Law. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who enjoys keenly, is
subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable
of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and
enjoys but little--he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are
other animals who enjoy keenly, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">whose</span> nervous organism and
temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is
with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of
enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others
which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense
suffering. The rule is that the capacity for pain and pleasure, in each
individual, are balanced. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation is in <span class="t10 t16 hoverable">full</span> operation
here.

But the Hermetists go still further in this matter. They teach that
before one is able to enjoy a certain degree of pleasure, he must have
swung as far, proportionately, toward the other pole of feeling. They
hold, however, that the Negative is precedent to the Positive in this
matter, that is to say that in experiencing a certain degree of pleasure
it does not follow that he will have to "pay up for it" with a
corresponding degree of pain; on the contrary, the pleasure is the
Rhythmic swing, according to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation, for a degree of
pain previously experienced either in the present life, or in a previous
incarnation. This throws a new <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> on the Problem of Pain.

Neutralization before mentioned. By rising on to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of the

plane is avoided and escaped.

anything he possesses or lacks. If he has one thing, he lacks
another--the balance is struck. No one can "keep his penny and have the

millionaire may have the inclination toward feasting, and the wealth
wherewith to secure all the dainties and luxuries of the table, while he
lacks the appetite to enjoy the same; he envies the appetite and

millionaire, and who gets more pleasure from his plain <span class="t0 t14 t23 t24 hoverable">food</span> than the
millionaire could obtain even if his appetite were not jaded, nor his

it is through life. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Compensation is ever in operation,

The Principle of Cause and Effect underlies all scientific thought,
<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> and modern, and was enunciated by the Hermetic Teachers in the
earliest days. While many and varied disputes between the many schools
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> have since arisen, these disputes have been principally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
the details of the operations of the Principle, and still more often

The underlying Principle of Cause and
Effect has been accepted as correct by practically all the thinkers of
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> worthy of the name.

phenomena of the universe from the domain of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> and Order, and to
relegate it; to the control of the imaginary something which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> have

A little consideration will show anyone that there is in reality no such
<span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as pure chance. Webster defines the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Chance" as follows: "A
supposed agent or mode of activity other than a force, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> or purpose;
the operation or activity of such agent; the supposed effect of such an
agent; a happening; fortuity; casualty, etc." But a little consideration
will show you that there can be no such agent as "Chance," in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span>
of something outside of Law-something outside of Cause and Effect. How
could there be a something acting in the phenomenal universe,
independent of the laws, order, and continuity of the latter? Such a
something <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be entirely independent of the orderly trend of the
universe, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> superior to it. We can imagine nothing outside
of THE ALL being outside of the Law, and that only because THE ALL is
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">LAW</span> in itself. There is no room in the universe for a something
outside of and independent of Law. The existence of such a Something

into chaotic disorder and lawlessness.

A careful examination will show that what we <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> "Chance" is merely an
expression relating to obscure causes; causes that we cannot perceive;
causes that we cannot understand. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Chance is derived from a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Meaning</span> "to fall" (as the falling of dice), the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> being that the fall
of the dice (and many other happenings) are merely a "happening"
unrelated to any cause. And this is the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> in which the term is
generally employed. But when the matter is closely examined, it is seen
that there is no chance whatsoever about the fall of the dice. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>
a die falls, and displays a certain number, it obeys a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> as infallible
as that which governs the revolution of the planets around the sun. Back
of the fall of the die are causes, or chains of causes, running back
further than the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> can follow. The position of the die in the box;
the amount of muscular energy expended in the throw; the condition of
the table, etc., etc., all are causes, the effect of which may be seen.
But back of these seen causes there are chains of unseen preceding
causes, all of which had a bearing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of the die which fell
uppermost.

If a die be cast a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of times, it will be found that the
numbers shown will be about equal, that is, there will be an equal
<span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of one-spot, two-spot, etc., coming uppermost. Toss a penny in
the air, and it may come down either "heads" or "tails"; but make a
sufficient <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of tosses, and the heads and tails will about even up.
This is the operation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> of average. But both the average and
the single toss come under the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Cause and Effect, and if we were
able to examine into the preceding causes, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be clearly seen that
it was simply impossible for the die to fall other than it did, under
the same circumstances and at the same time. Given the same causes, the
same results will follow. There is always a "cause" and a "because" to
every event. Nothing ever "happens" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a cause, or rather a chain
of causes.

Some confusion has arisen in the minds of persons considering this
Principle, from the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that they were unable to explain how one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span>
could cause another thing--that is, be the "creator" of the <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span>
thing. As a matter of fact, no "thing" ever causes or "creates" another
"thing." Cause and Effect deals merely with "events." An "event" is
"that which comes, arrives or happens, as a result or consequent of some
preceding event." No event "creates" another event, but is merely a
preceding link in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> orderly chain of events flowing from the
creative energy of THE ALL. There is a continuity between all events
precedent, consequent and subsequent. There is a relation existing
between everything that has gone before, and everything that follows. A
stone is dislodged from a mountain side and crashes through a roof of a
cottage in the valley below. At first sight we regard this as a chance
effect, but when we examine the matter we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> chain of causes
behind it. In the first <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> there was the rain which softened the

that was the influence of the sun, other rains, etc., which gradually
disintegrated the piece of rock from a larger piece; then there were the
causes which led to the formation of the mountain, and its upheaval by
convulsions of nature, and so on ad infinitum. Then we might follow up
the causes behind the rain, etc. Then we might consider the existence of
the roof In short, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> ourselves involved in a mesh of
cause and effect, from which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> soon strive to extricate

Just as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parents, and four grandparents, and eight
great-grandparents, and sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on
until when, say, forty generations are calculated the numbers of
ancestors run into many millions--so it is with the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of causes
behind even the most trifling event or phenomena, such as the <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> of
a tiny speck of soot before your eye. It is not an easy matter to trace
the bit of soot hack to the early period of the world's history when it
formed a part of a massive tree-trunk, which was afterward converted
into coal, and so on, until as the speck of soot it now passes before
your vision on its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to other adventures. And a mighty chain of
events, causes and effects, <span class="t1 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t13 t15 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t27 t29 hoverable">brought</span> it to its present condition, and the
later is but one of the chain of events which will go to produce other
events hundreds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> from now. One of the series of events arising
from the tiny bit of soot was the writing of these lines, which caused
the typesetter to perform certain work; the proofreader to do likewise;
and which will arouse certain thoughts in your mind, and that of others,
which in turn will affect others, and so on, and on, and on, beyond the
ability of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> to think further-and all from the <span class="t28 hoverable">passage</span> of a tiny bit
of soot, all of which shows the relativity and association of things,
and the further <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that "there is no great; there is no small, in the

We do not wish to enter into a consideration of <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">Free</span> Will, or
Determinism, in this work, for various reasons. Among the many reasons,
is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely
right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic
Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths
the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> may be both

<span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> writers express the matter thus: "The further the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> is
from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches,
the nearer <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">Free</span> is it."

The majority of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are more or less the slaves of heredity,
environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by
the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by
their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy
of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying, "Why, I
certainly am <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> to act and do as I please--I do just what I want to
do," but they fail to explain whence arise the "want to" and "as I
please." What makes them "want to" do one <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> in preference to
another; what makes them "please" to do this, and not do that? Is there
no "because" to their "pleasing" and "Wanting"? The <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> can change
these "pleases" and "wants" into others at the opposite end of the
mental pole. He is able to "Will to will," instead of to will because
some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a
tendency or <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him so to do.

like the pawns on the checkerboard of life, they play their parts and
are laid aside after the game is over. But the Masters, knowing the
rules of the game, rise above the plane of material life, and placing
themselves in touch with the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> powers of their nature, dominate
their own moods, characters, qualities, and polarity, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the

GENDER

    "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine
    and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all
    planes."--The Kybalion.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Seventh Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Gender-embodies
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> that there is Gender manifested in everything-that the
Masculine and Feminine principles are ever present and active in all
phases of phenomena, on each and every plane of life. At this point we
think it <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> your attention to the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that Gender, in its
Hermetic sense, and Sex in the ordinarily accepted <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of the term, are
not the same.

The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Gender" is derived from the Latin root <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> "to beget; to
procreate; to generate; to create; to produce." A moment's consideration
will show you that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> has a much broader and more general <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span>
than the term "Sex," the latter referring to the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> distinctions
between male and female living things. Sex is merely a manifestation of
Gender on a certain plane of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane--the plane of
organic life. We wish to impress this distinction <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> your minds, for
the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that certain writers, who have acquired a smattering of the
Hermetic Philosophy, have sought to identify this Seventh Hermetic
Principle with wild and fanciful, and often reprehensible, theories and
teachings regarding Sex.

The office of Gender is solely that of creating, producing, generating,
etc., and its manifestations are visible on every plane of phenomena. It
is somewhat difficult to produce proofs of this along scientific lines,
for the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that science has not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> recognized this Principle as
of universal application. But still some proofs are forthcoming from
scientific sources. In the first place, we <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> a distinct manifestation
of the Principle of Gender among the corpuscles, ions, or electrons,
which constitute the basis of Matter as science now knows the latter,
and which by forming certain combinations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the Atom, which until
lately was regarded as final and indivisible.

The latest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> of science is that the atom is composed of a multitude
of corpuscles, electrons, or ions (the various names being applied by
different authorities) revolving around each other and vibrating at a
<span class="t17 t29 hoverable">high</span> degree and intensity. But the accompanying statement is made that
the formation of the atom is really due to the clustering of negative
corpuscles around a positive one---the positive corpuscles seeming to
exert a certain influence <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the negative corpuscles, causing the
latter to assume certain combinations and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> "create" or "generate" an
atom. This is in line with the most <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Hermetic Teachings, which
have always identified the Masculine principle of Gender with the
"Positive," and the Feminine with the "Negative" Poles of Electricity
(so called).

Now a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> at this point regarding this identification. The public <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span>
has formed an entirely erroneous impression regarding the qualities of
the so-called "Negative" pole of electrified or magnetized Matter. The
terms Positive and Negative are very wrongly applied to this phenomenon
by science. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Positive means something real and strong, as
compared with a Negative unreality or weakness. Nothing is further from
the real facts of electrical phenomenon. The so-called Negative pole of
the battery is really the pole in and by which the generation or
production of new forms and energies is manifested. There is nothing
"negative" about it. The best scientific authorities now <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
"Cathode" in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of "Negative," the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> Cathode coming from the Greek
root <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">meaning</span> "descent; the path of generation, etc," From the Cathode
pole emerge the swarm of electrons or corpuscles; from the same pole
emerge those wonderful "rays" which have revolutionized scientific
conceptions during the past decade. The Cathode pole is the Mother of
all of the strange phenomena which have rendered useless the old
textbooks, and which have caused many <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> accepted theories to be
relegated to the scrap-pile of scientific speculation. The Cathode, or
Negative Pole, is the Mother Principle of Electrical Phenomena, and of
the finest forms of matter as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> known to science. So you see we are
justified in refusing to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the term "Negative" in our consideration of
the subject, and in insisting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> substituting the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span> "Feminine" for
the old term. The facts of the <span class="t5 t16 t21 t24 t25 hoverable">case</span> bear us out in this, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> taking
the Hermetic Teachings into consideration. And so we shall <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">word</span>
"Feminine" in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of "Negative" in speaking of that pole of
activity.

The latest scientific teachings are that the creative corpuscles or
electrons are Feminine (science says "they are composed of negative
electricity"-we say they are composed of Feminine energy). A Feminine
corpuscle becomes detached from, or rather leaves, a Masculine
corpuscle, and starts on a new career. It actively seeks a union with a
Masculine corpuscle, being urged thereto by the natural impulse to
create new forms of Matter or Energy. One writer goes so far as to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
the term "it at once seeks, of its own volition, a union," etc. This
detachment and uniting <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> the basis of the greater part of the
activities of the chemical world. When the Feminine corpuscle unites
with a Masculine corpuscle, a certain process is begun. The Feminine
particles vibrate rapidly under the influence of the Masculine energy,
and circle rapidly around the latter. The result is the birth of a new
atom. This new atom is really composed of a union of the Masculine and
Feminine electrons, or corpuscles, but when the union is formed the atom
is a separate thing, having certain properties, but no longer
manifesting the property of <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> electricity. The process of detachment
or separation of the Feminine electrons is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> "ionization." These
electrons, or corpuscles, are the most active workers in Nature's field.
Arising from their unions, or combinations, manifest the varied
phenomena of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, attraction,
repulsion, chemical affinity and the reverse, and similar phenomena. And
all this arises from the operation of the Principle of Gender on the
plane of Energy.

The part of the Masculine principle seems to be that of directing a
certain inherent energy toward the Feminine principle, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> starting
into activity the creative processes. But the Feminine principle is the
one always doing the active creative work-and this is so on all planes.
And yet, each principle is incapable of operative energy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the
assistance of the other. In some of the forms of life, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
principles are combined in one organism. For that matter, everything in
the organic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> manifests both genders--there is always the Masculine
present in the Feminine form, and the Feminine form.  The Hermetic
Teachings include much regarding the operation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> principles of
Gender in the production and manifestation of various forms of energy,
etc., but we do not deem it expedient to go into detail regarding the
same at this point, because we are unable to back up the same with
scientific proof, for the <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> that science has not as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> progressed
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> far. But the example we have given you of the phenomena of the
electrons or corpuscles will show you that science is on the right path,
and will also give you a general <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of the underlying principles.

Some leading scientific investigators have announced their belief that
in the formation of crystals there was to be found something that
corresponded to "sex-activity" which is another straw showing the
direction the scientific winds are blowing. And each year will <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span>
other facts to corroborate the correctness of the Hermetic Principle of
Gender. It will be found that Gender is in constant operation and
manifestation in the field of inorganic matter, and in the field of
Energy or Force. Electricity is now generally regarded as the
"Something" into which all other forms of energy seem to melt or
dissolve. The "Electrical Theory of the Universe" is the latest
scientific doctrine, and is growing rapidly in popularity and
general acceptance. And it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> follows that if we are able to discover
in the phenomena of electricity-even at the very root and source of its
manifestations a clear and unmistakable evidence of the presence of
Gender and its activities, we are justified in asking you to believe
that science at last has offered proofs of the existence in all
universal phenomena of that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Hermetic Principle-the Principle of
Gender.

It is not necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> up your <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> with the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known phenomena
of the "attraction and repulsion" of the atoms; chemical affinity; the
"loves and hates" of the atomic particles; the attraction or cohesion
between the molecules of matter. These facts are too <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> known to need
extended comment from us. But, have you ever considered that all of
these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> are manifestations of the Gender Principle? Can you not see
that the phenomena is "on all fours" with that of the corpuscles or
electrons? And more than this, can you not see the reasonableness of the
Hermetic Teachings which assert that the very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Gravitation-that
strange attraction by <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of which all particles and bodies of matter
in the universe tend toward each other is but another manifestation of
the Principle of Gender, which operates in the direction of attracting
the Masculine to the Feminine energies, and vice versa? We cannot offer
you scientific proof of this at this time-but examine the phenomena in
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the Hermetic Teachings on the subject, and see if you have
not a better working hypothesis than any offered by <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> science.
Submit all <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> phenomena to the test, and you will discern the
Principle of Gender ever in evidence.

Let us now <span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> on to a consideration of the operation of the Principle
on the Mental Plane. Many interesting features are there awaiting
examination.



<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">CHAPTER</span> XIV

MENTAL GENDER

Students of psychology who have followed the modern trend of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span>
along the lines of mental phenomena are struck by the persistence of the
dual-mind <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> which has manifested itself so strongly during the past
ten or fifteen years, and which has given rise to a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of plausible
theories regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and constitution of these "two minds." The
late Thomson J. Hudson attained <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> popularity in 1893 by advancing
his well-known theory of the "objective and subjective minds" which he
held existed in every individual. Other writers have attracted almost
equal attention by the theories regarding the "conscious and
subconscious minds"; the "voluntary and involuntary minds"; "the active
and passive minds," etc., etc. The theories of the various writers
differ from each other, but there remains the underlying principle of
"the duality of mind."

The student of the Hermetic Philosophy is tempted to smile when he reads
and hears of these many "new theories" regarding the duality of mind,
each school adhering tenaciously to its own pet theories, and each
claiming to have "discovered the truth." The student turns back the
pages of occult history, and away back in the dim beginnings of occult
teachings he finds references to the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> Hermetic doctrine of the
Principle of Gender on the Mental Plane-the manifestation of Mental
Gender. And examining further he finds that the <span class="t21 hoverable">ancient</span> philosophy <span class="t2 t4 t6 t9 t18 t19 t22 hoverable">took</span>
cognizance of the phenomenon of the "dual mind," and accounted for it by
the theory of Mental Gender. This <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of Mental Gender may be explained
in a few <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span> to students who are familiar with the modern theories
just alluded to. The Masculine Principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> corresponds to the
so-called Objective Mind; Conscious Mind; Voluntary Mind; Active Mind,
etc. And the Feminine Principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> corresponds to the so-called
Subjective Mind; Sub-conscious Mind; Involuntary Mind; Passive Mind,
etc. Of course the Hermetic Teachings do not agree with the many modern
theories regarding the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> phases of mind, nor does it
admit many of the facts claimed for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> respective aspects--some of
the said theories and claims being very far-fetched and incapable of
standing the test of experiment and demonstration.  We point to the
phases of agreement merely for the purpose of helping the student to
assimilate his previously acquired <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> with the teachings of the
Hermetic Philosophy. Students of Hudson will notice the statement at the
beginning of his <span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of "The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of Psychic Phenomena," that:
"The mystic jargon of the Hermetic philosophers discloses the same
general idea" i.e., the duality of mind. If Dr. Hudson had <span class="t2 t5 t11 t18 t19 t23 t26 hoverable">taken</span>
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and trouble to decipher a little of "the mystic jargon of the
Hermetic Philosophy," he might have received much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the subject
of "the dual mind"--but then, perhaps, his most interesting <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> might
not have been written. Let us now consider the Hermetic Teachings
regarding Mental Gender.

The Hermetic Teachers impart their instruction regarding this subject by
bidding their students examine the report of their <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span>
regarding their Self. The students are bidden to turn their attention
inward <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Self dwelling <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> each. Each student is led to see
that his <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> gives him first a report of the existence of his
Self-the report is "I Am." This at first seems to be the final <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">words</span>
from the consciousness, but a little further examination discloses the
<span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that this "I Am" may be separated or split into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct parts,
or aspects, which while working in unison and in conjunction, yet,
nevertheless, may be separated in consciousness.

While at first there seems to be only an "I" existing, a more careful
and closer examination reveals the <span class="t7 t12 t13 hoverable">fact</span> that there exists an "I" and a
"Me." These mental twins differ in their characteristics and nature, and
an examination of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> and the phenomena arising from the same
will throw much <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> many of the problems of mental influence.

Let us begin with a consideration of the Me, which is usually mistaken
for the I by the student, until he presses the inquiry a little further
back into the recesses of consciousness. A <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> thinks of his Self (in
its aspect of Me) as being composed of certain feelings, tastes likes,
dislikes, habits, peculiar ties, characteristics, etc., all of which go
to make up his personality, or the "Self" known to himself and others.
He knows that these emotions and feelings change; are <span class="t9 t24 hoverable">born</span> and die away;
are subject to the Principle of Rhythm, and the Principle of Polarity,
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">take</span> him from one extreme of feeling to another. He also thinks of
the "Me" as being certain <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> gathered <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">together</span> in his mind, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> forming a part of himself. This is the "Me" of a man.

But we have proceeded too hastily. The "Me" of many <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> may be said to
consist largely of their <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and their <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span>
appetites, etc. Their <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> being largely bound up with their
bodily nature, they practically "live there." Some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> even go so far as
to regard their personal apparel as a part of their "Me" and actually
seem to consider it a part of themselves. A writer has humorously said
that "men consist of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> parts--soul, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and clothes." These
"clothes conscious" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> lose their personality if divested of
their clothing by savages <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the occasion of a shipwreck. But even
many who are not so closely bound up with the <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of personal raiment
stick closely to the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of their bodies being their "Me" They
cannot conceive of a Self independent of the body. Their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> seems to
them to be practically "a something belonging to" their body-which in
many cases it is indeed.

But as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> rises in the scale of <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> he is able to disentangle
his "Me" from his <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of body, and is able to think of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as
"belonging to" the mental part of him. But even then he is very apt to
identify the "Me" entirely with the mental states, feelings, etc., which
he feels to exist <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him. He is very apt to consider these internal
states as identical with himself, instead of their being simply "things"
produced by some part of his mentality, and existing <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> him--of him,
and in him, but still not "himself." He sees that he may change these
internal states of feelings by all effort of will, and that he may
produce a feeling or <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> of an exactly opposite nature, in the same
way, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the same "Me" exists. And so after a while he is able to
<span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> aside these various mental states, emotions, feelings, habits,
qualities, characteristics, and other personal mental belongings--he is
able to <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t22 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">set</span> them aside in the "not-me" collection of curiosities and
encumbrances, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as valuable possessions. This requires much mental
concentration and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of mental analysis on the part of the student.
But still the task is possible for the advanced student, and even those
not so far advanced are able to see, in the imagination, how the process
may be performed.

After this laying-aside process has been performed, the student will
<span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> himself in conscious possession of a "Self" which may be considered
in its "I" and "Me" dual aspects. The "Me" will be felt to be a
Something mental in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and other
mental states may be produced. It may be considered as the "mental
womb," as the ancients styled it-capable of generating mental offspring.
It reports to the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> as a "Me" with latent powers of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span>
and generation of mental progeny of all sorts and kinds. Its powers of
creative energy are felt to be enormous. But still it seems to be
conscious that it must receive some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of energy from either its "I"
companion, or else from some other "I" ere it is able to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> into
being its mental creations. This <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> brings with it a
realization of an enormous capacity for mental <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> and creative
ability.

But the student soon finds that this is not all that he finds <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">within</span> his
inner consciousness. He finds that there exists a mental Something which
is able to Will that the "Me" act along certain creative lines, and
which is also able to stand aside and witness the mental creation. This
part of himself he is taught to <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> his "I." He is able to rest in its
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> at will. He finds there not a <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of an ability
to generate and actively create, in the <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> of the gradual process
attendant <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> mental operations, but rather a <span class="t0 t1 t7 t12 t13 t14 t17 t23 t27 t28 hoverable">sense</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span>
of an ability to project an energy from the "I" to the "Me"--a process
of "willing" that the mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> begin and proceed. He also finds
that the "I" is able to stand aside and witness the operations of the
"Me's" mental <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> and generation. There is this dual aspect in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of every person. The "I" represents the Masculine Principle of
Mental Gender-the "Me" represents the Female Principle. The "I"
represents the Aspect of Being; the "Me" the Aspect of Becoming. You
will notice that the Principle of Correspondence operates on this plane
just as it does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> which the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of
Universes is performed. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> are similar in kind, although
vastly different in degree. "As above, so below; as below, so above."

These aspects of mind-the Masculine and Feminine Principles-the "I" and
the "Me"-considered in connection with the well-known mental and psychic
phenomena, give the master-key to these dimly known regions of mental
operation and manifestation. The principle of Mental Gender gives the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> underlying the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> field of the phenomena of mental influence,
etc.

The tendency of the Feminine Principle is always in the direction of
receiving impressions, while the tendency of the Masculine Principle is
always in the direction of giving, out or expressing. The Feminine
Principle has much more varied field of operation than has the Masculine
Principle. The Feminine Principle conducts the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of generating new
thoughts, concepts, ideas, including the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the imagination. The
Masculine Principle contents itself with the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the "Will" in its
varied phases. And yet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> the active aid of the Will of the
Masculine Principle, the Feminine Principle is apt to rest content with
generating mental images which are the result of impressions received
from outside, instead of producing original mental creations.

Persons who can give continued attention and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">thought</span> to a subject
actively employ both of the Mental Principles-the Feminine in the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
of the mental generation, and the Masculine Will in stimulating and
energizing the creative portion of the mind. The majority of persons
really employ the Masculine Principle but little, and are content to
live according to the thoughts and ideas instilled into the "Me" from
the "I" of other minds. But it is not our purpose to dwell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this
phase of the subject, which may be studied from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> text-book <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>
psychology, with the key that we have given you regarding Mental Gender.

The student of Psychic Phenomena is aware of the wonderful phenomena
classified under the <span class="t1 t4 t9 t16 hoverable">head</span> of Telepathy; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Thought</span> Transference; Mental
Influence; Suggestion; Hypnotism, etc. Many have sought for an
explanation of these varied phases of phenomena under the theories of
the various "dual mind" teachers. And in a measure they are right, for
there is clearly a manifestation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> distinct phases of mental
activity. But if such students will consider these "dual minds" in the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the Hermetic Teachings regarding Vibrations and Mental Gender,
they will see that the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">long</span> sought for key is at hand.

In the phenomena of Telepathy it is seen how the Vibratory Energy of the
Masculine Principle is projected toward the Feminine Principle of
another person, and the latter takes the seed-thought and allows it to
develop into maturity. In the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Suggestion and Hypnotism
operates. The Masculine Principle of the <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> giving the suggestions
directs a stream of Vibratory Energy or Will-Power toward the Feminine
Principle of the other person, and the latter accepting it makes it its
own and acts and thinks accordingly. An <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> lodged in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of
another <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> grows and develops, and in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> is regarded as the
rightful mental offspring of the individual, whereas it is in reality
like the cuckoo egg placed in the sparrows nest, where it destroys the
rightful offspring and makes itself at home. The normal method is for
the Masculine and Feminine Principles in a person's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to co-ordinate
and act harmoniously in conjunction with each other, but, unfortunately,
the Masculine Principle in the average <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> is too lazy to act-the
display of Will-Power is too slight-and the consequence is that such
persons are ruled almost entirely by the minds and wills of other
persons, whom they allow to do their thinking and willing for them.
How few original thoughts or original actions are performed by the
average person? Are not the majority of persons mere shadows and echoes
of others having stronger wills or minds than themselves? The trouble is
that the average <span class="t0 t4 t5 t10 t22 t25 t28 hoverable">person</span> dwells almost altogether in his "Me"
<span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> and does not realize that he has such a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> as an "I."
He is polarized in his Feminine Principle of Mind, and the Masculine
Principle, in which is lodged the Will, is allowed to remain inactive
and not employed.

The strong <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> and women of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> invariably manifest the Masculine
Principle of Will, and their strength depends materially <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> this fact.
Instead of living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the impressions made <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their minds by others,
they dominate their own minds by their Will, obtaining the <span class="t23 hoverable">kind</span> of
mental images desired, and moreover dominate the minds of others
likewise, in the same manner. Look at the strong people, how they manage
to implant their seed-thoughts in the minds of the masses of the people,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> causing the latter to think thoughts in accordance with the desires
and wills of the strong individuals. This is why the masses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
are such sheeplike creatures, never originating an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> of their own,
nor using their own powers of mental activity.

The manifestation of Mental Gender may be noticed all around us in
everyday life. The magnetic persons are those who are able to <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> the
Masculine Principle in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of impressing their ideas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> others.
The actor who makes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> weep or cry as he wills, is employing this
principle. And so is the successful orator, statesman, preacher, writer
or other <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who are before the public attention. The peculiar
influence exerted by some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> over others is due to the manifestation
of Mental Gender, along the Vibrational lines above indicated. In this
principle lies the secret of personal magnetism, personal influence,
fascination, etc., as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the phenomena generally grouped under the
name of Hypnotism.

The student who has familiarized himself with the phenomena generally
spoken of as "psychic" will have discovered the important part played in
the said phenomena by that force which science has styled "Suggestion,"
by which term is meant the process or method whereby an <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> is
transferred to, or "impressed upon" the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> of another, causing the
<span class="t0 t2 t5 t13 t14 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> to act in accordance therewith. A correct understanding of
Suggestion is necessary in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to intelligently comprehend the varied
psychical phenomena which Suggestion underlies. But, still more is a
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of Vibration and Mental Gender necessary for the student of
Suggestion. For the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">whole</span> principle of Suggestion depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
principle of Mental Gender and Vibration.

It is customary for the writers and teachers of Suggestion to explain
that it is the "objective or voluntary" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> which make the mental
impression, or suggestion, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the "subjective or involuntary" mind.
But they do not describe the process or give us any analogy in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span>
whereby we may more readily comprehend the idea. But if you will think
of the matter in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the Hermetic Teachings you will be able to
see that the energizing of the Feminine Principle by the Vibratory
Energy of the Masculine Principle Is in accordance to the universal laws
of nature, and that the natural <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> affords countless analogies
whereby the principle may be understood. In fact, the Hermetic Teachings
show that the very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">creation</span> of the Universe follows the same law, and
that in all creative manifestations, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the planes of the spiritual,
the mental, and the physical, there is always in operation this
principle of Gender-this manifestation of the Masculine and the Feminine
Principles. "As above, so below; as below, so above." And more than
this, when the principle of Mental Gender is once grasped and
understood, the varied phenomena of psychology at once becomes capable
of intelligent classification and study, instead of being very much in
the dark. The principle "works out" in practice, because it is based
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the immutable universal laws of life.

We shall not enter into an extended discussion of, or description of,
the varied phenomena of mental influence or psychic activity. There are
many books, many of them quite good, which have been <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> and
published on this subject of late years. The main facts stated in these
various books are correct, although the several writers have attempted
to explain the phenomena by various pet theories of their own. The
student may acquaint himself with these matters, and by using the theory
of Mental Gender he will be able to <span class="t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t27 t29 hoverable">bring</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> out of the chaos of
conflicting theory and teachings, and may, moreover, readily make
himself a <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> of the subject if he be so inclined. The purpose of
this <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is not to give an extended <span class="t1 t11 t12 t13 t16 t18 t21 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">account</span> of psychic phenomena but
rather to give to the student a master-key whereby He may unlock the
many doors leading into the parts of the Temple of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> which he
may wish to explore. We feel that in this consideration of the teachings
of The Kybalion, one may <span class="t5 t14 t15 t24 t27 hoverable">find</span> an explanation which will serve to clear
away many perplexing difficulties--a key that will unlock many doors.
What is the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of going into detail regarding all of the many features
of psychic phenomena and mental science, provided we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t20 hoverable">hands</span>

any phase of the subject which may interest him. With the aid of The
Kybalion one may go through any occult library anew, the old <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> from

HERMETIC AXIOMS

    "The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a
    manifestation and expression in Action, is like the
    hoarding of precious metals-a vain and foolish thing.
    Knowledge, like wealth, is intended for Use. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of
    <span class="t1 hoverable">Use</span> is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by
    <span class="t1 t11 t16 t20 t25 t27 t28 hoverable">reason</span> of his conflict with natural forces."--The Kybalion.

The Hermetic Teachings, while always having been kept securely locked up
in the minds of the fortunate possessors thereof, for reasons which we
have already stated, were never intended to be merely stored away and
secreted. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of <span class="t1 hoverable">Use</span> is dwelt <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> in the Teachings, as you may see
by reference to the above quotation from The Kybalion, which states it
forcibly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Knowledge</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> <span class="t1 hoverable">Use</span> and Expression is a vain thing, bringing
no <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> to its possessor, or to the race. Beware of Mental Miserliness,
and express into Action that which you have learned. Study the Axioms
and Aphorisms, but practice them also.

We give below some of the more important Hermetic Axioms, from The
Kybalion, with a few comments added to each. Make these your own, and
practice and <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> them, for they are not really your own until you have
<span class="t0 t12 hoverable">Used</span> them.

    "To change your mood or mental state--change your
    vibration."--The Kybalion.

One may change his mental vibrations by an effort of Will, in the
direction of deliberately fixing the Attention <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a more desirable
state. Will directs the Attention, and Attention changes the Vibration.
Cultivate the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Art</span> of Attention, by means of the Will, and you have
solved the secret of the Mastery of Moods and Mental States.

    "To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration,
    put into operation the principle of Polarity and
    concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the opposite pole to that which
    you <span class="t0 t10 t11 t17 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">desire</span> to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by
    changing its polarity."--The Kybalion.

This is one of the most important of the Hermetic Formulas. It is based
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> scientific principles. We have shown you that a mental <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span>
and its opposite were merely the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poles of one thing, and that by
Mental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed. This Principle is
known to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of
undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> trying
to "kill out" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and
the <span class="t9 t19 hoverable">Fear</span> will disappear. Some writers have expressed this <span class="t0 hoverable">idea</span> most
forcibly by using the illustration of the dark room. You do not have to
shovel out or sweep out the Darkness, but by merely opening the shutters
and letting in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> the Darkness has disappeared. To kill out a
Negative quality, concentrate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Positive Pole of that same
quality, and the vibrations will gradually change from Negative to
Positive, until finally you will become polarized on the
Positive pole instead of the Negative. The reverse is also true, as many
have found out to their sorrow, when they have allowed themselves to
vibrate too constantly on the Negative pole of things. By changing your
polarity you may <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> your moods, change your mental states, remake
your disposition, and build up character. Much of the Mental Mastery of
the advanced Hermetics is due to this application of Polarity, which is
one of the important aspects of Mental Transmutation. Remember the
Hermetic Axiom (quoted previously), which says:

    "Mind (as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as metals and elements) may be transmuted
    from <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> to state; degree to degree, condition to
    condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration."--The Kybalion.

The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles
of Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless one acquires the
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">art</span> of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his
environment. An understanding of this principle will enable one to
change his own Polarity, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as that of others, if he will but
devote the time, care, study and practice necessary to <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> the art.
The principle is true, but the results obtained depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the
persistent patience and practice of the student.

    "Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t7 t8 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Art</span>
    of Polarization."--The Kybalion.

As we have explained in previous chapters, the Hermetists hold that the
Principle of Rhythm manifests on the Mental Plane as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as on the
<span class="t1 hoverable">Physical</span> Plane, and that the bewildering succession of moods, feelings,
emotions, and other mental states, are due to the backward and forward
swing of the mental pendulum, which carries us from one extreme of
feeling to the other. The Hermetists also teach that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Law</span> of
Neutralization enables one, to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent, to overcome the operation
of Rhythm in consciousness. As we have explained, there is a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span>
Plane of Consciousness, as <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as the ordinary Lower Plane, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">Master</span> by rising mentally to the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Plane causes the swing of the
mental pendulum to manifest on the Lower Plane, and he, dwelling on his
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Plane, escapes the <span class="t0 t1 t13 t16 t24 t25 hoverable">consciousness</span> of the swing backward. This is
effected by polarizing on the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">Higher</span> Self, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> raising the mental
vibrations of the Ego above those of the ordinary plane of
consciousness. It is akin to rising above a <span class="t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t25 t28 t29 hoverable">thing</span> and allowing it to
<span class="t2 t3 t4 t6 t11 t12 t19 t22 hoverable">pass</span> beneath you. The advanced Hermetist polarizes himself at the
Positive Pole of his Being-the "I Am" pole rather than the pole of
personality and by "refusing" and "denying" the operation of Rhythm,
raises himself above its plane of consciousness, and standing firm in
his Statement of Being he allows the pendulum to swing back on the Lower
Plane <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> changing his Polarity. This is accomplished by all
individuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, <span class="t0 t5 t8 t10 t14 t15 t21 t24 t28 hoverable">whether</span>
they understand the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> or not. Such persons simply "refuse" to allow
themselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by
steadfastly affirming the superiority they remain polarized on the
Positive pole. The Master, of course, attains a far greater degree of
proficiency, because he understands the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> which he is overcoming by a
<span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> law, and by the <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span> of his Will he attains a degree of Poise and
Mental Steadfastness almost impossible of belief on the part of those
who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by the mental
pendulum of moods and feelings.

Remember always, however, that you do not really destroy the Principle
of Rhythm, for that is indestructible. You simply overcome one <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">law</span> by
counter-balancing it with another and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> maintain an equilibrium. The
laws of balance and counter-balance are in operation on the mental as
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> as on the <span class="t1 hoverable">physical</span> planes, and an understanding of these laws
enables one to seem to overthrow laws, whereas he is merely exerting a
counterbalance.

    "Nothing escapes the Principle of Cause and Effect,
    but there are many Planes of Causation, and one may <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
    the laws of the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> to overcome the laws of the
    lower."--The Kybalion.

By an understanding of the practice of Polarization, the Hermetists rise
to a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of Causation and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> counter-balance the laws of the
lower planes of Causation. By rising above the plane of ordinary Causes
they become themselves, in a degree, Causes instead of being merely
Caused. By being able to <span class="t0 t1 t8 t11 t15 t21 t23 t24 hoverable">master</span> their own moods and feelings, and by
being able to neutralize Rhythm, as we have already explained, they are
able to escape a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> part of the operations of Cause and Effect on the
ordinary plane. The masses of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> are carried along, obedient to
their environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than
themselves; the effects of inherited tendencies; the suggestions of
those about them; and other outward causes; which tend to move them
about on the chess-board of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> like mere pawns. By rising above these
influencing causes, the advanced Hermetists seek a <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> plane of
mental action, and by dominating their moods, emotions, impulses and
feelings, they create for themselves new characters, qualities and
powers, by which they overcome their ordinary environment, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

They <span class="t1 hoverable">use</span>
the Principle of Cause and Effect, instead of being <span class="t0 t12 hoverable">used</span> by
it. Of course, even the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> are subject to the Principle as it
manifests on the <span class="t0 t1 t11 t12 t21 t25 hoverable">higher</span> planes, but on the lower planes of activity,
they are Masters instead of Slaves. As The Kybalion says:

    "The <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> ones serve on the higher, but rule on the lower.
    They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their
    own plane, and those below them they rule and give orders.
    And, yet, in so doing, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> a part of the Principle,

    and by understanding its movements he operates it instead
    of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer

    instead of being as the log which is carried here and
    there--so is the <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as compared to the ordinary
    man--and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> both swimmer and log; <span class="t5 t8 hoverable">wise</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and fool,
    are subject to Law. He who understands this is <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">well</span> on
    the road to Mastery."--The Kybalion.

In conclusion let us again <span class="t8 t13 t21 hoverable">call</span> your attention to the Hermetic Axiom:

    "True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art."--The Kybalion.

In the above axiom, the Hermetists teach that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of
influencing one's environment is accomplished by Mental Power. The
Universe being wholly mental, it follows that it may be ruled only by
Mentality. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">truth</span> is to be found an explanation of all the
phenomena and manifestations of the various mental powers which are
attracting so much attention and study in these earlier <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">years</span> of the
Twentieth Century. Back of and under the teachings of the various cults
and schools, remains ever constant the Principle of the Mental Substance
of the Universe. If the Universe be Mental in its substantial nature,
then it follows that Mental Transmutation must change the conditions and
phenomena of the Universe. If the Universe is Mental, then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Mind</span> must be
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t9 t10 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t22 t23 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> affecting its phenomena. If this be understood then
all the so-called "miracles" and "wonder-workings" are seen plainly for
what they are.

    "THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental."--The Kybalion.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the <span class="t1 t8 hoverable">free</span> distribution of
electronic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> and cannot survive <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of public domain and licensed <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that can be
freely distributed in machine readable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received <span class="t2 t11 t15 t19 t25 t27 hoverable">written</span> confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular <span class="t0 t1 t10 t14 t21 t23 t25 t29 hoverable">state</span> visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a <span class="t8 t21 t27 hoverable">number</span> of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic <span class="t0 t1 t4 t5 t7 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">works</span> that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
