the pre-Gathic times to the present <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and named
the <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> History of Zoroastrianism.
Arrangement and method. I have divided the entire
period of the history of Zoroastrianism on the
linguistic basis. The earliest Zoroastrian documents
are the Gathas, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in the Gathic dialect. They
represent the earliest phase of the religion of
Zoroaster. But ancient Iran had a religion which
preceded Zoroastrianism in point of time. I have
labelled this period pre-Gathic; for its beginning is
lost in remote antiquity, and the advent of Zoroaster
brings its end.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Zoroaster flourished is a moot
question. The approximate date at which he lived is
1000 B.C. Zoroaster revolutionizes the religious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span>
of the Iranians, which hitherto represented the
evolutionary phase of religion. It was the movement
in which we find the religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> creeping for

ages to rise from the lower to the higher level. To <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span>
this in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> way, the pre-Gathic religion of Iran is
the evolution of the religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> age. The prophet of Iran establishes a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
religion. In the pre-Gathic religion the trend of
religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> struggles from the complex to the
simple, from concrete to abstract, and is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> the
farthest removed from the ideal stage.
Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, as preached in the
Gathas is the very embodiment of the simple and the
abstract. It is the realization [xxxii] of the ideal. It is
the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> to which the coming generations have to
conform. Deviation from it <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> a fall, a
degeneration of the religous life. This <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> period I
have termed Gathic.
Decay soon begins in the language in which
Zoroaster composed his immortal hymns, and his
successors now write in the Avestan dialect, which
replaces the Gathic. The Avestan language remains
the <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> language of the Zoroastrians from now
onward to probably the last <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of the Parthians,
when the Pahlavi language becomes the court
language of the Sasanians and supersedes the
Avestan. The most extensive literature on
Zoroastrianism is <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in Avestan. This period,
which I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Later Avestan period, extends to
the early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Pahlavi era and goes <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
beyond it. When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> periods <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> overlap each
other, it often becomes difficult to determine
whether a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> phase of religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is on
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> side or the other of the dividing line between
them. The Avestan works, in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in which they
were <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in the Avestan period, no longer exist.
They were scattered by the storm that swept over

Persia when Alexander conquered the country, and
shook her religious edifice to its base. The <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> in
which the Avestan texts have reached us is that
which was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> them during the Pahlavi period. The
artists employed to restore the broken edifice belong
to the Pahlavi period, but the materials <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>
down from the Avestan sources.
The Pahlavi period ranks fourth in the arrangement
of the present work, and it covers a period of about
eight centuries. Although it is most productive under
the Sasanian rule, it does not close with the collapse
of this, the last of the Zoroastrian empires, but
survives it by at least <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries in Moslem
Persia. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> Pahlavi had replaced Avestan, the
early <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in the ancient language had not
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> ceased to influence the Pahlavi writers. In fact,
some of the most important of the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> are
either versions of some Avestan <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> now lost to us,
or draw their <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> from the Avestan sources.
Thus, the Pahlavi Bundahishn is the epitome of the
Avestan Damdat [Damdad] Nask, which is subsequently
lost. Similarly, not a few of the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span>
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> centuries after the conquest of Persia by
the Arabs tenaciously preserve the tradition handed
down by Sasanian Persia. These are characterized by
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> layers of thought, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> traditional, and the other
representing <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> [xxxiii] <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> current during the
writer's times. The Menuk-i Khrat, for example, betrays
Moslem influence when it preaches fatalism, but is
otherwise faithfully voicing the sentiments of the
orthodox Sasanian Church. This interweaving of <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span>
ideas with the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> ones, and the interpolations and
additions of the later writers in the <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> of earlier
generations, often <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> it hopeless to disentangle the
complications and distinguish between the opinions

and ideas of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> periods.
Thirteen hundred <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> have elapsed since the
dissolution of the last of the Zoroastrian empires.
Henceforth we have to record the religious history of
the Zoroastrian remnants in Persia and the
Zoroastrian settlers of India. Zoroastrianism sinks
with the Zoroastrian power, and a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of
obscurity follows. I have named it a period of
decadence.
Under the aegis of the British rule in India
Zoroastrianism emerges once again with the
prosperity of the Parsi community. I have hailed this
as the period of the revival of Zoroastrianism.
These various periods, which represent
chronologically <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> stages of the historical
development of the religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of Iran, from
remote antiquity down to the immediate present,
will, I hope, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> the reader a general and
comprehensive view of the history of Zoroastrian
religion. As the subjects are treated piece-meal in
<span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> periods <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the natural growth of
ideas from period to period, the reader will have to
read crosswise when he needs a complete account of
any particular concept. For example, if he wants to
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> all that the Zoroastrian literature has to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span>
about Ormazd [Ohrmazd], he will get it as a <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span>
not from any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> period, but from all. The detailed
list of contents and the index will help him in his
inquiry.
Transliteration of the technical terms. I have sought
to preserve the changes that these have undergone
during successive periods, and have variously
transliterated them in the treatment of the <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>

periods, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> as they represent the Avestan,
Pahlavi, or Persian pronunciations. Thus, for
example, Ahura Mazda of the Gathic and Avestan
periods <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> Ormazd [Ohrmazd] in the Pahlavi
period. Angra Mainyu assumes the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Ahriman in
the subsequent periods. The Avestan Vohu Manah
changes into Pahlavi Vohuman and into Bahman in
Persian. In the frequent use of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the
prophet, I have, however, not scrupulously followed
this method. I have distinguished between the
Avestan, [xxxiv] Pahlavi, and Persian forms by
writing Zarathushtra for the first, and Zaratusht for
Pahlavi and Zartusht [Zartosht] for Persian as they
actually occur in these languages; but I have adopted
the more familiar <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Zoroaster for general use.
Similarly, I have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the religion of the prophet
Zoroastrianism. With a view to simplicity for the
general reader, I have avoided, as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as it has been
practicable, the free use of diacritical marks, and have
employed simple transcriptions of the names of the
heavenly beings persons, and books when they occur
in the text.

Notes:
<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">CHAPTER</span> I
THE SOURCES
The data of information. The materials that we
gather for the preparation of the history of the
religion that Zarathushtra preached in Ancient Iran
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from varied sources. The earliest native records
are embodied in the sacred texts in which the
prophet and his immediate disciples propounded the
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> religion. These are furnished by the Avestan
literature, which is followed by the Pahlavi and
Pazend [Pazand] <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> and finally by the writings in
Modern Persian down to the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the eighteenth
century.
Peoples of diverse faiths and nationalities have
likewise, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> about Zoroaster and his teachings
from the earliest to the modern times. Greeks and
Romans and Christians in the Occident and Indians,
Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Armenians, and Chinese in
the Orient have contributed to the fund of
information on the subject. Zarathushtra has founded
a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> religion and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> begin with the
consideration of the materials <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> in the foundation,
which are to be gleaned from the Avesta, the earliest
literature produced by Iran.
The Avestan Nasks. Tradition credits Zarathushtra
with having <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> profusely. Pliny states that the

The Pahlavi, Pazend, and Persian sources. During
the chaos that prevailed in Iran after the downfall of
the Achaemenian empire, the Avestan language
began to decay. When it grew unintelligible to the
people, the learned priests undertook translations and
explanations of the Avestan texts into Pahlavi, [5] the

under the barbarous rule of the Tartars. Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span>
on religious subjects that are extant consist of about
446,000 words.10
With the invention of the modern Persian alphabet,
Pahlavi fell into the background. An admixture of
Aryan and Semitic make-up the Pahlavi language as
written. It was later simplified by the elimination of
all Semitic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> and replacing them with their
Iranian equivalents. The original Avestan texts were
explained and interpreted by the Pahlavi commentary
which, as we saw, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Zand. A further need

Parsi-Sanskrit and Gujarati sources. An Indian
school of Parsi Sanskritists of the thirteenth century,

headed by Neryosang Dhaval, has translated some
parts of the Avestan texts into Sanskrit from their
Pahlavi version. Besides these, they have left for us
the Sanskrit translation of a few Pahlavi works.
A considerable literature, in prose and verse, has
appeared in Gujarati on Zoroastrian subjeccts in
India. A Gujarati version of the Yasna and Vendidad
and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> renderings of the Khordah Avesta were

penetrated into India. <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">Works</span> <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in Gujarati

Oriental sources. The Indo-Iranians shared a
common religious heritage, and the Rig Veda
furnishes us with the earliest sacred texts that are
helpful in the better understanding of the religious
beliefs of the pre-Gathic, Gathic, and the Younger
Avestan periods of the history of Zoroastrianism.
There are, likewise, scattered passages in the Vedas,
Brahmanas, Smriti, and Puranas that refer to the
Iranians and their religion. Judaism under the Exile
was influenced by Zoroastrian teachings and
furnishes us with points of resemblance between the
angelology, demonology, and eschatology of the
Iranians and the Hebrews. The Armenian historians
Moses of Khoren and Elisaeus, the theologians Eznik
and the Syrian Theodore bar Khoni, the Acts and

Occidental sources. The contact of Persia with

Achaemenians. It continued with Rome up to the

B.C. and 6000 B.C. It is an uncontested fact that
there is a marked closeness between the grammar,
metre, and style of the Rig Veda and the Gathas. The
Gathic inflexions are more primitive than the Vedic.
The period of the position of the Gathas, therefore,
<span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be separated from the Vedas by any

birth is of equal uncertainty. His earliest appearance

country. He has often visited the central places
where trade routes from distant lands converged and
has gathered information and experience from the
worldly-wise travellers, merchants, and pilgrims. But

the more he has learnt, the more eager his desire to
learn further has grown. His teachers had instructed
him in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> based on tradition. But tradition is
stagnant, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> on the onward move.
Besides, tradition is wedded to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> that is dead,

be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> on trust, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> is based on inquiry
and discussion. Reason is shadowed by doubt and
doubt is the parent of knowledge. Zarathushtra, a
paragon of reason, doubts the wisdom of his teachers.
Zarathushtra resolves to be his own teacher, and to
learn by observation and thinking. He thinks and
thinks deeply and comprehensively on the conditions
prevailing around him. He considers that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is not
woven of the tissues of joy and happiness alone, but
of considerable sorrow and misery also. Injustice and
inequity, strife and oppression, poverty and
destitution, greed [14] and avarice, wrath and rapine,
falsehood and deceit, envy and malice, hatred and
jealousy, crime and vice, sorrow and suffering, filth
and disease confront him everywhere. He is keenly
responsive to <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> sufferings and the groans and
sighs of the agonized hearts. The misery of the
multitude touches his heart. His flesh creeps, his
<span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> is heavily oppressed, and his <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> is depressed
at the sight of this dark side of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> life. He suffers
at the sight of suffering and, with eyes suffused with
tears, he lives from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> thinking and
brooding over the woes of the world. Zarathushtra
doubts the goodness of gods.
He is religious at heart, but his daily experience of
the religion practised and lived around him tends to
estrange him from the faith of his forefathers. He sees
with horror temples reeking with the blood of

sacrifical animals. He finds that barren formalism,
sanctimonious scrupulosity, meticulous ablutions,
superstitious fear, and display of external holiness
<span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> for religion. Zarathushtra doubts the religion of
his birth.
Zarathushtra seeks silent, solitary seclusion.
Solitude is nature's sublime temple where <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> can
commune with <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> in the surrounding silence and
unruffled calm. Mountains lift their heads
majestically on the Iranian plateau, and Zarathushtra
retreated into the mountain fastness. Here, <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span>

But the messenger of Mazda is determined to face
them and overcome them and emerge triumphant in
the end. He tells Mazda that he will lead mankind on

praise all around as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is blessed with

of a universal religion. He is convinced that the
religion that Ahura Mazda has commissioned him to
preach is the best for all mankind.36 He looks forward
to winning all living <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> for the faith of Ahura
Mazda.37
But the ardent desire of the prophet was not to be
fulfilled [18] at the moment, nor to be accomplished
in full measure in after ages. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Though</span> possessed of all

Zoroastrianism has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> shown any signs of
becoming a universal religion. In the midst of the
vicissitudes of fortune, it has been a national religion
at best. Little short of a miracle has saved it from
total extinction, and various causes have combined to
reduce it to the narrowest limits today as the
communal religion of a hundred and twenty-five

thousand souls. This fact will be <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> out more
prominently in the treatment of the religious
development during the subsequent periods.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">People</span> marvel at the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> prophet. Zarathushtra
turned his steps to his <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of birth and childhood.
His kinsfolk and friends recognized him and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> they
were bewildered to witness a marvellous change in

there was something indescribable that those who

and serene. It breathed ineffable kindness and bore
shining reflection of his pure inner life. It wore the
expression of gentleness and cheerfulness, hope and
confidence. A resplendent halo of righteousness
encircled his magnetic face. He moved <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>

him. The sublimity of his serene behaviour, the
childlike simplicity of his speech, the unassuming
attitude of his movements, the imperturbable calm
and passive countenance aroused feelings of
reverence in those who met him. They greeted him
with salutations and adoration. His advent soon
became the event of surrounding villages. All eagerly
pointed to him and talked abour him. In dumb
veneration <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> gazed at him, admired him, adored
him, and marvelled at him. He was Zarathushtra of
the Spitamas, they said, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he was altogether a novel

unheard of words, he talked of unknown things. He
was what they were not. They were but men, he was
greater than man, he was an angel, he was a godling.
Zarathushtra definitely breaks with the religion of
his forefathers. Zarathushtra has seen by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span>

Signs of disapprobation, whispers of disapproval,
murmurs of indignation now appeared in various

The hostile Daevayasnian priests. The priests of the
ancient faith were now alarmed. They attempted to
dissuade the prophet from disturbing the peace of the
people. They met often to argue with him on the
questions he was raising, but were foiled in the
controversies.38 They felt themselves humiliated
before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> and gave up meeting the prophet.

Zarathushtra speaks of him as Kavi Vishtaspa.41 It is

the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> religion, deserted him. The ignorant and
unthinking people, who had, with child-like
curiosity, turned wherever his footsteps trod, imitated
the elders of society and left him. Those who were
proud to claim him as their friend forsook him when
the hour <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> for them to stand by him. Those that
were his kith and kin disowned him, because he had
disavowed their ancestral faith. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> did the
wavering, timid, half-hearted followers fail him in his
hour of need and leave him. Ahura Mazda alone did
not leave him and, [23] with him on his side,
Zarathushtra felt that he was not alone in his
loneliness. His prestige, however, is shattered and all
restraint is broken. Respect for him is gone. He is
now greeted everywhere with hostile feelings and
coarse jokes. The mob that was hilarious in his
commendation becomes furious in his condemnation.
It mocks and maligns, jeers and insults him.

SPENTA MAINYU
Spenta Mainyu is the self-revealing activity of
Ahura Mazda. The supreme godhead, we have seen,
is immutable, perfect, <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> unity. Zarathushtra
solves the problem of reconciling the unchangeable

postulating a principle that intervenes between the
unmoved mover and the moved. This working
medium of Ahura Mazda spans the chasm between
the supersensuous and the sensuous. He brings the
transcendence and immanence of Ahura Mazda into a
synthesis. Ahura Mazda is <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> completely
separated nor completely merged in the world. He is
the primordial, self-existing being. In his infinite
goodness he wills the <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> of the universe. Both
heavenly and earthly existence lived with him and in
him as idealized contents of his being. The
projection or manifestation of his creative will and
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> is his active working principle Spenta

is not an entity or personality. Ahura Mazda is the

image, his replica. He represents the creative
attribute of Ahura Mazda in his relation to the
created world.

The Gathas variously speak of Spenta Mainyu either
as the attribute of Ahura Mazda or as his vicegerent,
or as his co-worker, or as identified with him or as
distinct from him. It is Spenta Mainyu that Ahura
Mazda creates cattle and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and plants and all that

MAZDA'S MINISTERING ANGELS
Amesha Spentas in the making. Zarathushtra holds
before mankind six cardinal virtues of Ahura Mazda
for emulation. Primarily, they are pure abstractions,
etherealized moral concepts, symbolic ideals, abstract
figures. They have no individuality, no
characteristics, no mythology as the Indo-Iranian
divinities have. Zarathushtra aims at replacing the
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> beings that owe their origin to some natural

his worshipful attributes of Ahura Mazda. In the

comes second. They are followed by Khshathra and

Manah, 'Mind,' all the <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> have not the

at the later period. At times Vohu Manah's epithet
designating his goodness is transferred to Khshathra.5
As the process towards the personification of Ahura
Mazda's attributes has already begun, it is often
extremely difficult to decide whether the qualitative
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> expressions stand for personified beings or as
abstract nouns designating <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> virtues in
application to Ahura Mazda himself or to man.
The prominent feature of these six abstract attributes
when they have fully grown into Ahura Mazda's
ministering angels is the twofold character of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>
they are assigned to perform. [41] In addition to a
specific virtue that each represents on the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
side, a material object is <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> under his or her direct
guardianship on the physical side. This physical

use of the word. It is in the <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Persian inscriptions,
however, that we find the use of arta as an element of
proper names. The Pahlavi writers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> a more

Zarathushtra best exemplifies Asha's righteousness
in his life. Zarathushtra is pure in body, mind, and
spirit. He is the embodiment of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> thoughts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
words, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> deeds. He thinks, speaks, and acts
righteousness. He lives in the atmosphere of
righteousness and radiates it all around him. He is the
very righteousness itself living in flesh for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>
of mankind. Righteousness sustains him in his
hardships and trials. When his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> prophetic <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span>

when, friendless and forsaken, hissed and hooted,

Mazda and Asha in search of inward peace, and
obtains it.110 Reduced to the verge of the direst
poverty, Zarathushtra does not seek earthly riches,
but the imperishable wealth of the spirit, that is,
righteousness.
Righteousness is the pivot around which the ethics
of Zarathushtra revolves. Asha is the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span>

saintly and possesses the noblest character. The term
is applied to Ahura Mazda, Zarathushtra, and to all
who are religious. Righteousness is the will of Ahura
Mazda; it is the rule of man's duty, and to be

in the Gathas as the giver of joy and prosperity,
represents the animal creation. Tradition explains
Gav Azi as 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> cow.'

Prayer in its origin is instinctive and it gradually
grows rational and moral. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Man</span> has always wearied

mental and moral progress has purified prayer.
Naturally, he prays for his health and vigour of body,
for food and riches, for offspring and <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> life. In his
nobler mood, he prays for purity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">mind</span> and heart.

Prayers were mostly petitions for gifts of health, <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span>

Indo-Iranians were not behind other peoples and
their sacrificial offerings consisted of milk and melted

butter, grain and vegetables, flesh of goats and sheep,
bulls and horses, and the exhilarating Soma-Haoma
beverage. Elaborate rituals and sacrifices offered to
obtain coveted boons, to gain the remission of sins,
and to stave off the terrors of hell. The consecrated
food was partaken of by the sacrificers to reap the
merit. The altars were reeking with the blood of
animals that were sacrificed to innumerable gods.
Zarathushtra does <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> with such sacrifices and

It inspires devotional fervour and purity of thoughts.
Zarathushtra presumably utilized this formal side of
religion to stimulate religious emotion and inspire
righteous conduct. Tradition ascribes the division of
society into priests, warriors, husbandmen, and
artisans to the initiative of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Yima [=Jamshed] of

in the Gathas. He does not mention âthravan, 'the
protector of fire' or priest. The Later Avesta speaks of
the sacerdotal class by the title of âthravan. The
Pahlavi texts continue to employ this priestly
designation, and in addition speak of it as magopat, or
magpat, corresponding to the Greek <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> Magi or
Magus. Zarathushtra uses the forms derived from
maga, 'great,' but it <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that he uses them

The Later Avestan texts speak of distinct
functionaries who officiated at the sacrificial
ceremonies. The head of this group is zaotar,
corresponding to Skt. hotar, 'the sacrificer.'
Zarathushtra speaks of himself as a zaotar in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

zaotar, he seeks the vision of Ahura Mazda and longs
to hold communion with him.49 The food offered as a

ceremonial offering is <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> in the Avestan texts as

offer myazda with homage <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Ahura Mazda and
Asha.50 He alludes once to draonah [=dron], 'the
sacred cake,' which forms an indispensable article of
offering in the later period. He speaks of it probably
in the sense of the ambrosia and asks Haurvatat and
Ameretat to confer it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> him for ever.51

DRUJ
Her Kingdom of Wickedness. The Rig Veda speaks
of a minor demon Druh who with <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> of her class
stands for malice or hatred. The corresponding
Gathic term is Druj, 'falsehood or wickedness.' The
Daevas are generally malevolent male beings. Druj,
on the other hand, is a female fiend. The Gathas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span>

Zarathushtra's Gathas.4 All precepts in the sacred
stanzas are generally accompanied by a repeated

next world, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Men</span> of elevated minds <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> hold that it is
not a high moral standard in which an individual
practises virtue in the hope of reward and eschews
vice for fear of retribution. But to be entirely
disinterested in the acting of righteousness, or to

And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> up of saints.

activities of mankind. The saintly type of virtue is the
goal which humanity feebly attempts to reach.
Humanity, as a whole, is evolving towards this ideal
type of virtue, but meanwhile — and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> this be

embracing righteousness is the hope of future reward,
and that of shunning wickedness is the fear of
retribution. In <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> affairs we have to be content
with getting something less than ideal.
It is no wonder, then, if we find an elaborately
worked out system of rewards and retributions in the
ethical code of the sacred hymns. The faithful

Brahmanism. The millennium that followed the
advent of Zarathushtra witnessed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> creative
period of religious and philosophical <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in the
world. Beginning with Zoroastrianism, it gave rise to
Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jainism in India, which

present day. In addition, it developed Judaism in
Palestine, and Taoism and Confucianism in China.
When the Indo-Iranians separated, members of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
group settled in the Panjaub and produced the hymns
of the Rig Veda. Their descendants, who had by this
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> moved towards the plains of the Ganges,
created the Brahmanas and the Upanishads. Apart
from Buddhism and Jainism, which arose in the
middle of this period of religious and philosophical
efflorescence, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> distinguish at least four stages
of religious evolution, namely those of the Vedas,
Brahmanas, Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita.

These periods do not exclude but overlap <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>
another. The Vedic period continued for a
considerable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> into that of the ritualistic
Brahmanism, and the Brahmanic into that of the
philosophic Upanishads and the Upanishad period
projects into that of the religion of the Bhagavad
Gita.
The Brahmans officiated at the sacrifices and
conducted religious services for the laity. They
propitiated and placated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> with libations and
sacrifices and penances to win magical power. When
the Vedic language and literature became antiquated,
the Brahmans interpreted and amplified the ancient
texts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> arose the Brahmanas dealing with
sacrificial texts based on the authority of the Vedas.
The Vedic poets had weaved religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> in the
garb of beautiful lyrical poetry. Their descendants
were now preoccupied in formulating elaborate
ceremonials and sacrificial rites. Symbolical
significance was attached to their punctilious
performance. Rites and ceremenies [116] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to be

have magical potency and were supposed to heal

equally great. The gods, it is said, were originally
mortals and dreaded death, but later won immortality
by sacrifices. Sacrifice, it is added, enables the
Brahmans to compel the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to do their will.
Ritualism <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> rose to a pre-eminent position. Burnt
offerings and sacrifices were believed to procure
earthly gifts and heavenly bliss and to raise the estate

of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> in the next world. Exhortations for moral

animal sacrifices became the central feature of
religion.
Such elaborate ceremonies performed and sacrifices
offered by a specialized priestly class satisfied the
religious needs of the masses of people. The chanting
of the sacred formulas, the sound of bells and
conches, the odour of the burning incense and of
burnt offerings, descended soothingly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the

But there were some persons of a deep devotional
disposition whom dreary ritualism and magical
incantations which superseded a religion Qf morality,
did not satisfy and they yearned for higher personal
religious experience. They longed for passionately
plunging into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the spirit. Such persons
aspired to live religion in their own persons, to
approximate the object of their devotion, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> their

fleshy frame, and the flesh seemed to them to be
antagonizing the spirit. Beneath their calm exterior,
they often experienced the tempest raging <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> and

practice~ to drill and discipline, control and subdue
their unruly bodies. They left their homes and retired
to the forests. They practised various kinds of

austerities, [117] flagellated themselves, emaciated,
tortured, and mortified their bodies by rigorous
devices. They laboured to induce ecstatic state by

acknowledged it as an aid in its [118] need or as a
handmaid to amplify and elucidate its preachings.
Philosophers have stood as a class by themselves.
Their systems of <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> have been recognized as

this father-god by the impersonal world-soul. They

The religion of devotion. Krishna Vasudeva, a
member of the warrior caste, founded Bhagavatism,
the religion of bhakti, devotion or love, about the 4th
century B.C. Bhagavatism arose under the influence
of Sankhya and Yoga. Sankhya being an atheistic
system, Bhagavatism allied itself with Yoga.
Concentration of thought, which is Yoga's
fundamental concern, was converted into devotion to
a personal God. This personal God, whom he termed
the Adorable One, was the objective of man's
devotion and love. This doctrine is later propounded
in the Bhagavad Gita, or the Song Celestial,
originally composed in the 2nd century B.C. and

surviving in its later redacted form. In transcendent
beauty and elegance of form, this philosophical poem
is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the sublimest that have been vouchsafed to

IRAN GOES BACK TO INDO-IRANIAN

The Indo-Iranian cult passes under the mantle of

penetrate into Western Iran, where the cult of the
Indo-Iranian divinities had a strong hold over the
minds and hearts of the people. Mithra occupied the
pre-eminent position <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> them, with the nonIranian Anahita as the close <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> in importance.
Ahura Mazda outshone Mithra with his transcendent

had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> with profound prestige as his cult was

easily acclaimed as the most incomparable divinity

supreme God.
The stronghold of Zarathushtra's religion was Eastern
Iran. His religion was a reform of the primitive faith
of the Iranians. But the reform did not last long,
owing to the counter-reformation that followed his
death. The excellence of his highly ethical religion
was indelibly imprinted on the minds of the cultured
classes, but it had not reached the masses. They

prophet, whereas they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it easy to invoke Mithra
and his heavenly associates with elaborate rituals and
sacrifices. Their veneration for these older divinities,
now in exile, had not ceased. They viewed the
movement of the revival of the Indo-Iranian faith

result that the successors of [126] the prophet were

in the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> household of Ahura Mazda. Mithra was

<span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> compatriots secured the privilege of sharing the
homage and adoration of mankind with their
heavenly sovereign Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda and

quarter before the fall of the Achaemenian empire.

Magi were the recognized class, he, with the other
writers that followed him, acquainted the West with
the Magi. The athravans, the real custodians of the
Avesta and the guardians of the Zoroastrian symbol of
fire, are unknown to these writers. This <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be due

to the fact that Eastern Iran, which was the home of
the athravans, had politically declined, and the
writers are mainly concerned with the Persians of the
west, and their immediate predecessors, the Medes.
The Avestan texts do not recognize the Magi. The
forms derived from the term maga, 'great' occurring in
the Gathas and the Later Avesta do not represent this
priestly class. We find a solitary passage, presumably
a late interpolation, which pronounces a curse <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span>

THE YOUNGER AVESTAN RELIGION
From the Gathas to the Later Avesta, a retrograde
step. We now enter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> field of

atmosphere as we proceed. The buoyant <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the
Gathic hymns is preserved to a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> extent in the
composition of the Haptanghaiti, or the section to
'Seven Chapters' in the Avestan Yasna, <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in the
Gathic dialect during the transition period that
intervened between the close of the Gathic age and
the opening of the Avestan period. The lofty tone of
the earlier compositions gradually declines, and the
greater <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Yasna, Yashts, and Vendidad

becomes heavy and monotonous. On only rare
occasions do the texts exhibit sudden flashes of
transcendent beauty and devout fervour. The
growing tendency is for complexity and
concreteness. The Gathas generally dealt with the
abstract concepts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the Amesha Spentas,

Haurvatat, that of perfection, have each a Yasht

in the thoughts of their composers than do the
primary qualifications. Rather than dealing with the
righteousness of Asha Vahishta and the perfection of
Haurvatat, the later texts expatiate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> their healing

honoured more than the Amesha Spentas. The angels
Anahita and Tishtrya, Mithra, and Verethraghna
figure more prominently than the archangels Vohu

Some of the longest Yashts, or sacrificial hymns, are
composed in their honour. The Yasht dedicated to
Mithra, for example, is eight times larger than the

The archangels, who are higher in the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
hierarchy, who occupied a unique position in the

because mankind do not propitiate him with
sacrifices as they ought to. If they did so, Tishtrya

complains of man's occasional neglect of his

is terrible when angered. Unless <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> appeases his
wrath by abundant sacrifices, he punishes his

Ahura Mazda invokes his heavenly ministers for
help. In the Gathas we saw Ahura Mazda cooperating and holding conferences and working in
consort with his heavenly subordinates. The Younger
Avesta gives a picture of a step in advance in this
direction. Here Ahura Mazda is often depicted as

Tradition places the Golden Age of China in about 3000 B.C. But the
authentic historical records do not go beyond a millennium before the
Christian era. It is in this period that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religious and social ideals were

harassed by feudal warfare, and famine and pestilence worked havoc, adding
to the misery of the people. Perplexed at the visitation of misfortunes and
calamities, wail goes up to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span> from a poet in the eighth century B. C.

mankind. Such complaints are <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> drowned in the chorus that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Heaven</span>

In the
metrical sections of the Younger Avesta the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> elements are sometimes <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span>

the Supreme Being, but in the prose compositions the collocation Ahura
Mazda generally occurs as a compound phrase. In the formation of
compounds, however, either Ahura or Mazda alone is <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> for the sake of
convenience. The Ahura compounds such as Ahura-dhâta, 'created by Ahura,'
Ahura-tkaesha, 'of the faith of Ahura,' or the adjectival <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> âhuiri, 'of Ahura,'

Similarly, the Mazda
element in the compounds Mazda-dhâta, 'created by Mazda,' Mazda-yasna,
'worshipper of Mazda,' Mazdo-frasasta, 'taught by Mazda,' Mazdo-fraokhta, or
Mazdaokhta, 'spoken by Mazda,' invariably stands for Ahura Mazda himself.
Ahura Mazda is the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> object of worship. Ahura Mazda still holds
sovereign sway over both the worlds; his authority in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> of
righteousness is undisputed, and his imperial <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> is unchallenged. He is the
greatest and the very best of the angels.1 The <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Persian Inscriptions speak
of him as the greatest of the divinities.2 The archangels and angels dutifully
carry out Mazda's orders. Reverence for him has <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> abated, and adoration
of him does not languish with the advent again of the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> Indo-Iranian
divinities. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> the dual divinities Varuna-Mitra who received joint
invocation during the Indo-Iranian period, Ahura-Mithra or Mithra-Ahura

From the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span>
of Thales (about 600 B.C.), the head of the school of Miletus, the Greek
thinkers were in touch with the Orient. The Ionians were in close contact
with the Persians. Pythagoras, we have seen, was believed by the classical
writers to have been the pupil of Zoroaster, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> several centuries
intervened between them. Numenius of Apamea <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> that Pythagoras and
Plato reproduce the ancient wisdom of the Magi and Brahmans, Egyptians
and Jews. Alexandria became later a cosmopolitan seat of learning, and the
intellectual East and West met there. It was here that Judaism and afterwards
Christianity were Hellenized. The wisdom of the East was held in high
esteem at Alexandria. Persian influence, it seems, had been felt in Greece in
the early formative period of its philosophy. Zarathushtra, we have noticed,
postulated a quasi-independent <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> intermediary between the godhead and
the universe, Anaxagoras calls it nous, acting between God, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as
the regulating principle of existence. Plato <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> in his Timaeus that the
universe becomes an organism through the universal World-Soul that is
created by the Demiurge, the Supreme Deity. The <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Testament Tefers to
the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of Yahweh.1 Philo Judaeus unites the Greek and Jewish ideas about
Logos and <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> that Logos is the first-born <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Son</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> and acts as a

Idea of the Good, because, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Spenta Mainyu, he is creatively active. In
common with Spenta Mainyu, Logos is not a personal being, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Spenta

times seems to be an attribute of God. The Avestan texts refer to Spenta
Mainyu and his adversary Angra Mainyu as thworeshtar or the fashioners [159]
or cutters and, speaking about the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Logos, Philo speaks of him as
Tomeus, 'the cutter,' employing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of the same meaning. Again as

darkness, so Logos, <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> Philo, is the Shekinah or Glory or <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> of God, but

creature reveals only half the creator and hides the other half. In the <span class="t25 hoverable">Book</span> of

1. Genesis 1.2. The relation between Ahura Mazda and his <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">Holy</span> Spirit. It
remains as subtle in the Younger Avestan texts as it was in the Gathas. We
have already seen in the treatment of this highly abstract concept, as it is
portrayed in the Gathic texts, that the term Spenta Mainyu either designated
Ahura Mazda as his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> attribute, or occurred as a being separate from the
godhead. The Later Avestan texts, it seems to us, lead us to the idea that
Spenta Mainyu has no independent existence apart from Ahura Mazda, in
other words, as shown above, he is not a personal being. The Later Avesta,

moreover, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> in the subsequent pages, teaches that all earthly
and heavenly [160] beings, belonging to the Kingdom of Goodness,
including Ahura Mazda himself, have their Fravashis, or Guardian Spirits.
Spenta Mainyu alone in the realm of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> his Guardian Spirit.
Furthermore, Spenta Mainyu does not receive homage and invocation from

ASHA VAHISHTA
The formation of the name. The Younger Avesta, in conformity with the
Gathas, calls this archangel Asha and adds the epithet vahishta or 'best' to the
name. The variant stem arta is, however, <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> as an element of Astvatereta,

is most consistently developed throughout the entire subsequent literature. It
is the favourite theme on which, the Zoroastrian theologians are <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> tired
of expatiating. Purity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is the most salient feature in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of a
Zoroastrian. It is rated higher than anything else. The problem of cleanness
and uncleanness, purity and impurity, has evoked an extensive literature. The
tenets of the faith in this respect have been worked out into a science of
health. Bodily purity is indispensable to purity of mind. Cleanliness of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span>
is an essential requisite for saintliness. The clean in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> find it easy to be

Asha Vahishta comes to be regarded as the healing <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of bodily

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> healer is the best one; it is he that heals the faithful through his own
righteousness by <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of the utterance of the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> spell.95
95. Yt3.6; Vd7.44. Asha Vahishta's relation to fire. We have seen in the
Gathas Asha's dual association with the universal <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> prevailing
everywhere and fire. We find these early Zoroastrian conceptions reflected
in the writings of the Greek philosophers of the period. Heraclitus, who
flourished at Ephesus, near the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the sixth century B.C., postulates <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span>

Angra Mainyu, as the devil, exclaims that Zarathushtra burns him with Asha

KHSHATHRA VAIRYA
The change that the concept undergoes. The Gathic Khshathra now takes
Vairya, 'desirable,' as its standing epithet, and hence both the terms combine

gradually loses the abstract side of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in the Avestan texts. In the
Gathic prose <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> of the Yasna Haptanghaiti the abstract idea of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span>
Kingdom occurs but once. In this solitary passage the devout <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> for the
everlasting Kingdom of Ahura Mazda.100 Throughout the Younger Avestan
texts this abstract idea of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> kingdom recedes into the background,
or rather is entirely lost sight of. True, Khshathra Vairya is still occasionally
invoked by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> along with the other celestial beings, but his higher

Vairya and the molten metal are invoked side by side.101 In fact he very soon

riches. He generously bestows his possessions on the poor. He is sometimes
invoked in company of marezhdika, 'mercy,'104 who is styled the protector of
the poor. We can trace this relation of Khshathra Vairya as the merciful
helper of the poor to the Ahuna Vairya [Ahunwar] formula.

comprehensive title of vispe Yazata, "all Yazatas,"13 Closely corresponding to
the Vedic vishve Devâh, 'all Divinities.' In fact an entire <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> of the ritual is

called, adds the commentator, because they can be seen by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> with his

divinity of religious wisdom, has a personality that is sharply defined. Her
standing epithets are 'good' and 'most upright.' She is the most upright,
holy, bearing libations, wearing a white garment as her emblem.59
Zarathushtra longs to own her and devoutly implores her to grant him,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> other things, the clearest vision.60 The prophet's noble consort

her supplicants, asking various boons, which she grants to those who are
pure in heart.61 The faithful <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to approach Ahura Mazda through the

to propitiate the archangels.68 From his battles against the demons, he
returns victorious to the celestial assembly of the archangels.69 His dwelling
is supported by a thousand pillars, is self-lighted from within, and starspangled from without.70 He drives <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> in a heavenly chariot drawn by four
white shining horses that are fleeter than the winds, fleeter than the rain,

Vairya [Ahunwar] and the other consecrated spells are his weapons.73 His

swiftest, and the most awe-inspiring of youths.77 He is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> incarnate,
the valiant wielder of the club, which is levelled against all demoniacal
powers, especially against the fiendish Druj.78 He is courageous, mighty,
swift, powerful, terrible, and heroic.79 He is a formidable foe to the wicked.
He is not afraid or anyone, but the demons tremble at his sight and flee to
the region of darkness.80 His mace does havoc on them. He is the warrior of
the strong arms, who breaks the skulls of the demons.81 Himself
unconquerable, he is the conqueror of all.

function, as we have seen above, that the Gathas allotted him. The Younger
Avestan texts speak more of his all-absorbing <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of combating the
demons. In the Gathas he preached devout submission to Mazda's mandates;

against the mischief of Bushyansta, who lulls it to sleep.90 With his terrible

prominent figure. As an associate of Varuna, Mithra's individuality was
eclipsed during the Indo-Iranian period. After the separation of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
groups of the Aryan people, Mithra rose to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> eminence, and was the
premier divinity in Western Iran, when Zarathushtra preached his religion.
During the period of syncretism after the passing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> of the prophet,
Mithra became the most conspicuous angel of the Younger Avestan period.
The longest Yasht, which is eight times longer than the Yasht composed in
honour of Ahura Mazda, celebrates his greatness. He is the most masculine,
exacting, implacable, and relentless of all the Yazatas. Ahura Mazda has
created him the most glorious of the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> Yazatas,105 as worthy of
<span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> and prayer as himself.106 The description of him in the Yasht that is
dedicated in his honour gives a vivid picture of the character of the preZarathushtrian divinities that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to be worshipped in Iran. Mithra was the
most eminent of the primitive Ahuras, as he was conjointly worshipped with
Ahura Mazda.107 The writer who consecrated Yasht 10 in his honour was
conversant with the past greatness of this divinity, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> cult had struck so
deep a root in the popular mind. He certainly was unsparing in eulogizing
the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of this genius in the universe. The texts sometimes speak of Mithra
in terms that are usually applied to Ahura Mazda, and the latter [184] himself
is represented in this particular Yasht as having sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Mithra.108
The heptad of the Amesha Spentas having been already complete, Mithra is

not raised to the rank of these higher beings. but is assigned a <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>
the Yazatas. The <span class="t25 hoverable">Old</span> Persian Inscriptions of the Achaemenian kings mention
a very limited number of the celestial beings. Mithra occupies a prominent

most glorious of all the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> Yazatas.111 The composer of the Yasht who
sings to his favourite divinity applies to him the same honorific epithets as
are applied to the godhead. Mithra is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> omniscient, which is strictly

and are invoked for special help.124 Mithra is again jointly invoked with
Hvarkhshaeta, the angel presiding over the sun. This is natural, because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

Mithra protects truth. Consequently at an early date he is associated with

At a very early date Mithra was styled the warder of truth. <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Light</span> is

Mithra, as portrayed in the Avestan texts, we gather more information of his

RASHNU
Personification of truth. This angel is preeminently genius of truth. His
standing epithet is razishta, 'most upright'. To adopt the phraseology of the
Younger Avestan texts, Rashnu is the most holy, the most well-shaped,
exalted, courageous, most knowing, the most discerning, the most foreknowing, most far-seeing, the most helping, the greatest smiter of thieves
and bandits.l96 He is as bright as the fire.197 Zarathushtra blesses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>

Aryan Glory. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> Sirozah passages (1.26, 2.26) Mount Ushidarena

VERETHRAGHNA

courageous in courage, the most victorious in victory, the most glorious in
glory, the most abounding in favours, the best giver of welfare, and the most
healing in health-giving.215 He is the giver of manliness, inflicting death,

invoked along with Daena, the genius of religion, and Vohu Manah's

evil, exorcises those possessed of the demons, and heals the sick; he is
consequently invoked to heal the ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and

repel evil. The Airyaman Ishya prayer is generally repeated four times. The
most frequently occurring formulas that are repeated in various numbers, as
the occasion demands, are the Ashem Vohu and the Ahuna Vairya. They are
generally <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> at the opening or at the close of all prayers. The number of
times which they are recited varies from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to a hundred thousand, or to be

AIRYAMAN
The genius of health. This Indo-Iranian divinity originally conveys the idea
of comradeship and occurs in the Vedas as a groomsman at the wedding rites
and casually in the Avesta in connection with the wedding rites. The Fiftyfourth <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of the Yasna is consecrated to Airyaman. He is invoked to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down to the wedding for the joy of the faithful.284 In regard to
attributes <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to Airyaman we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> add in this connection that his standing
epithet is 'the beloved one.' 284 Y54.1.
But Airyaman plays a more prominent <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in the Iranian literature as the
genius of health. He is an acolyte to Asha Vahishta, and is invoked <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span>
with him.285 The third Yasht, which bears the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of Asha Vahishta, is, in
fact, mostly devoted to Airyaman. Ahura Mazda created this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> immune
from any sickness and disease, but the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> introduced therein ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine diseases.286 Ahura Mazda
accordingly sends his messenger Nairyosangha to Airyaman with the request
to go to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> with his healing remedies. Airyaman quickly obeys the
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> command and begins his work.287 He smites and drives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> all kinds
of sickness and death, magic and sorcery.288 Airyaman [204] does not heal by

fact <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the greatest of such sacred formulas, the Airyaman Ishya, as we

HAOMA
The divinity of joint Indo-Iranian fame. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of the most distinctive features
common to the Indo-Iranian peoples before their separation is the HaomaSoma cult. The Avestan Haoma is identical with Vedic Soma, and both refer
to the sacred drink prepared from a special plant and partaken of as a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of
the ritual service. Haoma has secured a prominent <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the later Avestan
theology and forms an essential <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the Zoroastrian liturgy. Haoma
primarily is a plant of this world, from which the drink was quaffed as a
religious act, but the idea soon evolves into an angel of the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span>
presiding over this plant. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> concepts are so closely interwoven that it
often becomes difficult to ascertain whether the Haoma occuring in a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span>
passage is the genius of the plant of that name, or the plant itself. The same
difficulty is witnessed with reference to Soma in the Vedas. The
anthropomorphic character of both Haoma Soma is little pronounced. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Three</span>
chapters of the Yasna and a Yasht mostly composed of excerpts from the
Yasna are dedicated to Haoma. More than 120 hymns are devoted to Soma
in Rig Veda. Ahura Mazda <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> for Haoma the star-bespangled <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>

girdle, that is, the Mazdayasnian religion. Girt with this he dwells on the top
of the mountains,292 and from these heights he sacrifices <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> Drvaspa,

Haoma pleads the greatness of his cult. He is anxious that his cult, which
has been in vogue for centuries, be <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a due [205] <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> faith

approaching Zarathusbtra for this particular purpose. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> morning, we are

before the fire-altar and asked him to seek his favour by consecrating the
Haoma juice for libations and to praise him as the other sages had praised
him.294 Vivasvant, Yama, and Trita Aptya were the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span>

a husbandman is not thereafter born in his house.312 The faithful is exhorted
to propitiate him with his due portion, lest the offended angel should bind
him with heavy iron chains as he bound Franrasyan.313 Haoma pronounces
his curse of being childless and of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> and fame against those who, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>

Ashi's associate. Parendi, as the female genius of riches, plenty, and activity,
is identical with the Vedic Puramdhi, the goddess of plenty. She is the
constant companion of Ashi Vanghuhi, and is invoked with her.359 She is
active in thought, active in word, and active in deed, and gives activity to
man's body.360 She moves about in a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> chariot.361 As the impersonation of

DRVASPA

The female genius of cattle. She is a female genius of the animal world. As
the guardian of herds, she is invoked in company with Geush Tashan and
Geush Urvan.364 A Yasht (9) is consecrated to her and bears her name, or
more familiarly that of Gosh or Geush Urvan. Drvaspa moves about in her
own chariot of sounding wheels. Mazda has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> her heroic and righteous.

Her sacrificers. The Yasht gives a list of her supplicants who have asked her
to grant them various boons. They are the same persons that invoke Ashi
Vanghuhi and pray for the same boons that they ask from her. The only
difference between the [211] forms of invoking Drvaspa and Ashi is that no
offering is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to Ashi by any of her supplicants, whereas in the case of

faintly pronounced both in the Rig Veda and in the Younger Avestan texts.

praise of the dawn in about twenty hymns. There is only a short Avestan
hymn in prose composed to celebrate the dawn and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> this has but six

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the same name. The Tishtrya Yasht (8) sings the glory of the twofold
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of Tishtrya, both as star and as the Yazata that presides over it.
Tishtrya is, therefore, the rain-star, and the Yasht gives a lively picture of his
movements in producing clouds and rain and sleet, and distributing them
over all the world. Tishtrya's constant companions are the starYazatas,
named Vanant, Satavaesa, and Haptoiringa, as guardian spirits of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
regions of the heavens.406 The thirteenth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of the month406a and the fourth

VAYU

The deification of the wind. Vayu, or Vata, is the Indo-Iranian
impersonation of wind. The terms Vayu and Vata are variously <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to
represent either the wind or the genius of wind in both the Rig Veda and in
the Avestan texts. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Yet</span> Vayu is chiefly the personification of the wind. As we
have already seen, the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> of the Ram Yasht treats of the exploits of

the darkest places to smite the demons.433 He is high-girt, of strong stature,
of high foot, of wide breast, of broad thighs, and of powerful eyes.434 He
wears a golden helm and a golden crown, a golden necklace, and golden
garment; he has golden shoes and a golden girdle; and armed with golden
weapons he rides in a golden chariot rolling on golden wheels.435 A fine
image this, to immortalize Vayu in a golden statue! The poet gives a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> list
of the names of Vayu, and is very prolific in ascribing high attributes to him.
In this the ancient composer follows the Yasht dedicated to Ahura Mazda. In
fact Vayu is the only angel who is known, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Ahura Mazda, by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span>
names. The <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> enumerates about forty-seven of such titles. Almost all of
these attributes of Vayu are derived from the function of Vayu as wind,
rather than from his activity as the genius of wind. They pertain to the
atmospheric phenomenon more than to the abstract ideas about the angel.
Some of the more important of the names of Vayu are as follows: the
overtaker, the all-vanquishing, the good-doer, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> going forwards and
backwards, the destroyer, smiter, usurper, the most valiant, the strongest, the
firmest, the stoutest, the vanquisher at <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> stroke, the destroyer of malice,

the battle, or when the tyrant and heretic threaten him with their havocking
hordes.

What causes grief to Atar. Angra Mainyu has created the inexpiable crime of
burning or cooking dead matter,478 and the Vendidad enjoins capital
punishment for those who commit it.479 We are informed that the Persians

divinity of the waters. She resides in the starry regions.493 This deity of the
heavenly stream gets recognition of the Achaemenian kings, and is included
in the extremely short list of the Iranian divinities expressly mentioned in
their inscriptions.494 Classical writers speak of her sanctuaries founded at
Pasargadae, Ecbatana, Kangavar and other places.495 At a very early date her
cult migrates to distant countries and is there assimilated to Artemis,
Aphrodite, Athene-Minerva, Hera, Magna Mater, Ishtar, and Nanaia.496 She
overleaps the barriers [226] of Mount Alburz and gains her votaries in the
far-off lands of East and West, where occasionally her cult degenerates into
obscene rites. Herodotus who confuses her with Mithra <span class="t1 t7 t9 t14 t15 t17 t25 t28 hoverable">says</span> that her cult
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to Iran from the Semites of Assyria and Arabia.497 493 Yt5.85, 88, 132.

maiden of fair body, well-shaped, pure, courageous, tall, bright, beautiful,

Ahura Mazda heads the list of the sacrificers who entreat her for various

boons. The Yasht dedicated to Ardvi Sura Anahita furnishes us with the
names of those who have sacrificed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> her and begged of her various
boons. The number of her supplicants exceeds that of any other angel. Ahura
Mazda and Zarathushtra invoke her, with Haoma and Baresman, with spells
[227] and libations, whereas the majority of her other votaries severally offer
her a hundred stallions, a thousand oxen, and ten thousand sheep.
Haoshyangha, Yima, Thraetaona, Keresaspa, Kavi Usa, Haosravah, Tusa,
Vafra Navaza, Jamaspa, Ashavazdah, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Pourudakhshti, and
Ashavazdah and Thrita, the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> of Sayuzhdri, Vistauru, Yoishta, the
members of the Hvova and Naotara families, Vishtaspa, and Zairi-vairi are all
granted their diverse boons. These ask for sovereignty over all countries,
victory on the battlefield, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to smite the adversaries in battle, to rout the
sorcerers and fairies, the fiends and the demons; they pray likewise for bodily
health, wisdom to answer the riddles of heretics, and for riches and swift
horses.505 The boon that Ahura Mazda seeks is that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> win over
Zarathushtra to think after his reljgion, to speak after his religion, and to act
after his religion; the prophet in turn begs of her that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> gain to his side

and chiefs invoke her that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> defeat their enemies and smite the
demons, sorcerers, and fairies, the warriors beg of her swift horses and bodily
health and glory, the priests and their disciples pray for knowledge, the
maids beseech her to grant them strong husbands.507 Ardvi Sura Anahita
bestows fruitfulness to women; she purifies the seeds of all males and the
wombs of all females for bearing. Shes, as a <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> bestower, gives easy
childbirth to all females, and gives them <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> and timely milk.508 Ardvi Sura
likewise grants boons <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> all, because it lies in her <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> to do so.

sacrificing priest implores her to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down from the stars to the sacrificial

She reluses to concede the wicked persons their wishes. Azhi Dahaka
wickedly besought her to grant him a boon that he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> all the seven

The offerings of libations. Ardvi Sura Anahita desires that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> invoke her
with libations and Haoma;512 these libations are to be drunk by the priest
who is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> versed in religious lore, and not by any wicked and deformed
person.513 The faithful are to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> libations <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">unto</span> her at any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> between
the rising and the setting of the sun. Those <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to her after sunset do
not reach her; on the contrary, they go to the demons, who revel in these
misdirected offerings.514 We are informed that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who dedicates these
libations before sunrise or after sunset does no better deed than if he should
pour them down into the jaws of a venomous snake.515 Besides invoking
Ardvi Sura Anahita as the Yazata of water, the waters themselves are
collectively invoked to grant boons. Zarathushtra is asked to offer a libation
to the waters and to ask from them riches, power, and worthy offspring,516 a
happy and a joyful abode in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the next, accompanied by riches

Animal sacrifices to Anahita. Strabo relates the mode of sacrificing to the
waters. The sacrificial animal, we are told, is <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> to the bank of a river or a
lake; a ditch is formed into which the animal is killed. The pieces of meat are
then placed on myrtle or laurel, and holding tamarisk twigs in his hands, the
priest pours oil mixed with honey and milk on the ground and chants the
sacred formulas. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> care is <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> that no drop [229] of blood falls into the

Any defilement of the waters evokes Ardvi Sura's displeasure. It is sinful to
contaminate the waters.

The earliest non-Zoroastrian writers speak of
Zoroastrianism as the religion of dualism. Early
Greek writers, who, we can safely assert, were
contemporary at least with the Later Avestan period,
speak of the religion of lran as based on the belief in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival spirits. Hippolytus relates, on the authority
of Aristoxenus (about 320 B.C.), that the Persians
believed in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> primeval causes of existence, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

the mother.5 On the authority of Diogenes Laertius
we have the assurance that Eudoxus and Aristotle
wrote of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> powers as Zeus, or Oromazdes,

DAEVAS
The Demons. The daevas, or demons, are of both
sexes, as are their heavenly counterparts. Over
against the vispe Yazata, or 'all angels,' stand in sharp
contradistinction the vispe Daeva, 'all demons.'42 The
greatest of all the demons is Angra Mainyu,43 who
has created these fiends in opposition to the [262]
Yazatas. The archangelic host of the Amesha
Spentas, and some of the angel band of Yazatas have
each a Daeva as a special adversary engaged in
thwarting the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> will. Plutarch states that when
Oromazdes created the six archangels, Areimanios
counter-created an equal number of fiends.44 The
arrangement, however, is perfunctory, if we examine
the Younger Avestan text. The personality of the
majority of these demons is not sharply defined, and
the account of their activities, as <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the Later
Avestan texts, is very vague and meagre. Some are
mentioned simply by name, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> any account of

only are the wicked spirits spoken of as the Daevas,
but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> the nomadic hordes of Gilan and

confronted by demon Apaosha, who has assumed the
<span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of a dark horse.155 A severe struggle ensues,
lasting for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> nights.

himself on the battlefield the vigour of ten horses,
ten camels, ten bulls, ten mountains, and ten rivers.157
Ahura Mazda, thereupon, offers a <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> to the
unfortunate angel and gives him the desired
strength.158 Girt with this added power, Tishtrya now
boldly marches against his rival, and engages in
combat with him, until, to the joy of the waters, and
plants, and lands, and fields, Tishtrya comes out
triumphant and Apaosha is defeated.159

We have already referred to the probability of the
idea of the intermediary <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> between <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t15 t18 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">heaven</span> and
hell as embodied in the Gathas. The Younger

which is generally <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> to be identical with the wellknown hamistakân of the Pahlavi period.
HELL
Four hells. Simultaneously with the increase in the
number of heavens, there is a corresponding increase
in the list of hells. The Gathas knew but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> hell.
The later Avestan texts speak [287] of four abodes of
the damned. They are those of Dushmata, or <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span>

<span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> Garonmana, and receives the epithet anaghra

achishta anghu, or Worst Existence are designations of

The wicked souls reap in incessant tears the crop
they have sown in the finite world. The gulf of
gloom now yawns for them. The demon Vizaresha
carries off in bonds the wicked souls to their doom.53

CHAPTER XXIX
THE RENOVATION
The greatest of the renovators. Zoroaster in his
religion postulated a renovation of the universe, a
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> dispensation in which the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> will <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span>
perfect at the last day. We learn from Diogenes, on
the authority of Theopompus and Eudemus, that the
classical authors were familiar with the Magian
doctrine of the millennium and the final restoration
1. Prooem. 9.
of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> as early as in the fourth century B.C.1
Plutarch draws his materials on this millennial

doctrine from Theopompus.2 In the Later Avestan
texts we sometimes miss a clear definition of the
collective judgment of the souls and final
regeneration. But they furnish us with some stray
passages which cursorily deal with the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of the
Renovation at the millennium and of the saviour
renovators who will <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> this to pass.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> progresses towards perfection. Inequity
and wrong are to be ultimately supplanted by equity
and right. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to be restored to a veritable

finally be saved. The faithful are confident of this

Saoshyants in the Zoroastrian terminology. The
Fravardin Yasht5 mentions Ukhshyatereta, Ukhshyatnemah, and Astvatereta as the chief renovators.
Zarathushtra's own kith and kin, a superman of
miraculous powers, born in supernatural manner, will

Saoshyant because he will salvage the bodily world,
and Astvatereta because he will save the bodily
creatures from destruction at the hands of the twofooted wicked ones.7 Astvatereta is reflected in the
Gathic expression astvat ashem, ashem being cognate
with areta.8 This Saoshyant par excellence is the most
eminent restorer, he is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> the friend of Ahura

as just stated, incidentally mentions Zarathushtra's
seed as watched over by ninety-nine thousand nine

these in the Avesta contain in embryo the doctrine of
the immaculate birth which is later elaborated by the
Pahlavists.

Disintegration followed almost immediately after
Alexander's death, under the Seleucid satrapies, and
Jess than a century had elapsed before Arsaces
succeeded in founding a strong empire in Parthia
about 250 b.c. We have no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> to ascertain the

Zoroastranism <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> better masters than in the
Seleucids. Mithradates, Tiridates, Rhodaspes, and
Artabanus are some of the names of the Parthian
kings that savour of a partiality for Zoroastrianism.

the early <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> of their empire, at least, the Parthians

Zoroastrianism at the close of the Parthian empire.
The fact that some of the Parthian kings were
favourably inclined to Zoroastrianism did not
succeed in saving the Zoroastrian Church from
falling into decay. Heresies and scepticism were
[297] rampant, it seems, and the priesthood was
steeped in ignorance.22 The language of the Avesta
had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ceased to be a living tongue, and the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> books <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in that language

period is Pahlavi, cognate with Parthava or Parthian,
<span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> heroic. It is an admixture of Aryan and
Semitic. The Aryan element belongs to the Avesta,
whereas the Semitic element is Aramaic, closely
resembling Syriac. The Magi and the Athravans, the
priests of Western and Eastern Iran, who were now
united undertook the translations of the Avestan
<span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> and their explanations in Pahlavi. The
explanations or commentaries are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> âzainti in

MITHRAISM
Mithraism is Zoroastrianism contaminated with
Semitic accretions. Of all the Indo-Iranian divinities,
Mithra attained to the greatest prominence during
this period. The Avestan texts constantly speak of
Mithra as the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> of wide pastures, and Mithra
gathered the largest number of flocks under his
protection in the field of spirit. Iranian in its basic
principles, Mithra's cult was soon surcharged with
Semitic accretions and spread <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> and wide under this

Mithra combats the primeval Bull. His painful

to kill it, as he had previously struggled to kill the
Bull. He causes pestilential scourges and protracted
drought but is baftled in his aim. He then causes a
universal deluge, from which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> man, forewarned by

Mithraic ethics. In Rome, Mithraism is the religion of
the emperors and soldiers and Mithra exalts active,
rigorous, military virtues. He is himself <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> wakeful
and demands wakefulness, agility in his votaries. He
is the divinity of <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> and justice and he guards
them, fights against falsehood and injustice and
requires that his worshippers will practise these
cardinal virtues. Man's chief function in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> is to

the aspirants to the Mithraic mysteries had to
practise strict self-control. The neophytes had to
undergo repeated lustrations and ablutions to cleanse
their souls of sin. They had to live austere lives and
perform elaborate occult ceremonies most
scrupulously. There were seven degrees of initiation
in which the mystic successively assumed the names
of Raven, Occult, Soldier, Lion, Persian, Runner of
the Sun, and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on sacred marks

these seven degrees of initiation to enable him to
acquire wisdom and holiness. Only those that passed
through all the seven degrees became participants in

The Mithraic sanctuaries were in caves and grottoes.

Christianity triumphs over Mithraism. The Jews had

gospel of love. By taking over the Hellenistic-Roman
philosophy, they worked out a rational dogmatic
theology that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> satisfy both the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> and the

The conversion of Constantine to Christianity was a
turning [308] point in the destinies of Mithraism.
The cult ceased to be recognized and was tolerated
to exist. Hostility against it began under his

followed under Julian the Apostate (A.D. 361-363),
who was initiated in the mysteries of Mithra in his
youth and who considered himself under the
protection of Mithra. He openly passed elaborate
purificatory ablutions to wipe out the stains he had
contracted when he had received the baptism and the
communion of Christianity. As soon as he ascended
the throne, he introduced Mithraic worship at
Constantinople and celebrated the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> taurobolia at

394 A.D. extinguished all hopes of its revival by the

Miracles as credentials of a prophet's mission as

are due to man's hunger for the marvellous, his
disposition to believe in the impossible, and his

flourish where childlike innocence, ignorance is

herald his birth and archangels attend his nativity.
Legendary accounts of the miraculous conception
and birth and childhood of Zaratusht supersede the
matter-of-fact information that the Gathas give. The
Pahlavi writers have before them the examples of the
legendary stories of the miraculous incidents
connected with the lives of Moses, Buddha, and
Jesus, circulated in Iran by the followers of these
prophets. It is probable that their writings have been
influenced by these foreign sources.

dedicated a cave to the worship of Mithra and adds

In all ages when everybody lives for himself there is

chose to live for all. From chidhood, kindliness,
sympathy, mercy, and generosity had <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> their

He had boundless sympathy and <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> for all the poor

He had keen
ears for the suppressed sighs and silent sorrows of
suffering humanity. He practised liberality and
generosity, he nourished the poor, and gave fodder
to cattle, he saved the lives of those in peril of losing
it.22 <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">According</span> to the custom of the times,, his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span>

ZOROASTRIANISM AS TAUGHT BY THE PAHLAVI <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">WORKS</span>
Ardashir, a Magus, rejuvenates Zoroastrianism. With the fall of the
Achaeraenian empire were extinguished the last sparks of the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of racial
jealousy between the Medes and Persians. Common hardships and common
sorrows had obliterated all traces of bitter feeling for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> another. The

recognition in the Avesta. It is not so in the Pahlavi period. The Avestan
term athravan remains during this era as a class designation alone, but
magopat, which later becomes mobad, is <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> throughout the Pahlavi
literature, equally as a class designation for priesthood and as a personal title
of a priest to distinguish him from a layman. Significant in this <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> becomes
the fact that although the Persians of <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> had defeated the Medes and their
sacerdotal caste, the Magi, it was now a Magus again that was destined to
revive the national glory of Iran, and restore their ancient faith. The Kingly
Glory of Iran clave to a hero of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Sasan in the province of Fars,1

turned their eager eyes to him for the national emancipation from the heavy
yoke of the foreigners. His was the task of rebuilding the shattered fragments
of the ancient Persian empire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the ruins of the Parthian empire. When
he succeeded in [319] consolidating the various states of Iran into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

thereupon to establish a polity in conformity with the teachings of Zoroaster
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> unite his empire as Church and State. It was through Ardashir
that Zoroastrianism became once more enthroned as the creed paramount,

This greatly
elevated the position of the Zoroastrians at the royal court of Bagdad.
During this period it was that the composition of the Pahlavi treatises was
undertaken with renewed vigour. To the ninth century we owe <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the

Pahlavi to the learned clerics, who continued to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> some slight additions
to the Pahlavi literature up to the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the eleventh century.11
11. West, Pahlavi Literature, in GIrPh. 2. 80. The Pahlavi literature has its
roots in the Avestan soil. The Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> allege that the Avestan Nasks
had perished, but the tradition transmitted orally from <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> and the
fragments of the sacred texts did not suffer the Avestan lore to die out
entirely. The extant Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> contain quotations from Avestan <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span>
that have not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down to us, and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> help to show that the later
writers either quoted from memory or that they had access to Avestan works,
since lost, when they wrote their Pahlavi treatises; or possibly it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> serve to
prove both facts. Nay, some of the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> seem to be wholly or in
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> reproductions of some of the Avesta Nasks, and most scholars agree
with West that the Pahlavi Bundahishn is an epitome of the Avestan Damdad
Nask, that has since disappeared.12 This leads to the probable conclusion
that besides the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> archetype copies deposited in the royal treasuries at
Persepolis and Samarkand, there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have existed other copies of these
Nasks, in full or in part, in private possession or in the more notable firetemples. The internal evidence of some of the most important Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span>
show us that they preserve <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of the material derived from Avestan
sources, which still existed in their days, but has been subsequently lost, and

12. SBE., vol. 5. int. xxiv. The Pahlavi literature is the completion of the
Avestan works. The Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> explain, elaborate, and describe in detail
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> of what is stated in brief in the original Avestan texts. This is the
inestimable value of the Pahlavi literature. A few examples <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> serve to
illustrate this statement. The Avestan texts frequently mention 'the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> of
<span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Long</span> Duration,' a period carved out from eternity as the age for the duration
of the present world, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> no idea, as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the texts have been
preserved, as to the length of this mighty aeon. It is to [322] the Pahlavi
books that we have to turn to ascertain the specific duration of this period,

for the millennial doctrine is recognized but not described in the Avestan
writings that we possess today. It is worked out in full detail in the Pahlavi
works. This fact <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> suggest that the idea originated with the
Pahlavists but such is not the case, for we <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> from Plutarch that
Theopompus, who flourished in the fourth century B.C., or a little before the
close of the Avestan period, was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> acquainted with this doctrine of the
Zoroastrians, and wrote about it in his works.13 13. Is. et Os. 47. The Later
Avestan texts speak of the future judgment, the rising of the dead, the
renovation, but it is the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> that acquaint us with the method of
the administration of justice in the heavenly tribunal and the final restoration
of the universe.
The texts of the Younger Avesta, as noted above, speak of <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> heavens
and hells, but the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> locate them, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> a detailed description
of the area they cover, the boundaries that divide them from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> another,
and the conditions that prevail in them.
The trend of the religious <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of the Pahlavi period. We have
described the change from the Gathic to the Avestan texts as a retrograde
step; the Pahlavi texts are still farther removed from the Gathas. The Gathic
ideal lingers and continues to be admired, but it has ceased to influence. It
evokes praise from the Pahlavi writers, but fails to inspire them with its
abstract tone. Zoroaster is a historical personage in the Gathas. In the Later
Avesta he becomes super-human; but in the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> his personality is
enshrouded by miracles, and he is transformed into a myth. The fascination
for marvels in religion is an unmistakable sign of the times. Christian
bishops, who, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> in the further stage of our inquiry, carried on
inveterate disputes with the Zoroastrian clergy in Persia, based the claim of
the greatness of their own religion on miracles. Perhaps in consequence the
life-story of Zoroaster, as told by the writers of the Pahlavi period, is
similarly stamped with the mark of the miraculous. The Gathas and the
Younger Avesta speak of the prophet's conferences with the Amshaspands,
or archangels, and his communing with them. The Pahlavi texts, as we have
seen, state [323]that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the court of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Gushtasp as the envoys
of Ormazd, to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> proof of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> calling of the prophet. Moreover,
when Zoroaster met Vohuman, he actually saw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and the face of the
archangel, his size, and his garments, and in these celestial conferences with

the archangels the prophet was requested by each in turn to command
mankind to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> due care of the concrete thing under the special charge of
each as an Amshaspand and not the abstract virtue that each impersonates.
Vohuman, for instance, as the genius of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> mind, did not emphasize the
faithful adherence to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> thoughts, but contented himself with reminding
the prophet to teach mankind to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> care of the cattle. Artavahisht, the
genius of righteousness, gave no command to Zaratusht to exhort <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to
follow the path of righteousness, but taught him that the best <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of
propitiating the heavenly <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> was to propitiate his fire. Similarly the other
archangels in these celestial interviews did not hold up as the ideals the
virtues over which they presided, but they inculcated due preservation of
their respective earthly objects. A Pazend penitential prayer, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span>
authorship is attributed to Dastur Adarbad Mahraspand, the high-priest and
premier of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Shapur (309-379 a.d.), mentions the Amshaspands by name,
and exhorts the penitent to atone severally for the sins committed against
them. In <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> case he addresses each archangel in turn and craves
forgiveness for any offence that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> have been committed by ill-treating the
earthly object over which the genius presides. Offences against the abstract
virtues which the archangels impersonate are not meniiored in this treatise,14
and this fact tends decidedly to show that phase of Zoroastrianism in which
abstract ideas were gradually losing in importance, and the concrete side of
the religion was coming out with greater prominence. 14. Pt. 8. This process
of materializing the original abstract concepts reaches its climax in the
eschatological notions of this period. The several heavens and hells, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
the bridge of judgment that leads to them, are now completely materialized.
All the splendours of a royal court with its golden thrones, rich carpets, fine
cushions are transferred to paradise. On the other hand, all sorts of physical
tortures that man's ingenuity can devise prevail in hell. [324] Fifteen hundred
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> separated Zoroaster from the Sasanian period, and a thick veil began to
hide the pristine <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> of his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> religion from his followers.
The Sasanian Church became an arbiter of the faith of Zoroaster. It was
through the Church that the religious teachings filtered into the populace.
During the period of her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> influence, when the State was practically
under her tutelage, the Church rendered a lasting service by her attempts to
reinvigorate the Mazdayasnian faith. She triumphed when she stood for the
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of the religion of Mazda; but she failed when she descended to rigid

formalism, stifled independent inquiry, stigmatized honest doubt as
Ahrimanian, and sought to overrule original thinking by dogmatic assertions.
Religion defeats its own ends when it degenerates into dogmatic theology.
And it was not otherwise in Persia.

touch with the Persians in the sixth century B.C. We have already referred to
the fact that the restoration of tbe temple at Jerusalem was executed at the

in Persia in large numbers from very early times, and had planted their
colonies all over the country. They thrived peacefully and were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span>

general those who contracted matrimonial alliances with Jewish women were
disliked, and the Denkard inveighs in strong terms against the practice of
contracting such unions.14 In the course of time, the Persians and the
Israelites seem to have been sharply divided in religious matters.

Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> denounce Judaism in unsparing terms. The writer of the

to Zohak, the most detested of men, as the originator of the Jewish
scriptures,16 branding elsewhere the Jewish books as utterances of the
demons.17 Seno, a Zoroastrian sage, is reported to have said, in his
admonitions to the kings of Persia, that the sovereign of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> ought to

established their empire. Of all the alien faiths in Persia, Christianity was the
most aggressive. The pertinacious attempt of the Christians to win over
converts to their faith from the ruling nation, often caused shedding of

and Byzantine Rome, which had embraced Christianity. The sympathy of

caused disturbances in Persia. Moreover, the fanatic zeal of the priests on

of the Zoroastrian fire-temples and Christian churches, and the consequent
persecution of the Christians. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> as are the resemblances between the

SECTS
Zoroastrianism split up into a number of sects. As indicated above, the
Zoroastrian church had lost all control over its adherents. Sect after sect
arose, each claiming to interpret the religion of Zoroaster in its own light.1
The fact that numerous sects flourished in Iran at this period is proved by the
frequent allusions to them by Greek, Arabian, Syriac, and Armenian writers.
Shahrastani, as we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> later, speaks of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> sects, namely the

fourteen sects as he witnessed in his <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> in the seventeenth century. Several
of these, he adds, flourished from early times. Unfortunately the accounts of
those sects, which we find in the extant Zoroastrian literature, is very
meagre. Several of them, about which we get some information from the

non-Zoroastrian sources, are not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> mentioned by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> in the Iranian

MANI

The arch-heretic of the Sasanian period. This remarkable <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was born in
the reign of Ardavan, the last of the Parthian kings.16 He received his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
revelation at the age of thirteen, and ultimately claimed to be a prophet, the
very seal or the last messenger of God.17 He began his propaganda under
Ardashir, but worked with greater vigour under Shapur I, who embraced his
faith.18 Manichaeism flourished with varied success [340] side by side with
the state religion until the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when Bahram I ascended the throne. The
teachings of Mani acquired a strong hold over the minds of many, and
threatened to be a powerful rival of the ancient faith. The national <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
rebelled against the encroachment of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> cult, and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> strove to
extinguish the heresy by the exercise of a firm hand. He confronted Mani
with his Dastur, who threw him a challenge that, both of them should pour
molten lead on their bellies, and whosoever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> out unhurt should be
declared to be in the right. This Mani did not accept. Consequently in A.D.
276-277 he was flayed to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> and his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> was stuffed with straw.19 With
the removal of Mani from the field of activity, the Manichaean propaganda
entered <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> its dissolution in Iran, but the seed of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> faith he had
sown did -not remain unfruitful. Despite the heavy slaughter of the
Manichaeans, the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> cult spread from the home of its origin to the <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">Far</span> East,
reaching <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as China, and penetrated <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> into the West in the fourth

somewhat as Persian Mithraism had done before it. St. Augustine was a
follower of Manichaeism before he was converted to Christianity. He was
not able to free himself from the influence of his teachings <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> after he had
joined the Christian Church. He imparted its dualistic philosophy to Christian doctrine.20

Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Syrian Gnosticism. In his

its cardinal principles from Zoroastrianism. The author of Shikand Gumanik
Vijar devotes a <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> (16th) to the teachings of Mani and refutes them.
The subject, however, remains incomplete as the latter <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> is
lost. Some of the more prominent features of Manichaeism, which are
fundamentally foreign to the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of Zoroastrianism, are the ascetic
principles of self-mortification, celibacy, fasting, and the vow of poverty.
Each of these in turn we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> examine from the point of view of

Mani holds matter to be the root of evil, hence self-mortification of the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> is a virtue in his system. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> as composed of matter, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span>
to this thinker, is inherently evil. On this very ground he denies the final
resurrection.25 Manichaeism brands all bodily desires as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> and legislates for
their stifling and killing. Since all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> has its root in the body, salvation is
possible only through the extirpation of bodily desires. Mani's system of
religion becomes quietistic, ascetic, and inculcates only passive virtues. He
taught his followers to abhor all natural pleasures and abandon them. He
strove to extinguish the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the bodily desires. The devout was to begin
by abstaining from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> comfort and from <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> amusement. In spite of this,
temptations assail him on all sides, so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he lives in the midst of earthly
attachments. To adopt a practical image, the centipede does not lose <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> if

He is still overcome by passion, by the [342] desire of wife and child, of
hearth and home. He feels that he <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> liberate himself from the

Accordingly, he breaks his family ties, shuns society, becomes a hermit, and

Zoroaster. Manichaeism extols celibacy as the greatest virtue. For those

initiated in the higher orders Mani advocated celibacy. When the ardent

the case of the clergy and of other righteous persons who aimed at higher

life, it was obligatory that they should be celibates. Zoroastrianism legislates
for the clergy and the laity alike. In Mani's system marriage was a vice for
the priest, a reluctant concession to the layman. <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">According</span> to the religion of

Sacerdotal piety does not tend to celibacy in Iran. It is disapproved for all
and under all circumstances. In no stage of the individual's moral and
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> development is marriage <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> considered as incompatible with
saintliness.

did not live <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> to preach his doctrine, for the prince arranged a banquet for
him and his followers and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> them all to the sword in A.D. 528.

OHRMAZD

The supreme godhead. Ohrmazd is the Pahlavi equivalent of the Avestan
Ahura Mazda in the Pahlavi writings of the Sasanian period and later. The
concept of the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">Highest</span> Being retains its former abstract and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
character in the <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> of the Pahlavi writers. Ohrmazd is what the entire
<span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> is not, and he is not what anything in the universe is. The author of
the Denkard describes him by negatives, and states that Ohrmazd is the
sovereign, and not slave; father, and not child; first, and, not last; master, and
not servant; lord, and not serf; protector, and not protected; changeless, and
not changeable; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> itself, and not acquiring knowledge; giver and
not receiver.1 Radiant and glorious are his standing epithets in the Pazend
prayers. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> presently discuss some of the most prominent of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span>
attributes which the Pahlavi <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> ascribe to Ohrmazd.

Ohrmazd is eternal. Ohrmazd had no beginning and has no end. He alone
is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who is <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> born nor dies.2 His adversary is inferior to him in
this respect, that there will be a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> when he will not exist. Ohrmazd <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
was, is, and will <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> be.3 He is the causer of causes, himself being causeless.4
He is the prime source of existence.5

Ohrmazd is invisible. The concept of the spirituality of Ohrmazd remains
unchanged. He is the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> of Spirits.6 Invisibility is the chief characteristic
of spirituality, and Ohrmazd is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to be invisible.7 He is so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> to the

anywhere.9 When [351] Viraf is escorted by Srosh and Atar to the celestial
court, and presented by Vohuman to Ohrmazd he hears the voice of

Ohrmazd, sees a light, but does not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> him face to face.10 The souls of the
righteous ones <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of Ohrmazd in heaven, and console

Zaratusht is portrayed as sitting by the side of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t22 t24 t27 hoverable">saying</span> to him

<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">Father</span> with his hands. Ohrmazd thereupon tells him that this is impossible,
for, as the godhead, he is intangible.12 A later text, on the contrary, speaks of
Ohrmazd as taking hold of the prophet's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> and giving him wisdom in the

knows all that is to come, and is aware of the final overthrow and <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of his

When Vohuman escorted Zaratusht to the council of the Amshaspands, the

and Vohuman accordingly <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> miraculously to facilitate the birth of
Zaratusht.41 He enters into the reason of the infant,42 and makes the child
laugh immediately at birth.43 When Ahriman lets loose the fiends to destroy
the babe, Ohrmazd sends Vohuman to save it.44 The archangel hastens to
the home of Zaratusht and dispels Akoman, whom he finds there.45 When

be righteousness,47 and Vohuman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> conducted him into the celestial

<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">CHAPTER</span> XL
IZADS
The angels. Izad is the Pahlavi equivalent of the Avestan <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> Yazata, and is
similarly employed as the designation for an angel. These angels are
immortal and invisible;1 and some of them, who were pre-eminently the
genii of the living in the Younger Avestan period, have by this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> been
transferred more particularly to the sphere of the dead. For example, Srosh,
Rashn and Mihr, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> of the most prominent Izads of the Avestan period,
have changed their sphere of activity. In the Avestan period they were the
genii exclusively of the corporeal world, but now they are converted into the
judges of the dead. In the Pahlavi time, the faithful, rather than looking to
them for protection and help in this world, solicit more especially their
favour for the next world. Srosh still retains some of his earthly functions,
but he becomes the genius of the dead first, and of the living afterwards. The
angels Hom and Din have extended their sphere of activity by joining
Tishtar in his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of producing rain.2 <span class="t3 hoverable">Certain</span> qualities that were attributed
in the Avestan texts to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> angel are now loosely ascribed to another.

The Izads are the loving guides and protectors of men. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>
expounded the faith of Ohrmazd to Gayomard, the primeval man;3 and they
are <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> ready to fulfil the behests of Ohrmazd, who has created them for
the welfare of his creatures.4 They most frequently visit the sacred temples
consecrated to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> Bahram.5 They help man,6 and instruct him in
goodness.7 It is through their aid that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> learns to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> God, to dispel

Man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> of them enables him to enter into relationship with his
creator;9 for he is unable to progress morally <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> their assistance.10 If

Through their wisdom, moreover, he becomes illustrious,12 and attains to
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> wealth through them.13 They hasten to help the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who practises

by invoking them.15 It was for this very reason that the prophet Zaratusht
prayed to them to grant him the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> leadership.16 They keep

the Worlds.17 As a physician removes bodily illness, or as a farmer cleans
corn of all impurity, so do the angels remove harm from man.18 They keep
up this relation with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as he practises goodness, but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up

beings in the Avestan period. [370] Meat viands are the special feature of the

sacred feast during the Pahlavi period. The Pahlavi treatise Shayast-laShayast explains what particular parts of a slaughtered animal are to be
specifically dedicated to the various divinities in ceremonies. The angel
Hom's <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> to receive the tongue, jaw, and left eye, recognized by the
Avestan scriptures, remains still undisputed.27 The head and neck, shoulders
and thighs, loin and belly, kidneys and lungs, liver and spleen, legs and tail,

He holds the balance of judgment in the celestial court. This Izad of the
Avesta, who traversed all earthly regions and presided at the ordeals, in

The zeal with which they were approached by the living in the Avestan

both of these <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> faculties, namely, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the Farohar, are

Pazend prayers. When the Sasanians <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to power, the Avesta, the sacred
language of Zoroastrianism, has ceased to be a living tongue. The daily
prayers continued to be recited in the dead language. The need was
evidently felt to supplement the Avestan prayers by some additional prayers
in the vernacular. Dastur Adarbad Mahraspand, the learned high-priest and
premier of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Shapur II, composed such supplementary prayers in Pazend,
and his example was followed by other Dasturs. Several benedictory,
thanksgiving, and expiatory prayers composed during this period have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span>

[401] Druj's work. The wicked deeds of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> further the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of Druj

What puts her to flight. Recital of the <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> spells, the heartfelt expiation on

Ohrmazd has endowed him with the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> whereby to rout them,208

INDAR
Transformation of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> Indian divinity into an execrated demon in
Persia. In the Pahlavi texts Ahriman is represented to have created Indar as
the opponent of ArtaVahisht.211 In Ys. 48.1, Druj is glossed in Pahlavi by
Indar. His personality is again quite ill-defined. He does not personify
Wickedness proper, as the opponent of Artavahisht should logically do in
the dualistic system; but his chief business is to drive the thoughts of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span>

Enemy of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> Kingdom of Righteousness. The business of this
demon is, by introducing tyranny and anarchy into the world, to thwart the
efforts of Shatravar towards establishing the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Divine</span> Kingdom <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> earth.214
He is delighted if the faithful discard their sacred shirts and girdles.215 He

TAROMAT
The demon that dries up the spring of devotion in man. This demon,

NAONGHAS

Taromat's confederate. This demon is identified with Taromat,220 and is
ranked as the opponent of Spandarmad. His Avestan counterpart is
Naonghaithya. He gives discontent to creatures and is delighted when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

TAIREV
The opponent of the archangel of perfection. The demon is the adversary
of Khurdad222 and mingles poison with plants,223 and is rejoiced when <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span>

This demon of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> casts his deadly noose around all. He it is who causes
the painful separation of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> and brings death.230 He casts

When the wicked demon Astovidad strokes a man, he causes lethargy; when
he lays his hands on the sick, he makes him feverish; when he looks the
victim in the eye, with his deadly gaze, he deprives him of life.232 He was
sent by Ahriman in the beginning of <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> to slay the primeval man;233
and <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> since that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> he has been destroying all, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> he knows no

of hell, ready to drag the wicked souls down to the infernal depths, as soon
as they are sentenced to hell by the heavenly judges. When the souls
approach the bridge, he contends with Srosh for their possession.237 He casts
a noose around the neck of all persons. The righteous ones are able to free
themselves from it, but the wicked ones are entangled in it, and are dragged
into the infernal abyss by it.238

ESHM
An impetuous assailant of man. This demon, Eshm,239 who has no bodily

had embraced Zoroaster's faith,248 but Arjasp's ruin followed. Terrible as was

The souls escorted by the genii of their own deeds to the other world. At

fiendish apparition, the Denkard and some copies of the Bundahishn
mention that a beautiful fat cow and a fair garden, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as this damsel, are
met with by a righteous soul, while an ugly, lean cow and a barren desert,
besides the hideous hag, are encountered by a wicked soul.34 The description
of the celestial [411] journey and of the happenings on the way, as <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in
the Menuk-i Khrat, differs a little from the other works. These, in agreement
with the accounts in the Avestan texts, depict the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> as meeting its daena

The bridge provides a wide passage to the pious souls, but confronts the
wicked with its sharp edge. The bridge is guarded by the angels and the
<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> dogs.44 It is broad as a beam and has <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> sides. Some of these are

is so arranged that it presents its broad side when a righteous <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> passes over

Punishments and retributive justice. The souls are generally punished by

souls for the very sins that they themselves had instigated. The degree of
suffering is exactly proportioned to the transgression, and the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of
punishment meted out corresponds in the same manner to the various crimes
committed in this world. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> select only a few instances from the

indulges in secret calumnies in the absence of a person.122 An apostate is
converted into a creature with the head of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of a

All conceivable forms of physical torture prevail in hell. Viraf recounts the
ghastly spectacle he had witnessed in the vision vouchsafed him of hell. The
various kinds of most hideous tortures in hell are so dreadful that the
torments and sufferings in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> dwindle into insignificance before
them; and the worst of earthly calamities and inflictions present but a feeble
and inadequate counterpart of their terror.129 Nay the memory [421] of the
miseries on <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> is the only joy for the unfortunate inmates of hell in
contrast to the torment they have to undergo in the inferno. Viraf relates
that the souls are <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> gnawed by snakes and scorpions, worms and other
noxious creatures, flogged with darting serpents as whips in the hands of
demons, suspended head downwards by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> leg or by the breasts in the case
of women or, again, trodden under the feet of cattle. Iron spikes and wooden
pegs are driven into their eyes; they are <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to stand on hot brass and
compelled to lick a hot oven with their tongues. A brazen caldron is
constantly boiling, and is continually fed by the tens of thousands of
wretched souls flung into it. Miserable as their lot is as they are cooked, it is

made still more miserable by the fact that the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> that burns them <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>

<span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">CHAPTER</span> XLVI
DOWNFALL OF THE SASANIANS, AND THE AFTERMATH
Iran sinks before the hordes of Arabs. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Khusru Parviz, who had
waged the last war in the standing rivalry with the West, heralded the
collapse of the Persian empire. The death-knell of the national greatness had
been struck when with the advent of the weak kings on the throne the
commanders, who felt the allegiance of the army to them rather than to the
<span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> of the king, persuaded the army to revolt. Rival princes strove to
assert their respective rights to the throne. Court intrigues and strifes became
rife. The <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> wars with the Romans in the <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> West and the Eastern hordes

near at home, <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> inroads were facilitated by the unfavourable
geographical position of Persia, had exhausted the national resources. Famine
and plague had extended their ravages over the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> country. Unbridled
luxury, with all its concomitant vices, was imported from foreign lands, and
the simplicity of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> inculcated by Zarathushtra and zealously upheld by the
Dasturs was abandoned. The masses did not escape the contagion of the
luxury and vice of the nobility, and the <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> of simplicity was replaced by a
feverish worship of pleasure. The simple habits fostered by agricultural
pursuits were on the wane; and the entire social fabric of Iran was seriously
dislocated. The springs of patriotism were sapped, and the bravery with
which the Persians of <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> had faced their national foes was weakened. The
age of valour had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to an age of weakness and decay. These causes
aggravated the downfall of Iran and foreshadowed the coming catastrophe,
and there was none to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> out as a saviour in this the darkest period of the
nation's agony, so as to avert the impending ruin. In the midst of this chaos
and confusion, Yazdagard III, the last of the illustrious <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Sasan, sat on
the tottering throne.
Since Zoroaster founded his religion, Persia played her conspicuous [438]

During this <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period when mighty empires rose and fell and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> events

population that led its uneventful, independent life. The pastoral <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span>
were divided into innumerable tribes always at war with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> another. These
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> of the desert were generous and hospitable, active and of rugged virtues.
They were inured to fatigue and scorching rays of the sun. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>

divided.
On a sudden, the greatest and most marvellous revolution of <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> history

burning enthusiasm for <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> mighty cause, the spread of Islam. To their
traditional warlike zeal, he added religious enthusiasm and this combination

destinies of mankind.
Pulsating with the vigour and zeal of youth, and frenzied by the sudden rise
of fortune, the host of these formidable foes overran Iran in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> half of
the seventh century; and the decisive battles of Qadisiya and Nihavand
sealed her fate. The Kingly Glory that had guarded the fortunes of the
nation had flown away, and the star of Islam had risen. The Crescent
superseded the Kava banner, Shahinshah was followed by Caliph, Ohrmazd
was replaced by Allah. Zaratusht gave <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> to Mohammed, the Koran
supplanted the Avesta, and the thrilling cry of the Muazzin from the minaret

Confusion and chaos became rampant. The sufferings wrought on the

Islam under the influence of Abu Muslim during the eighth century. The
Samanid dynasty (a.d. 874-999) is named after Saman, a Zoroastrian noble of
Balkh. He claimed his descent from the famous warrior Bahram Chaubin. He
gave up his faith for the religion of Mohammed. The Zoroastrian <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> of the

The frequent ravages caused by the inroads of the Tartar and Turk, Mongol
and Afghan hordes added to the hardships of the Iranians. Persecutions
checkered their progress. Century after century their number decreased by
repeated conversions to Islam. When Agha Mohammed Khan, the founder
of the Qajar [440]dynasty, laid a siege to Kerman during the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of the
eighteenth century, there were about twelve thousand Zoroastrian families in
that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t16 t17 t18 t22 t23 hoverable">city</span> alone. About a thousand families have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> over to India during

Writing to their coreligionists in India in the fifteenth century, they
complain that <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> since the overthrow of the empire they are living under
such troublesome times that the atrocities of a Zohak, or an Afrasiab, or an
Alexander, pale before what they have been suffering for nine centuries.2
The unfortunate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were denied freedom of thought, safety of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> and

<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> themselves, and struggled to eke out an unhappy existence. They
slept smarting under the indignities inflicted on them during the day, were
haunted by the spectre of persecution in their dreams, and awoke in the
morning with gloomy thoughts of the impending morrow. At best they were
suffered to exist, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not live humanly. This was the veritable iron age
of Zoroastrianism and its followers, spoken of in the Bahman Yasht.
Zoroastrianism had struggled for its very existence during this period in
Persia, and its followers during such troublesome times had to practise their
religious rites by stealth.

Iran had crumbled along with the empire, after the invasion of Alexander the

fell now once more before the devastating fury of the Arabs. Iranian culture
<span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> truly emerged from the shock of this final blow. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> of the most
famous writers who have contributed to the Arabic literature and science
were themselves Zoroastrian converts to Islam or descendants of those who
had embraced Islam in earlier days. We look in vain in the extant Pahlavi
literature for the literary <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> of merit on secular subjects by the
Zoroastrian writers. These have evidently perished. We meet with occasional

extinction. The fall of the Umayyads and the ascendency of the Abbasid
Caliphs in 749, by the help of the Persians, succeeded in supplanting the
Arab supremacy by a Persian power. The Abbasids owed their elevation to
the throne to the [441]Persians, who now rose to <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and influence.

The Zoroastrians got a favourable opportunity of peacefully conducting their

of al-Mamun, (a.d. 813-833). After that era the literary activity appears to
have been arrested, for no original <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> were produced that can be assigned
to the period following. The <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of copying manuscripts, however, was
carried on up to modern times, and it is owing to the zealous activity of
faithful adherents to the <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> that the ancient <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> have reached us.

insufficiency of the data prevents us from forming any very clear opinion
about their beliefs. What little information we have of this period comes

mostly from the Mohammedan writers.
Masudi wrote about a.d. 950 that Avesta <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> as revelation from heaven.

Zendiks, because they based their statements on the Zend rather than the
original Avesta. Al-Biruni, who flourished about a.d. 1000, gives some
scattered information on miscellaneous matters of religious practice, which
he gathered from the Zoroastrians of his day. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> select some points of
interest from his description. The angel Srosh, he notes, is spoken of as the
most powerful angel against the sorcerers, and he visits the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> times
during the night to rout them. It was Srosh who introduced the practice of
Zam-zama, that is, reciting one's prayers with closed lips and emitting
inarticulate sounds or in bAj, as the Zoroastrians do to this present day.

fasting was regarded a sin. The injunction not to fast seems to have been

We have already seen that the religious dissensions during the Parthian and
Sasanian periods had racked the Zoroastrian [443] world. Sects and heresies
had sprung up in consequence. Several of these flourished in Iran for
centuries after the downfall of the Persian empire. Shahristani (a.d. 10861153) in his <span class="t25 hoverable">Book</span> of Sects attests the existence of some of these in his times.
The more prominent of these were the Mazdakites, Zarvanites, and the
Gayomarthians. The latter sect, about which we hear for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> time,
evidently derived its <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> from Gayomard, the primeval man. The followers
of this sect, we are told, believe in an eternal being who is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Yazdan.

The Rivayat literature, a collection of questions and answers on ritual
observances exchanged between the Parsis of India and their coreligionists in
Persia, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, enables us to gain an
insight into the theological beliefs of the Zoroastrians of Persia during that
time, and as these Rivayats were compiled in India, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> recur to them
when we discuss the Indian period.
The Zoroastrian community in Persia, during these centuries lay steeped
in the grossest ignorance and darkness. Although the condition of the
Zoroastrians in their fatherland had been growing more and more precarious,
they still had succeeded, amid chaos and confusion, in maintaining for a
considerably <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> their superiority over their Indian coreligionists in

pages how the Indian Parsis had to look to the Iranians for enlightenment in
religious matters. The learned Iranian Mobad Jamasp, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> from
Kerman to Surat in 1721, <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the state of the <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> of the
Zoroastrian priests in India so low that he resolved to impart religious
instruction to some of the leading high priests during the period of his stay
in the land. The Dasturs of Surat, Navsari, and Broach consequently became
his disciples;11 and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> of these, Dastur Darab, later became the teacher
of Anquetil du Perron. But the times later changed. Zoroastrian scholarship

could not thrive in Persia, as it was able to do under the conditions in India.

It was manifest the pristine purity of the faith had departed with the
greatness and glory of the Iranian nation. The sacred fire, kindled by the
<span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span> prophet in the remote past, was still there, it is true, but the demon Az

Centuries full of hardships intervened before Zoroastrianism gained a real

thirteenth century. The author derives his information from the Pahlavi
sources.2 The writers of this period relate that when Ohrmazd created the
<span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of Zartusht, he attached it to a tree. In later ages, a cow belonging to

happened to eat the dry leaves of the tree. The owner of the cow partook of
her milk and the consequence was that his wife conceived the child Zartusht.

child from the womb and were ready to destroy it and the mother was going
to scream in terror. But Zartusht at once consoled her that <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> untoward

At the moment of his birth, Zartusht laughed aloud.4 The story reached the
ears of the magician Durasarun, who hastened to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of Purshasp and
raised his sword to cut off the child's head but that instant his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span> withered
away. He then ordered the child to be thrown into a pile of kindled wood,
naphtha, and sulphur, but the devouring flame became as cool as <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> and
the child was saved by Ohrmazd. Then the wizard threw the child into a
thoroughfare for the passage of oxen but a leading cow <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the child
between her forefeet and drove off all that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> near, with her horns. Then
Zartusht is exposed in a narrow defile through which horses passed. A mare

In the fourth attempt to destroy the child, it is <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> in a den of ravening
wolves. When a wolf rushed to devour Zartusht, his mouth was sewn up.
The wolves were alarmed and sat near the head of Zartusht <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> nurses. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Two</span>

Persian writers say, was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> under their influence. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he invited them
to a feast at his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and when the feast was over spoke in praise of their
work. Zartusht, thereupon, told his <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> that he should abandon the
erroneous path of the wizards and turn to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> for inspiration. The

Purshasp [451] was <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> incensed at these <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> and heated discussions
ensued between him and Zartusht. Purshasp and the magicians were
vanquished by the future prophet. The magicians left the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> in confusion
and disgrace. They fell ill and soon hurried along to the abode of
retribution.8

When Zartusht reached the age of fifteen he gave up attachment to worldly

Zartusht receives revelation. At the age of thirty, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> Zartusht was
returning with his relations and companions towards Iran. They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to a

crossed over the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> in such a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> that the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> moistened only the soles
of their feet. He then met the archangel Bahman to whom he expressed his
heart's desire. Bahman asked him to close his eyes. On opening the eyes,
Zartusht <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> himself in the midst of the heavenly beings waited on by
celestial virgins. The angels greeted him and he conversed with God, who
taught him all sciences and everything from the beginning of <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> to the
<span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of time. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> Zartusht's request Ohrmazd showed him Ahriman in his

ordeals. On Zartusht's asking him about the symbol of religion, Ohrmazd
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the most excellent emblem was light, from which he had created
the entire <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> creation. Wherever there was any luminous object it was the
effulgence of his <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> light. He instructed Zartusht in the Avesta and asked
him to recite the texts of the <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Gushtasp. Each of the other

towards the court of Gushtasp, when the Prince [452] of Darkness accosted
him on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> with his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> associates. He asked the prophet of Ohrmazd
to conceal the Avesta and turn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> from preaching the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> faith. Zartusht,
in reply, recited a <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> of the Avesta, which confounded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> brood.
Some fled, some dropped dead, and some pleaded for mercy. On his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span>
further, Zartusht met <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> tyrant chiefs and he asked them to embrace his
religion. They heeded not his words. Thereupon Zartusht invoked Ohrmazd
for help and a mighty wind began to blow. The stormy wind lifted up the
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> infidels on high and kept them suspended in the air, where the birds tore
off their flesh with beaks and talons until their bones fell to the ground.
The fame of Zartusht had circulated abroad and it reached the ears of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span>
Gushtasp. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> became anxious to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> prophet of Ohrmazd and
when he heard that the beloved of Ohrmazd was coming, he <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out from
Balkh with a numerous retinue to receive him. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> invited the sages and
philosophers to his court and no less than sixty obeyed the royal command.
When Zartusht entered the council hall he had a blazing <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t29 hoverable">hand</span>
which did not hurt him. He passed the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> and courtiers who
held it by turn in their hands and were, likewise, not hurt. On being asked to
produce a miracle to testify his statements, Zartusht asked molten brass to be
poured on his bosom. This was done four times and there was no trace of
burning left. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> ordered the wise <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> to enter into discussion with
Zartusht. The sages questioned and Zartusht answered. They argued and he
replied. For <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> these sages, who had not their equals in the seven

pertaining to this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> and the next, and Zartusht gave convincing replies,
supported by a hundred irrefutable arguments and a hundred demonstrative
proofs. When he had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> silenced the sages, Zartusht loosed his <span class="t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t15 t19 t20 t23 t25 hoverable">holy</span>
tongue and told the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> that he was the envoy of Ohrmazd who had sent
him with a special mission to the king. The Avesta, the sacred book, was

mysteries of both worlds and everything worth knowing was to be <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> out
from that matchless book. Zartusht concluded by asking the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> to embrace

convinced of the superhuman wisdom of Zartusht and became an ardent
follower of his religion. Tutianush or Niyatus was the other philosopher who
was sent by the eminent sages of Greece to interrogate the prophet about
the tenets of his faith. The distinguished Greek seer was at once convinced

naturally ashamed to enter the assembly of the heavenly souls who are all
clad in fine raiment. The souls are awarded heavenly garments in proportion

to what is consecrated to them by their kinsmen in this world. The richer the
quality of the garment consecrated here, the finer the raiment bestowed

Bull's urine, or golden water, as it is now called, has been an indispensable
article in the purificatory rites and ceremonial ablutions <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the
Zoroastrians from the earliest times. From the strong belief in the efficacy of
its giving external bodily purification, it was but a step to the idea of
attributing to it the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of purifying the internal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> of man. A most
extravagant sanctity <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to be attached to the drinking of it. Elaborate
rituals are now performed over the liquid and the drinking of this
consecrated fluid <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> an indissoluble <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> Zoroastrian
ceremonials. The Rivayats tell us that the drink gives <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> glory, and makes
man's inner <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> as bright and as pure as the sun.
Bull's urine has been, since ancient times, an essential auxiliary of spells or
formulas <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> to exorcise those possessed by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> power; but the original
Avestan and Pahlavi <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> gaomaeza or gomez fell into disuse by the Rivayat
time, and the term nirang, which originally meant spell only, now signifies
both spell and bull's urine, and henceforth conveys both the meanings. Such
in general is the view that we gather from the Rivayats regarding the
conditions prevailing in that period.
Other <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> in Persian. Besides the Rivayats, several works, both in prose
and in verse, have reached us. The most important of these is the Zartusht
Namah or <span class="t25 hoverable">Book</span> of Zartusht composed in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">verse</span> by Zartusht Bahram Pazdu in the
thirteenth [460] century.2 The account of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> of the prophet is based

Avestan texts are translated into Persian with the help of their Pahlavi
version. A considerable devotional literature and treatises on miscellaneous
subjects are extant. There are about forty short prayers in <span class="t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t12 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">verse</span> and gazal

Zartusht Bahram Pazdu, the author of the Zartusht Namah. The latest are
composed in the third quarter of the last century.

The allegorical method of interpreting religious texts. From very early
times some theologians of both the East and the West [462] have maintained
that the prophets adapt themselves to the mode of thinking of the masses
and use parables and legends to express their views. The sacred texts, they

say, are <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> which contains a double meaning, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> is the
surface meaning, which can be understood by the masses, and the other is
the inner or hidden <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> meant for the initiated. The Sophists and Stoics
resorted to the method of allegorically interpreting Greek mythology to
meet the attacks of sceptical criticism. The Alexandrian Jewish and Christian
theologians, Philo and Origen, spoke of the literal and <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> meanings of
the sacred books. The first, they wrote, was the bodily <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> meant
for the majority and the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> was its <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> which was understood
by those few who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> find the revealed kernel, hidden by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the outer
textual shell. The Gnostics and the Neo-Platonists <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> attempted to explain
Oriental and Occidental myths by allegorical interpretation. The Ismailis,
the Sect of the Seven and other schools that flourished in Iran from the ninth
century, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> themselves the Bâtinis or the esoterics as opposed to the
Zâhiris or the exoterics or literalists. Their method of interpreting the sacred
texts on the allegorical basis is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> tâ’wil.
This method of interpreting religious texts persists throughout the various
periods of the history of the religions of the world. Legends and myths,
traditional dogmas and superstitious customs, historical errors and textual
discrepancies, primitive beliefs and practices are all invested with the
mysterious meanings. Statements which often repel both <span class="t20 hoverable">intelligence</span> and
conscience find an easy expedient in allegory. The esoterics generally seek in
the sacred texts what their own thinking is willing to find and read in them
what is rooted in their minds. They read the subjective <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> into the
texts and draw unwarranted implications from them. Forces of nature,
animate or inanimate objects are all <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> and explained as
symbolizing some ethical idea, some aspects of man's consciousness, some
expression of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> in man. Rational explanations are attempted for
apparently absurd customs to preserve them against rational criticism.
Symbolic significance is attached to puerile legends. Unbridled by the
canons of reason and undeterred by any regard for historical sense and
critical acumen, the esoteric interpreters of religions generally produce
allegorizing extravagances.
[463] Desatir and Dabistan. In the early <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the last century appeared

to have been <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> down in the reign of Khusru Parviz and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> to throw a

the appearance of this work. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> party of eminent European scholars
declared it to be a fraudulent forgery, while <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> of equal eminence
endeavoured to prove its authenticity. The claim of the Desatir to have been
<span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in a celestial language was <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> to a crucial test. Patient research has
since declared the <span class="t25 hoverable">book</span> to be an exotic, outside the pale of Zoroastrianism.
And so it has been held by all Iranian scholars both of East and West.1

Some of the most prominent disciples of this recluse sage were the Mobads
Farzan Bahram of Shiraz, Hushiyyar of Surat, Sarosh, and Khuda Jui. They
extravagantly trace their lineage back to Ma-habad, to Sam, Godrej, Rustam,
Jamasp, Zoroaster, and Noshirvan. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us now <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> on to a brief notice of the

Mystic literature during the period. These Parsi mystics composed several
treatises in Persian, which, as we have already seen, was the literary medium
of this period. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the more important <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> that have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down
to us are Jam-i Kaikhusru, Makashefat-i Kaivani, Khishtab, Zaredasht Afshar,
and Zindah Rud. The author of the last <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> allege that their <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> are
translations into Persian from the original Pahlavi books <span class="t23 hoverable">written</span> in the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span>
of the Sasanian kings Hormazd and Khusru Parviz. A search through the
literary content of these writings, however, shows that their philosophical
dissertations mostly reproduce the teachings of Greek philosophy, current in
India in the seventeenth century through its Arabic version. For instance, the
Khishtab opens with the prophet Mahabad's descriptions of the four
generative principles of things, which are <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> else but the material,
formal, efficient, and final causes of Aristotle. The authors fantastically credit
the legendary and real kings and princes of Persia with the philosophical
ideas, which on very little examination can easily be traced to their original
Greek sources. These royal personages are styled prophets or seers and
depicted as advancing some original argument for the proof of the existence
of God, his eternal attributes, and regarding other kindred subjects. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Even</span> the
warrior heroes Zal and Rustam seem occasionally to have proclaimed a truce
to warfare, and to have devoutly sat down in more peaceful pursuit of
metaphysical investigations; for some of the philosophical disquisitions stand
in their names too.
[466] The alleged twofold <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> of the Avesta. These esoteric
interpreters of the sacred <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> asserted that Zoroaster had couched his
teachings in figurative and enigmatic language.8 The Zoroastrian scriptures
were accordingly divided into 'Great Zend' and 'Little Zend,'9 the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> being

The author, then, cites some instances and explains the difference between
the exoteric and the esoteric interpretations of the Avestan texts. For
instance; when it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the archangel Bahman held a conference with
Zoroaster and asked him to close his eyes, the vulgar, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the

manifested himself before Zoroaster, and his asking the prophet to close his
eyes <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> only that the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> asked him to eradicate all bodily attachment
and suppress carnal desires of the flesh in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to enable him to get a vision
of the archangel.10 When the Zoroastrian texts seem to sanction animal
slaughter, it is to be understood as an injunction to kill the animal
propensities inherent in man.11 The author states further that the passages
which speak of the hermits as partaking of animal food in reasonable bounds
are not to be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> literally. These simply refer to the gradual control and
ultimate killing of the animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">nature</span> in man.12 The legend that Ahriman
appeared at a season festival in the guise of a glutton and devoured
everything to the utter confusion of the assembly, until he was routed by
preparing a dish from the flesh of a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> red cow, mixed with vinegar,
garlic, and rue, at the instance of some miraculous advice, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> by
the masses as literally true. But any <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> versed in esoteric wisdom, and
acquained with the doctrines inculcated by the Dabistan, knows that the
killing of the red cow stands for the suppression of the sensual appetite,
vinegar for the virtue of abstinence, garlic for reflection, and rue for silent
reflection. All these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> kill Ahrimanian propensities in man.13 The
ignorant invest Ahriman with a personality; but, really [467] speaking, he has
no independent existence, for he is not an entity and is simply the negation
of existence.14 The aggregate of bodily passions and sensual appetites is
symbolically termed Ahriman, named from the originator of evil,15 and
Ahriman's predominance in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">world</span> is to exist only for a limited <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> while

ascendency and until they are ultimately curbed and eradicated.16 Again, the
sacred books speak of Ahriman as the creator of serpents and scorpions. But

these noxious creatures, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to this treatise, are <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but allegorical
expressions for the vices and passions that haunt the <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t7 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">human</span> mind.17 All such
persons as stick to the exoteric interpretation of the scriptures believe that
Zohak actually carried <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> serpents on his shoulders, but the adept
understand the statement as applying to the venomous tyranny and
sensuality of the wicked usurper.18 The legend of the flight of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">King</span> Kaus to
the heavens, his fall, and the subsequent restoration of this lost monarch to
his kingdom by Rustam, has likewise an esoteric interpretation. The four
eagles that carried the misguided <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> high up in the air, along with his
throne, signify the four elements. The throne, explains the author, stands for
the predominant bodily passions, the ascent <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> that a devotee can rise to

denotes the revolt of the passions owing to some neglect in the observance
of the ascetic practices, :while Rustam's achievement, in finally bringing
Kaus back from the forest, indicates the flash of proper <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">knowledge</span> that
reclaims the erring aspirant from fatal mishap.19 <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the esoteric writings
veil the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> from the gaze of the vulgar. The real and deep <span class="t6 t13 t14 t25 t27 hoverable">meaning</span> is

RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSIES
Theological disputations. We find from the extent Persian literature that the
writers of this period occupied themselves in minute quibbling and barren
discussions of the ritualistic ceremonies and purificatory rites. There is no
trace of original thinking on vital problems. Their energy was wholly
expended on endless wranglings about dogmas and theological disquisitions.
Questions were raised whether it was essential to cover the face of a corpse
with the penom, or mouth-covering white veil; whether the legs of a corpse
should be folded or left lengthwise, before it was removed to its final resting
place.1 The community was actually divided into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> parties over the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span>

relatives of the dead had under these circumstances to carry dead bodies to
Navsari for their final disposal. This resulted in the erection of separate
towers for the contending parties.
1. Patell, Parsi Prakash, 1, 23, Bombay, 1888. Intercalation controversy
provides a powerful incentive to the study of the ancient Zoroastrian
scriptures. In 1720 were planted seeds of a controversy' which gave,
however, a real and abiding impetus to religious studies. A learned Mobad
named Jamasp, who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to India from Persia, in 1721, <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that the Indian

their year, and he strongly advocated a reform in the matter. The question at

problem that led to a display of strong passion and to the exchange of bitter

zealously turned to the study of the original scriptures, as a source to decide
the matter, and the question was threshed out in detail, accompanied by the
publication of innumerable tracts [471]and pamphlets. While the learned in
the community were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> engaged in ransacking their ancient records, the

The Shahinshahis, or the Imperials, represented the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span>

order, and the dissenters styled themselves the Kadimis, or the Ancients. The
former annoyed the latter by their mocking derision. Social intercourse
between the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> became most strained, the community was split into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>

community into <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sects endures to the present day, but despite the

have obliterated the bitter feelings. Modern researches have proved that
both the parties were wrong in their calculations. The accidentals of the
controversy have changed during the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of hard-fought battles, but
the main question has still remained as unsettled as before. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Among</span> the chief
causes that have contributed to the indefinite postponement of the reform
are the indifference and apathy of the community. The question is looked at

in replying to their inquiring brothers in India advised them in the beginning

thereby be done to the religion and to the community. It was certainly an act
of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> merit, they proceeded, to purchase alien <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> and <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> them up
as Zoroastrians. It was unfair and highly objectionable, they added, nay it
was an inexpiable sin, to refuse these unfortunate <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> all the privileges of

therefore, the pious duty of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> Zoroastrian to help this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> <span class="t1 t3 t9 t15 t20 t21 t26 t29 hoverable">cause</span> by

reply to a question about the conversion of such low-class people, the
Iranian informant wrote that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who dug graves or followed the

element was a reason why proselytizing fell into disfavour. We notice in
that discussion that the <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> sections of the community were divided
more on the social side of the question of proselytizing than on its religious
side. The protest was chiefly based against the admixture of racial blood that
the low class of the aliens introduced into the community. The Zoroastrians
of Persia, who were trampled under the iron [476]foot of their Moslem
conquerors and had lived in servile state, saw no objection whatsoever in
receiving converts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> from the lowest strata of the non-Zoroastrian
peoples. But the case was <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> with the Indian Parsis, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> whom the
improved social and economic conditions had aroused a keen sense of racial
pride and consciousness of their past greatness. A very considerable portion
of the community, it seems, looked with disapproval <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the introduction
of the undesirable element of alien races into their small numbers. This
strong feeling was aggravated the more through the fact that such converts
who sought admission <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> always from the lowest classes. Members of the
upper classes of the non-Zoroastrian communities were not heard knocking
at the door of the Mazdayasnian fire-temples seeking admission. The

community was not disposed to any kind of active religious propaganda. The
cases of conversion were consequently confined either to the slaves <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
up in Parsi families or to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t24 t26 t29 hoverable">children</span> born to Parsi fathers of their nonZoroastrian mistresses.

of foreign element, and fell into disrepute. A beginning of opposition to the
idea of religious propaganda was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> when the entire question of

had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> been felt of producing theological literature in the language of the
people, and several portions of the Persian Rivayats had already been done

on the Pahlavi, Sanskrit, and Persian renderings. This was the last native

Orthodoxy is obstinacy to forget anything <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> and learn anything new.
Orthodoxy has always and everywhere professed that the doctrines, dogmas,

to be disturbed in the thoughts and views he has inherited with his birth. He
seeks refuge in tradition and is content to live secure in the dead past. All

opposition to them. It aims at making <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> religious in its own way. It
moves about with prying eyes and spies on its neighbour's conscience and
struggles to read his thoughts. Whenever it is powerful enough to inflict its

and drives the dissenters to secrete their thoughts in the lowest depths of

all reaction is apt to be, and it ended in indifferentism. The [484]popular
creed as propounded by the traditionalist exponents and orthodox formalists
failed to carry conviction to their intellect. They wanted to verify their
doubts and refused to believe that which, as they said, was not in accord
with reason. The glowing accounts of the reward and retribution of the

educated classes. The imaginings of Viraf failed to exert any restraining

the scenes of the hereafter, depicting the pleasures of the souls of the blessed
in paradise and the agonies of the wicked in hell, which satisfied the <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span>
cravings of their elders for ages, failed longer so to do in the case of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span>
generation. The waters of Ardvisur had inundated the regions of hell and
quenched the blazing fire, the horrors of hell had vanished into thin air, and
the apocalyptic account of Viraf no longer presented to the minds of the
enlightened youth what they had to the strictly orthodox. A treatment of the
unfortunate souls, such as was portrayed traditionally, seemed to them
monstrous, and subverting man's idea of the goodness of Ohrmazd. They
<span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> them to be crude and archaic. The germs of <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> were

with a changed attitude. They gradually became estranged from all beliefs
that had been instilled into them from childhood. They aimed at reconciling
religion and contemporary knowledge, and bringing religious beliefs and
practices into closer relation with the intellectual ways and thought. Parsi
orthodoxy resented it.
An illiterate priesthood failed to satisfy the intellectual wants of the
enlightened youth. The Parsi priesthood had <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> before degenerated into
ignorance. The situation was not keenly felt so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the laity was equally
illiterate. But now when the latter sought enlightenment, the clergy had kept
less and less abreast of the times. During the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> period of twelve centuries,
very few priests rose above mediocrity. The priest hitherto had acted as an

intercessor between the layman and Ohrmazd, and through elaborate ritual
had undertaken to gain for him <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> help, being duly paid to recite
penitential prayers for the expiation of the sins of the living, and to <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span>
for the purchase of paradise for the dead. The youth of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school
argued that there was no more need of the Mobad's mediation between him
[485]and his Heavenly Father. He demanded that the priest should act as a
moral preceptor, a <span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> ministrant to his soul. This, in those times, the
priest <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not do.

himself to the demand of the younger generation. The youth now grew up

The apathy, callousness, and disregard towards religion on the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the

atmosphere of agnosticism that withered the beliefs in which they were
<span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> up. Agnosticism became the threatening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> of the day.

Since the year 1771, when that worthy pioneer of romantic renown in
Iranian studies, Anquetil du Perron, published his volumes containing the

Iranian research. The field is now replete with the lasting monuments of
Western scholarship whether in the department of standard editions of the
sacred texts or the compilation of grammars and dictionaries or again in the
preparation of scientific translations as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as in making exegetical,
philological and archeological researches. The service that these scholars
have rendered to the Parsis is greater than can <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> be expressed. To K. R.
Kama, Parsi pioneer of the Iranian studies on Western lines in India, who had
studied the Avestan texts in Europe under the German savant Spiegel, is due
the credit of introducing <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> Parsi scholars the science of comparative
philology and the scientific method of interpreting their sacred books. The

various times. Scholars such as these undertook to determine the
approximate dates of the component parts of the Avesta. The Gathas were
shown to be the oldest in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> of composition and the authorship of a
considerable portion, if not all, of these [488]hymns was ascribed to
Zoroaster himself.. The prophet's work, it was said, was continued by his

be acknowledged to have <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> fainter in succeeding generations. The
religion of the Younger Avesta had departed in <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> respects from the
religion of the Gathas, and the subsequent compositions showed signs of
degeneration both in substance and style. The simple and abstract <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span> of
the Gathas was blurred if not lost, and the development of the later texts
tended to <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> more complex and concrete. We breathe a <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span>
atmosphere, they declared, when we <span class="t5 hoverable">pass</span> from the Gathic to the Later
Avestan field. Nature-worship, which Zoroaster strove to supplant by a
higher type of ethical religion, was shown to have been reinstated in these
later texts. The masses <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be weaned from the beliefs that loomed
large in their eyes, and thus, the scholars maintained, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> practices
abolished by Zoroaster were later resuscitated by the clergy. Startling indeed
were these <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> ideas that philological re searches <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to the Parsis, who
had been accustomed to at tribute indiscriminately all Avestan compositions
to Zoroaster himself and who <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> approached their own sacred books with
a historical perspective.
Back to the Gathas was the war-cry of the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school. This critical
estimate of their scripture by the Iranian scholars of the West greatly
influenced the young Parsi scholars in India. They now hailed the Gathas as
providing a self-sufficient religious system in themselves. They claimed to
have discovered the only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> mirror in which the genuine teachings of
Zoroaster were, reflected. The Later Avestan texts were declared to render

nugatory the pristine purity. An exuberant outgrowth of dogmatic theology
and ceremonial observances, they asserted, had supplanted the buoyant
simplicity of the Gathic teachings, and simply' represented a decline from
the pure teachings of Zoroaster. The names of the Amshaspands in the
Gathas were considered to be merely descriptive of the attributes of
Ohrmazd. These attributes, they insisted, had crystallized into concrete
beings, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> converting the monotheistic religion of Zoroaster into a
veritable system of polytheism. Tradition, they argued, attributed to
Zoroaster doctrines that he <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> preached. They advocated a return to the
[489]original purity of the faith by stripping off the accretions that had
gathered round the pure canon of the prophet, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> removing the haze of
ignorance and bigotry that had overclouded the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of their excellent
religion. All this was highly sacrilegious to orthodox ears. Such statements
roused the strong resentment of the community and elicited vehement
protests from priests and laymen alike. The <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school was assailed on all
sides. More sober opinion intervened to modify the sweeping assertions, and
declared that while the Gathas, of course, should be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> as the norm, there
should <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> be admitted into the Zoroastrian canon such parts of the later
scriptures as were in accord with the Gathic spirit; but whatever <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not be
traced to the Gathas was adventitious, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> not deserving of
acceptance. The problem at once arose as to who was going to distinguish
the authoritative from the un-authoritative and a <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> controversy opened
amid still more bitter feelings.
A <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> theory to defend the Gathas from the accusation of dualism. The
salient feature of dualism in the Iranian faith has <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> been the chief point
assailed by the non-Zoroastrians, both in ancient and modern times,
whenever they have entered into religious disputations with the followers of
the prophet. They have laid the doctrine of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">gods</span> to the charge of
Zoroastrianism. The accidentals of the controversy have varied materially in
their character at <span class="t1 t2 t18 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">different</span> periods, but the main point of contention has <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>
remained the same. We have already seen how vehemently the learned
prelates of the Pahlavi period strove to vindicate this characteristic feature of
the Zoroastrian teachings. <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">Far</span> from considering it a weak point, they hailed
it the only possible solution of the problem of evil. Not so their modern
descendants. The repeated attack of the Christian missionaries, and the

strong influence of the Western literature, which hailed monotheism as the
<span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> category of theology, <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> about an unprecedented change in
this belief; and so powerful has this influence been, that we hardly <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> find
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> at this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> any learned Parsi priest or layman marshalling arguments in

was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> it to the notice of the Parsis that [490]the leading idea
of the Gathas was monotheism. Ahura Mazda, he declared, is the supreme
godhead, who has produced the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> rival principles Spenta Mainyu and
Angra Mainyu as his twin spirits. Separated as they seem, they are united in
action. They are indispensable to each other in the formation and conduct of
the universe. They are the creative and the destroying, constructive and
destructive powers of God, and are as inseparable from each other as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and

Gathas does Angra Mainyu, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Evil</span> Spirit, stand in direct opposition to
Ahura Mazda. This fundamental distinction, he said, is lost sight of in the
late period, and we find in the Vendidad that the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Good</span> <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">Spirit</span> Spenta Mainyu

stands in direct antagonism to God. The Parsi scholars who were <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> in
search for some <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> arguments to remove the so-called weak point of their
faith eagerly embraced this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> explanation, which, they thought, saved the
Gathas at least from the stain of dualism. If the Vendidad and other later
<span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> introduced it in the Zoroastrian theology, it was a decided fall, they
claimed, from the original pure monotheism. The prophet himself <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span>
taught dualism, they argued, and it is unfair to ascribe that doctrine to him,
for which the enlightened youth had to blush before modern criticism!

and exposed them to the ridicule of the Parsi youth newly tinged with
Western ideas. The community was alarmed at this aggression, the more so

Salient features of Zoroastrianism assailed by the missionaries. The
religion of Zoroaster, the controversialists alleged, abounded in absurdities
and incongruities. It was based on the idolatry of nature. The Parsi scholars
repudiated the accusation with indignation, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that in their reverence

interpretation was <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> as an unequivocal testimony of the Zoroastrian

their opponents by resorting to allegorical explanations. This attempt at
giving allegorical interpretations of the scriptures was carried still further.

of the Vendidad, and modern scholarship had accepted that view; but in

of the <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">chapter</span> by asserting that the act of Ohrmazd in creating Iran Vej, the

for religious faith, and Ahriman's counter <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> of winter was emblematic
of infidelity. Similarly, the various places <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to have been created by

spoken of in the Vendidad as taking possession of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who has touched

the demon is successively driven out from the top of the head of the defiled
<span class="t9 hoverable">person</span> to the tips of his toes, as the ablution ceremony is being performed.
This rite was criticized as being revolting to common sense.7 Instead of

defending it on hygienic principles, the learned controversialists again
expatiated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the mystic significance of the text, and alleged that the
<span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> ceremony referred to the internal purification of man, and that Nasu
represented his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">evil</span> nature, while the successive expulsion of the fiend from

improvement of a man's character.8 Zoroastrianism teaches that the <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> of
burying corpses is inexpiable.9 The pulling down of the dakhmas, wherein lie
interred the dead bodies of such men, is a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of the expiation of one's
sins in thought, word, and deed; and is equivalent to the recital of a Patit.10
Responding to a criticism on this passage, recourse was again <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> to
declare it as couched in mysterious language. It was curiously explained to
mean that the dakhma referred to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of man, the corpse stood for his

origin, the tongue in which Ohrmazd addressed his heavenly court, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>
that in which Ahriman harangued his ribald crew, had preserved it as the

was meaningless to mumble an unintelligible gibberish which <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> the
priest himself nor the layman understood. Ejaculations and genuflexions were
of no avail, when they recited their prayers in a dead language. No amount
of such formulas <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> affect the character of the devotees and ennoble their
thoughts. A prayer that had no subjective value was no prayer. It failed to
awaken any ethical fervour, for a truly devout prayer should spur the <span class="t0 t1 t3 t5 t7 t8 t13 t16 t18 t20 t21 t25 t27 t29 hoverable">spirit</span>
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> to a higher life. This was not possible so <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as the priest
perfunctorily droned prayers, not a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of which was understood. The
orthodox vehemently retorted that the Avestan language Was divine, and as
such it possessed inherent magical efficacy. Miraculously composed as these
Avestan prayers were, they had indescribable objective value, it was claimed,
quite independent of the motive of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who recited them. The mere
utterance of the sacred texts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> knowing in the least what they meant,
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> produce marvellous effect. The ultra-orthodox viewed the situation
with pious dread and entertained serious apprehension that, if once the
community permitted the use of Gujarati or English compositions for daily
prayers, <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> short of a revolutionary change <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> come, and with the
lapse of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the Avestan texts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be supplanted by prayer-books
composed in the modern vernaculars. The reformers pointed out that there
already existed some monajat prayers composed in Persian by some of the
learned Dasturs <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span> in their own lifetime, which the orthodox were using

controversy raged around this question, with the result that the orthodox
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on praying in their own way, and the reformers, <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> having faith in
the recital of their prayers in an unintelligible language nor having a proper

substitute to satisfy their demand, <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> prayers of any kind. And the
situation remains, in large measure, unchanged up to this very day.
The Avesta <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> metamorphosed into an ungrammatical jargon. The
reformers further <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that the Avestan texts were recited with the most
incorrect pronunciations. In vindication of their statement they quoted
passages from the original texts and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> by their side the corrupt formulas in
vogue in the community. An example of this kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> not be out of <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span>
here, and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> insert the <span class="t2 t7 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t17 t20 t24 t29 hoverable">text</span> of Ahunavar, the most important

which obtains <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> a considerable portion of the community up to this
hour. The original formula is as follows :
yathâ ahu vairyo athâ ratush ashât chit hachâ
vangheush dazdâ manangho shyaothananâm angheush Mazdâi
khshathremchâ ahurâi â yim dregubyo dadat vâstârem.
The corrupt <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the same:
athâu veryo thâre tose sâde chide châvanghoise dezdâ manengho sotthenanâm anghyos
Mazdâe khosetharamchâe orâe âiyem daregobyo daredar vâstârem.
This, however, did not trouble the orthodox, for they complacently
remarked that as <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as they had implicit faith in what they recited, and
recited it whole-heartedly, it mattered very little whether they <span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> correct
pronunciation or not. Ohrmazd looked to their hearts, and not to their sense
of grammar and orthography. So <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> as their motives were good, their
prayers were acceptable to the Heavenly Father. The redeeming feature of
this entire controversy has been a growing tendency in the community to
avail itself of the help of the philologist, who has <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> nearer home to
them the correct and carefully edited version of their sacred scriptures, and
they have consequently begun to recite their daily prayers from books that
have based their texts on the standard and authorized version of the liturgy.
[498] Too <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> ritualism, protested the reformer. The mechanical
handling of the ritual, which was as <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> unintelligible in its real purport to
the priest who performed it as it was to the layman who ordered it, failed to
satisfy the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school. The orthodox maintained that although the priestly

authorities themselves had lost the key of the mysteries of the ceremonies
and were unable to understand their meaning, nevertheless untold <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> accrued to those who devoutly ordered such ceremonies for their own merit.
They entertained a pious hope that the lost key <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> some <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> be
recovered, and the hidden secrets <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">light</span> of the day. The
reformers urged that a vast structure of formalism and ritual had replaced the
edifice of the simple faith, and religion had simply turned into ritualism.
They dwelt especially on the subjective value of the ritual, and argued that
<span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> elaborate and expensive the ceremony <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> be, it was of no value
if it failed to symbolize a moral idea for the faithful who ordered it.
Ceremonial observances, they complained, were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> greater importance
than moral observance. Righteousness was identified with rituals. They were
only a clothing of religion, but the ethical substance of religion was of
greater importance than the clothing itself. Religion, they urged, does not
consist in laying up merit by ceremonials. The orthodox retorted that the
ritual as such had an intrinsic value and inherent merit, and the more such
rites were performed, the greater was the merit assured to the faithful. The
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> school <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that these ceremonials <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">may</span> perhaps serve as a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t6 t7 t9 t13 t14 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">means</span> of
conveying ethical ideas to a backward people, but the Parsis were not a
backward people. Hence they did not need them. Righteousness did not
depend <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> such ceremonial observances, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the purity of man's
inner life. Besides, the ceremonials became an economic drain on the slender
resources of the credulous poor, who incurred heavy debts for their
performance, which was displeasing in the sight of Ohrmazd. The orthodox
declared these statements an Ahrimanian onslaught <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the Mazdayasnian
rites.
The progressives denounced the intercessory prayers for the dead. The
philological researches had for the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> to the notice of the
Parsis the fact of the sharp distinction between man's <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and his Farohar.
From what has been stated in the earlier pages, it can be clearly seen how
this essential [499]difference was lost sight of, as early as during the later
Pahlavi period. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">soul</span> and the Farohar were <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> to be <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same
by the Zoroastrians before the philologist pointed out the error. Priest and
layman, the learned and the illiterate alike, believed implicitly that the souls
of the dead profited by the ceremonials performed in their honour by their

relatives in this world. The Avestan and Pahlavi passages, which speak of the
coming of the Farohars to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> at the period of the Fravar-digan festival,
seeking invocation and sacrifice, were understood by the entire Community
as indubitably referring to the coming of the souls of the dead.1 1. K. M.

<span class="t7 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">spiritual</span> welfare of the departed. Propitiatory offerings were made, and
penitential prayers were recited to secure a better lot for the souls of the
dead, and the performance of these periodical rites was most zealously
observed. Rich viands were consecrated in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the deceased.

were offered them to assuage the hunger and thirst on their return journey,
while money in copper and silver was dedicated to them to meet their
travelling expenses. The recital of the Patit, or expiatory prayer, forms an important <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> of the ceremonies performed in honour of the dead. The

the Farohar of the dead man, and not for his soul. In fact, it was claimed,

replied that they were simply looking to antiquity for models for their

the religious beliefs of a section of the [503]community through their active
propaganda. Hitherto ritual observances, theological dogmas, and
ecclesiastical usages had occupied a most conspicuous <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> in the religious

Custodians of the only key to Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster and his disciples,
the theosophical interpreters said, wrote in a mystic language which
conveyed a double meaning. The exoteric, or surface meaning, was intended
for the vulgar, and the esoteric, or inner meaning, was designed only for the
initiates. The adepts of various periods were the ones who possessed the
mysterious key to the chamber of hidden truths. The last of such Parsi adept
was Azar Kaivan, who died at Patna in 1614. With his <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> this key was

Zoroastrian theosophists applied this key to Zoroastrianism to unravel the
mysteries of its exoteric teachings. They aimed at an adjustment of the
fundamental Zoroastrian concept <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the standard philosophy of

Hinduism and Buddhism.
The theosophists summarily rejected the method of the philologist
adopted in interpreting the sacred texts. In their zeal for discovering <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

this explanation as absurd, and discerned in the chapters an allegorical
description of conscience and its workings. Space here precludes the citation
of other examples of this kind. When the linguists challenged such
interpretation of the ancient texts, they were informed that their inability to

reconcile themselves to the <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> esoteric explanations was due to the fact of

The theosophists in this controversy denounced the philologists, and the
philologists denounced the theosophists.

such a revival the sole panacea of communal ills, whether real or imaginary,
their readiness to allege religious sanction for the time-hallowed customs,
matched with their zeal for ritual, and their eagerness to vindicate the sacred
ceremonies by giving strained allegorical interpretations to explain them,
won for them the applause of the orthodox ? party, who cast in their lot with
them. Inasmuch as the Parsi, theosophists declared that they were working to
<span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> out the youth of the community from the, trough of materialism, and
[505]endeavoring to defend Zoroastrianism against innovations of the
reformers, they were regarded as the pillars of faith and the guardians of the
edifice of ceremonialism.
Avestan prayers, <span class="t27 t28 hoverable">however</span> unintelligible, were declared the most
efficacious owing to their occult significance. We have already seen the

in the controversy. The syllables composed in the Avestan texts, they
averred, were so mysteriously adjusted to each other in the prayers, that they
produced vibrations on the ethereal plane, when pronounced. The potency

Zoroastrian theology. Such an interpretation, however, led them to credit
the religion of Zoroaster with ideas that in no period of its religious history
were <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> included in its sphere. When these theosophic interpreters of
Zoroastrianism were reminded that the thoughts they claimed to read in the
canonical Zoroastrian <span class="t9 t16 t26 hoverable">works</span> were not there, they argued with a doubtful
historical perspective that if they did not meet them in the plain words, in
the authentic texts, it was because the twenty-one Nasks of the prophet had
not been preserved. If the bulk of the Zoroastrian canon had not been
irrevocably lost, they should undoubtedly have <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> such doctrines to be
indissolubly associated with the cardinal texts of the Zoroastrian faith. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Every</span>

Zrvan Akarana as an impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> in the theosophic light. The
theosophists attempted a readjustment of the Zoroastrian doctrine of a
personal God, or rather in accordance with their theory of an impersonal
God. Personality, they alleged implied limitation and was a characteristic of
the finite. A personal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> meant that the godhead was a limited God, and
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> an incomplete God. In Zrvan Akarana, or Boundless Time, the

Parsi theosophists saw this impersonal neuter being of whom <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
be predicated. This supposititious being was the rootless root from which
issued Ohrmazd. Ahriman was but Ohrmazd's manifested shadow. Zrvan
Akarana, the primeval impersonal principle, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to their interpretation,
was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a central <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> from which all <span class="t14 hoverable">creation</span> had emanated. The individual
was only a vital spark, and his final resting-place was in it. Passionately
loving the light, the moth finally immolated itself in the flame; in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>
manner the individual had to throw off the illusory shackles of personality
and be merged in the Universal, the One. This doctrine is certainly not
Zoroastrian, because through the <span class="t3 t5 t7 t9 t20 t28 t29 hoverable">whole</span> history of the religion individuality
is not an illusion. It is <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> a stern fact. Personality is not an imperfection, but
it is the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> expression of life, that ultimately strives for the divine. Not
the losing of individuality and the loss of the personal self, and not the
weakening of personality, but the gaining and strengthening of it, is the
Zoroastrian ideal. This has been the <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> taught by Zoroastrianism in the
striving [507] for the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> aims comprehensible to mankind from the
remotest antiquity. Zrvan was extolled above Ohrmazd, who was ranked by
them as a mere manifestation of Time. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> was elevated by debasing the
other.

but which evaporated into an unthinkable abstraction and mercilessly left its
hapless votaries <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of solace or hope. Affection, <span class="t7 hoverable">love</span> and
devotion, however, can centre about some personality only. We find in the
authoritative teachings of the Zoroastrian Church that Ohrmazd knows no
peer, and he always sits supreme at the head of the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">divine</span> hierarchy. These
modern votaries of Zrvan were, however, not to be confounded with the
Zarvanite sect of old, which looked to Zrvan Akarana as a personality as
<span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> defined as Ohrmazd. We have already seen that, in postulating
impersonated <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> as the originator of Ohrmazd and Ahriman, the sect
aimed at supplanting Zoroastrian dualism by monotheism, in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save
their religion from the so-called stigma of dualism. Not so the theosophists,
who grafted this <span class="t0 t1 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">new</span> feature on the pure teachings of Zoroaster. They did
not personify Time, but reckoned this abstract principle of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Time</span> as higher
than Ohrmazd himself, because, in common with all mystic schools, they
held the idea of an impersonal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">God</span> as the <span class="t6 t9 t22 t29 hoverable">highest</span> category of philosophical

CONCLUSION
And now we have reached the completion of our study down to the present
day. We have traced the gradual development of the religion of Zarathushtra
during the various periods of its history. Nearly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> thousand <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t20 t22 t23 t28 hoverable">years</span> have

Zarathushtra's immortal triad of 'good thoughts, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> words, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span>

thoughts, illumined the minds, and warmed the hearts of the countless
numbers of his followers. Throughout its history Zoroastrianism has seen its
bright and dark days, accompanied by the rise and fall of the political <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

of its adherents. During these ages, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> and mighty kings, in whom was

periods of the nation's history and will <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span> continue to rule so in the ages to
come. Zarathushtra, the chosen of Ahura Mazda, does not belong to any
single period and particular people, but to all ages and to all peoples. He is
unchanging. His religion it was that inspired the Iranian nation with the
loftiest of ideals when Iran was at the zenith of her power. His <span class="t29 hoverable">ever</span>

saved its remnants from falling into the slough of pessimism and gloom,
thirteen centuries ago, when the Zoroastrian community stood appalled by
the national catastrophe that sounded the death-knell of their empire. With
the downfall of the empire the hope of regaining <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> had disappeared

them in the fatherland was gone. Zarathushtra remained their only hope, and
with his religion as the only cherished heritage, the Parsi exiles sought an
asylum in Iran. Thirteen centuries have dragged their weary course since

The pages of their national history are still thrilling with the noble deeds of
the ancient Iranians, and their dutiful descendants have faithfully reflected
their past national glory in the mirror of their small community. Zoroastrian

Zarathushtra's religion is the best sedative for him to-day. So will it be in all

Zarathushtra has been the hope of the Parsis in the past. So is he now, and
so will he be forever. 1. Vd. 19. 5.
