Why <span class="t27 hoverable">proving</span> <span class="t23 t27 hoverable">source</span> of a <span class="t27 hoverable">cyberattack</span> is so <span class="t27 hoverable">damn</span> <span class="t5 t11 t16 hoverable">difficult</span>

The <span class="t23 hoverable">answer</span> is both <span class="t23 hoverable">complicated</span> and <span class="t27 hoverable">inherently</span> tied up in <span class="t6 t8 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t27 hoverable">political</span> considerations.  The <span class="t0 t1 t6 t8 t9 t10 t12 t14 t24 t27 hoverable">administration</span> is balancing <span class="t6 t8 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t27 hoverable">political</span> <span class="t23 t27 t28 hoverable">considerations</span> and the <span class="t23 hoverable">inherent</span> <span class="t24 hoverable">secrecy</span> of electronic espionage with the need to justify its <span class="t0 t8 t9 t10 t14 hoverable">actions</span> to the public.

It’s true that it’s easy for an <span class="t23 hoverable">attacker</span> to hide who he is in cyberspace. We are <span class="t27 hoverable">unable</span> to <span class="t4 hoverable">identify</span> particular pieces of hardware and software around the <span class="t21 t23 t27 hoverable">world</span> positively.
