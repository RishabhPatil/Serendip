PART I: <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 1
THIS IS THE ACCOUNT OF HOW ALL WAS in suspense, all calm, in silence; all
motionless, still, and the expanse of the sky was empty.
This is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> account, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> narrative. There was <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> man, nor animal, birds, fishes,

The surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> had not appeared.

There was only immobility and silence in the darkness, in the night. Only the creator, the
Maker, Tepeu, Gucumatz, the Forefathers, were in the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> surrounded with light. They were

Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> the word.

Tepeu and Gucumatz talked together. They talked then, discussing and deliberating; they

Then while they meditated, it became clear to them that when dawn <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> break, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span>

A flood was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> about by the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">Heart</span> of Heaven; a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> flood was formed which fell on
the heads of the wooden creatures.
Of tzité the flesh of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was made, but when woman was fashioned by the Creator and the

wanted to use in making them.
But those that they had made, that they had created, did not think, did not speak with their
Creator, their Maker. And for this reason they were killed, they were deluged. A heavy resin
fell from the sky. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xecotcovach <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> and gouged out their eyes; Camalotz

Tucumbalam came,
too, and broke and mangled their bones and their nerves, and ground and crumbled their
bones.
This was to punish them because they had not <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> of their mother, nor their father, the

And all began to speak: their earthen jars, their griddles, their plates, their pots, their grinding
stones, all rose up and struck their faces.
"You have done us <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> harm; you ate us, and now we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> kill you," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> their dogs and

And the grinding stones said: "We were tormented by you; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> day, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">every</span> day, at night, at

And then their dogs spoke and said: "Why did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> us <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to eat? You scarcely

"Thus it was that you treated us. You did not speak to us. Perhaps we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not kill you now;

and then, they destroyed their faces.

And at the same time, their griddles and pots spoke: "Pain and suffering you have caused us.
Our mouths and our faces were blackened with soot; we were always <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and you

heaped together, hurled themselves straight from the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> against their heads causing them
pain.
The desperate ones [the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of wood] ran as quickly as they could; they wanted to climb to
the tops of the houses.
And the houses fell down and threw them to the ground; they wanted to climb to the treetops,
and the trees cast them <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> away; they wanted to enter the caverns, and the caverns repelled
them.
So was the ruin of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> who had been created and formed, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> to be destroyed

And it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> that their descendants are the monkeys which now live in the forests; these are

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">therefore</span> the monkey looks <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> man, and is an example of a generation of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> which

IT WAS CLOUDY AND TWILIGHT THEN ON the face of the earth. There was no <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> yet.
Nevertheless, there was a being <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Vucub-Caquix, who was very proud of himself.
The sky and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> existed, but the faces of the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> and the moon were covered.
And he [Vucub-Caquix] said: "Truly, they are clear examples of those <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> who were

I am the sun, the light, the

Because of me <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> walk and conquer. For
my eyes are of silver, bright, resplendent as precious stones, as emeralds; my teeth shine <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span>

"So, then, I am the sun, I am the moon, for all mankind. So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> it be, because I can <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> very

So Vucub-Caquix spoke. But he was not really the sun; he was only vainglorious of his
feathers and his riches. And he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> only as <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> as the horizon, and he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> over

Now we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell how Vucub-Caquix was overthrown and died, and how <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> by

when it dawned and which were created in a single night by Zipacná.
In this way, then, Cabracán moved the mountains and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the large and small mountains

Vucub-Caquix had a large nantze tree and he ate the fruit of it. Each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the tree
and climbed to the top. Hunahpú and Xbalanqué had seen that this fruit was his food. And
they lay in ambush at the foot of the tree, hidden <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the leaves.

straight to his meal of nantzes.
Instantly he was injured by a discharge from Hun-Hunahpú's blowgun which struck him
squarely in the jaw, and screaming, he fell straight to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> from the treetop.
Hun-Hunahpú ran quickly to overpower him, but Vucub-Caquix seized his arm and
wrenching it from him, bent it back to the shoulder. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Vucub-Caquix tore out HunHunahpú's arm.

"What has happened to you, my lord?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Chimalmat, his wife.

The <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> walked along followed by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys, who stayed behind them. In
this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they arrived at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> who was screaming because his tooth pained
him.
When Vucub-Caquix saw the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> and the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman and those who accompanied them,
he asked, "Where do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from, grandparents?"

"We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> looking for something to eat, honorable sir," they answered.
"And what do you eat? Are those not your <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> who are with you?"
"Oh, no, sir! They are our grandsons; but we are sorry for them and what is <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to us, we
share with them, sir," answered the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman and the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> man.
Meanwhile, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> was suffering terrible pain from his tooth, and it was only with <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span>

"I earnestly beseech you to have pity on me. What can you do? What do you <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> how to

And the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> ones answered, "Oh, sir! we only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> the worm from the teeth, cure the eyes, and
<span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> bones."
"Very well. Cure my teeth, which are really making me suffer <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> and night, and because of
them and of my eyes I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> be calm and <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> sleep. All of this is because <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> demons
shot me with a pellet [from their blowgun] and for that reason I <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> eat. Have pity on me,
then, tighten my teeth with your hands."
"Very well, sir. It is a worm which makes you suffer. It will <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> when these teeth are pulled
and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> in their place."
"It is not <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> that you pull my teeth, because it is only with them that I am a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> and all my
ornaments are my teeth and my eyes."
"'We will <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> of ground bone in their place." But the ground bone was <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but
grains of white corn.
"Very well, pull them out, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> and relieve me," he replied.
Then they pulled Vucub-Caquix's teeth; but in their <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> they <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> only grains of white corn,
and these grains of corn shone in his mouth. Instantly his features sagged and he no longer
looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a lord. They removed the rest of his teeth which shone <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> pearls in his mouth.
And finally they cured Vucub-Caquix's eyes, piercing the pupils of his eyes, and they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> all
his riches.
But he felt <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> any more. He only watched, because at the advice of Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué, they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> from him all of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> of which he had been so proud.
Then Vucub-Caquix died. Hun-Hunahpú recovered his arm. Chimalmat, the wife of VucubCaquix, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> perished.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Vucub-Caquix lost his riches. The healer <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> all the emeralds and precious stones
which had been his pride here on earth.
The <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman and the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> who did this were miraculous beings; and having recovered
the arm of Hun-Hunahpú, they <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it in place, and it was all <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> again.

It was only to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> about the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">death</span> of Vucub-Caquix that they did this, because it seemed
wicked to them that he should <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> so arrogant.
And then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> youths <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on, having in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> carried out the <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">Heart</span> of

I. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 7
Here now are the deeds of Zipacná the elder <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">son</span> of Vucub-Caquix.
"I am the creator of the mountains," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Zipacná.
Zipacná was bathing at the edge of a river when four hundred youths passed dragging a log to
support their house. The four hundred were walking, after having cut down a large tree to
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> the ridge-pole of their house.
Then Zipacná <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up, and going toward the four hundred youths, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "What are
you doing, boys?"
"It is only this log," they answered, "which we <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> lift and carry on our shoulders."
"I will carry it. Where does it have to go? What do you want it for?"
"For a ridge-pole for our house."
"All right," he answered, and lifting it up, he <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it on his shoulders and carried it to the
entrance of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> of the four hundred boys.
"Now stay with us, boy," they said. "Have you a mother or father;"
"I have neither," he answered.
"Then we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> hire you tomorrow to prepare <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> log to support our house."
"Good," he answered.
The four hundred boys talked <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> then. and said:
"How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we kill this boy? Because it is not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> what he has done lifting the log alone. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span>

'Go down and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> out the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span>
and carry it from the pit,' we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell him. and when he stoops down, to go down into the pit,
we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the large log fall on him and he will die there in the pit."
So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the four hundred boys, and then they dug a large, very deep pit. Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Zipacná.
"We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> you very much. Go, go and dig dirt, for we <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">cannot</span> reach [the bottom of the pit],"
they said.

"All right," he answered. He <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once into the pit. And calling to him as he was digging
the dirt, they said: "Have you gone down very deep yet?"
"Yes," he answered beginning to dig the pit. But the pit which he was making was to save him
from danger. He knew that they wanted to kill him; so when he dug the pit, he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span>

"How <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> [have you gone]?" the four hundred boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> down.
"I am still digging; I will call up to you when I have finished the digging," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Zipacná from
the bottom of the pit. But he was not digging his grave; instead he was opening <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> pit in
<span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save himself.
At last Zipacná <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> to them. But when he called, he was already safe in the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> pit.

But from his pit Zipacná listened to everything the boys said. And later, on the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> day,
multitudes of ants came, going and coming and gathering under the log. Some carried
Zipacná's hair in their mouths and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> carried his fingernails.
When the boys saw this, they said, "That devil has now perished. Look how the ants have
gathered, how they have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> by hordes, some bringing his hair and <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> his fingernails.
Look what we have done!" So they spoke to each other.
Nevertheless, Zipacná was very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> alive. He had cut his hair and gnawed off his
fingernails to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> them to the ants.

And so the four hundred boys believed that he was dead, and on the third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they began the
orgy and all of the boys got drunk. And the four hundred being drunk knew <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> any more.
And then Zipacná <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> fall on their heads and killed all of them.

The boys' hearts were full of rancor because the four hundred young <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> had been killed by
Zipacná. And he only hunted fish and crabs at the bank of the river, which were his daily
food. During the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> about looking for food, and at night he carried mountains on his

With a leaf of the ec plant which is <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> in the forest, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué quickly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>

"Where are you going, young man?" they asked him.
"I am not going anywhere," Zipacná answered, "only looking for food, boys."
"And what is your food?"
"Fish and crabs, but there are none here and I have not <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> any; I have not eaten since <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span>

Zipacná.
His meekness convinced the boys. And they asked him: But, can you really catch him?
Because it is only for you that we are returning; we are not going to try to get it again because
it bit us when we were crawling into the cave. After that we were afraid to crawl in, but we
almost caught it. So, then, it is best that you crawl in," they said.
"Very well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Zipacná, and then they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> with him. They arrived at the bottom of the
ravine and there, stretched on his back, was the crab, showing his red shell. And there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> in

Meanwhile, Cabracán was busy shaking the mountains. At the gentlest tap of his feet on the
earth, the large and small mountains opened. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the boys <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> him and asked Cabracán:
"Where are you going, young man?
"Nowhere," he answered," here I am moving the mountains, and I am leveling them to the
ground forever," he answered.
Then Cabracán asked Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, "What did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to do here? I do not

"We have no names," they answered, "we are <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than shooters of blowguns and
hunters with bird-traps on the mountains. We are poor and we have nothing, young man. We
only walk over the large and small mountains, young man, and we have just seen a large

Cabracán.
"Have you really seen the mountain of which you speak? Where is it?

"Over there it is, where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> rises," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
"Very well, show me the road," he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys.
"Oh no!" they answered. "We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> you between us. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go at your left and the

they did not use the clay pellets in the tube of the blowgun; instead they felled the birds only
with the puff of air when they shot them, which surprised Cabracán very much.
Then the boys built a <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the birds on it to roast, but they rubbed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the birds with

Xbalanqué to each other.
Meanwhile the birds were roasting, they were beginning to turn golden brown, and the fat and
juice which dripped from them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> an appetizing odor. Cabracán wanted very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to eat

the smell which the birds gave off.

Then he asked them: "What is that you eat? The smell is really savoury. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Give</span> me a little

Then they gave a bird to Cabracán, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be his ruin; and when he had

"Go, Ahpop Achih!" they were told. "Go and call Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Say</span> to
them, 'Come with us. The lords <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> come.'

with us so that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">make</span> us happy, for really they amaze us. So, then, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> come,"
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the lords. "And have them <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> their playing gear, their rings, their gloves, and have
them <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> their rubber balls, too," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the lords. "Tell them to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> quickly," they told the
messengers.
And these messengers were owls: Chabi-Tucur, Huracán-Tucur, Caquix-Tucur and HolomTucur. These were the names of the messengers of Xibalba.
Chabi-Tucur was swift as an arrow; Huracán-Tucur had only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> leg; Caquix-Tucur had a red
back, and Holom-Tucur had only a head, no legs, but he had wings.
The four messengers had the rank of Ahpop-Achih. Leaving Xibalba, they arrived quickly,
bringing their message to the court where Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú were playing
ball, at the ball-court which was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Nim-Xob-Carchah. The owl messengers <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> directly
to the ball-court and delivered their message exactly as it was <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> to them by Hun-Camé,
Vucub-Camé, Ahalpuh, Ahalganá, Chamiabac, Chamiaholom, Xiquiripat, Cuchumaquic,
Ahalmez, Ahaltocob, Xic, and Patán, as the lords were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> who sent the message by the
owls.
"Did the Lords Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé really <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> that we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> go with you?"
"They certainly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> so, and 'Let them <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> all their playing gear,' the lords said."
"Very well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the youths. "Wait for us, we are only going to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> good-bye to our mother."
And having gone straight home, they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to their mother, for their <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> was dead: "We are
going, our mother, but our going is only for a while. The messengers of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to

'They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> come,' they said, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to the messengers.
"We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> leave our ball here in pledge," they added. They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately to hang it in the
space under the rooftree. "We will return to play," they said.
And going to Hunbatz and Hunchouén they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "Keep on playing the flute and
singing, painting, and carving; warm our <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and warm the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> of your grandmother."
When they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> leave of their mother, Xmucané was moved and burst into tears. "Do not
worry, we are going, but we have not died yet," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú as
they left.
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately and the messengers <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> them on the
road. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they were descending the road to Xibalba, by some very steep stairs. They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span>
down until they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the bank of a river which flowed rapidly between the ravines <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Nuziván cul and Cuziván, and crossed it. Then they crossed the river which flows <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span>

thorny calabash trees. There were very <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> calabash trees, but they passed through them
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hurting themselves.
Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the bank of a river of blood and crossed it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> drinking its waters; they
only <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the river bank and so they were not overcome. They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on until they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to
where four roads joined, and there at the crossroads they were overcome.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">One</span> of the four roads was red, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> black, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> white, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> yellow. And the
black road <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "I am the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> because I am the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> of the Lord." So
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the road.
And from here on they were already overcome. They were <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> over the road to Xibalba and
when they arrived at the council room of the Lords of Xibalba, they had already lost the
match.
Well, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> ones who were seated there were only figures of wood, arranged by the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of
Xibalba. These they greeted first:
"How are you, Hun-Camé?" they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the wooden man. "How are you, Vucub-Camé?" they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the other wooden man. But they did not answer. instantly the Lords of Xibalba burst
into laughter and all the other lords began to laugh loudly, because they already <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> for
granted the downfall and defeat of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. And they continued to
laugh.
Then Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé spoke: "Very well," they said. "You have come.
Tomorrow you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> prepare the mask, your rings, and your gloves," they said.
"Come and sit down on our bench," they said. But the bench which they offered them was of
hot stone, and when they sat down they were burned. They began to squirm around on the
bench, and if they had not stood up they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have burned their seats.
The Lords of Xibalba burst out laughing again; they were dying of laughter; they writhed
from pain in their stomach, in their blood, and in their bones, caused by their laughter, all the
Lords of Xibalba laughed.
"Go now to that house," they said. "There you will get your sticks of fat pine and your cigar
and there you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> sleep."
Immediately they arrived at the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom. There was only darkness <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the house.
Meanwhile the Lords of Xibalba discussed what they should do.
"Let us <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> them tomorrow, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> them die quickly, quickly, so that we can have their

Well, their fat-pine sticks were round and were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> zaquitoc, which is the pine of Xibalba.
Their fat-pine sticks were pointed and filed and were as bright as bone; the pine of Xibalba
was very hard.
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Gloom. There they were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> their
fat-pine sticks, a single lighted stick which Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé sent them, <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span>

with a lighted cigar for each of them which the lords had sent. They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> them to
Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.
They <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> them crouching in the darkness when the porters arrived with the fat-pine sticks

They sacrificed them immediately and buried them in the Pucbal-Chah, as it was called.
Before burying them, they cut off the head of Hun-Hunahpú and buried the older brother
<span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> with the younger brother.
"Take the head and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it in that tree which is Planted on the road," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hun-Camé and
Vucub-Camé. And having <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the head in the tree, instantly the tree, which had <span class="t0 t10 t11 t14 t18 hoverable">never</span> borne
fruit before the head of Hun-Hunahpú was placed <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> its branches, was covered with fruit.
And this calabash tree, it is said, is the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which we now call the head of Hun-Hunahpú.

Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé looked in amazement at the fruit on the tree. The round fruit was
everywhere; but they did not recognize the head of Hun-Hunahpú; it was exactly <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> the

the Lords of Xibalba resolved to keep everybody away.
The head of Hun-Hunahpú did not appear again because it had <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> and the same as

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 3
THIS is the story of a maiden, the daughter of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> named Cuchumaquic.
A maiden, then, daughter of a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> heard this story.

and that of the maiden was Xquic. When she heard the story of the fruit of the tree which her
<span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span> told, she was amazed to hear it.
"Why can I not go to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> this tree which they tell about?" the girl exclaimed. "Surely the fruit
of which I hear tell <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be very good."

tree which was planted in Pucbal-Chah.
"Ah!" she exclaimed. "What fruit is this which this tree bears? Is it not wonderful to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> how

wish? Those round objects which cover the branches of the trees are <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but skulls." So
spoke the head of Hun-Hunahpú turning to the maiden. "Do you, perchance, want them?" it
added.
"Yes, I want them," the maiden answered.
"Very well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the skull.

looked quickly and intently at the palm of her hand, but the spittle of the skull was not there.
"In my saliva and spittle I have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> you my descendants," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the voice in the tree.

And all that they did <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> was by <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and Raxa-Caculhá.
After all of the above talking, the maiden returned directly to her home, having immediately
conceived the <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> in her belly by virtue of the spittle only. And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
were begotten.
And so the girl returned home, and after six months had passed, her father, who was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Cuchumaquic, noticed her condition. At once the maiden's secret was discovered by her <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t8 t9 t10 t12 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t28 hoverable">father</span>
when he observed that she was pregnant.
Then the lords, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, held council with Cuchumaquic.
"My daughter is pregnant, Sirs; she has been disgraced," exclaimed Cuchumaquic when he
appeared before the lords.
"Very well," they said. "Command her to tell the truth, and if she refuses to speak, punish her;
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> her be <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> <span class="t6 t9 t18 t26 hoverable">far</span> from here and <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> her."
"Very well, Honorable Lords," he answered. Then he questioned his daughter: "Whose are the

'Very well," he replied. "You are really a whore. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">Take</span> her and <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> her, Ahpop Achih;

The four messengers <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the gourd and <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out carrying the young girl in their arms and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>

"Very well, but my <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> does not belong to them. <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> is your home here, nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span>

glistened and <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the shape of a heart. The tree gave <span class="t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t9 t10 t11 t13 t15 t17 t18 t19 t20 t22 t23 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">forth</span> sap similar to blood, with the

"Very well, girl. We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go there, we go up to serve you; you, continue on your way, while

When they arrived in the presence of the lords, all were waiting.
"You have finished?" asked Hun-Camé.
"All is finished, my lords. Here in the bottom of the gourd is the heart."
"Very well. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us see," exclaimed Hun-Camé. And grasping it with his fingers he raised it,
the shell broke and the blood flowed bright red in color.
"Stir up the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it on the coals," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hun-Camé.
As soon as they threw it on the fire, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba began to sniff and drawing near to it,
they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> the fragrance of the <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> very sweet.
And as they sat deep in thought, the owls, the maiden's servants, left, and flew <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a flock of

In this manner the Lords of Xibalba were defeated. All were tricked by the maiden.

Well, then, Hunbatz and Hunchouén were with their mother when the woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xquic

When the woman Xquic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> before the mother of Hunbatz and Hunchouén, she carried her

were to be born.
When the woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> lady, she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to her: "I have come, mother; I am your

house.
"Where did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from? Where are my sons? Did they, perchance, not die in Xibalba? Do

Hunchouén. Go from here! Get out!" the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> lady screamed at the girl.

"Nevertheless, it is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">true</span> that I am your daughter-in-law; I have been for a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time. I belong

they will return to show themselves clearly, my mother-in-law. And you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> soon <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> their

Then Hunbatz and Hunchouén became angry. They did <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> but play the flute and sing,
paint, and sculpture all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> and were the consolation of the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman.
Then the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman said: "I do not wish you to be my daughter-in-law, because what you
bear in your womb is fruit of your disgrace. Furthermore, you are an impostor; my <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> of

Presently the grandmother added: "This, that I tell you is the truth; but well, it is all right, you
are my daughter-in-law, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to what I have heard. Go, then, <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> the food for those
who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> be fed. Go and gather a large net [full of corn] and return at once, since you are my
daughter-in-law, <span class="t0 t1 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">according</span> to what I hear," she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the girl.
"Very well," the girl replied, and she <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> at once to the cornfield which Hunbatz and
Hunchouén had planted. They had opened the road and the girl <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> it and so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the
cornfield; but she <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> stalk of corn; there were not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> or three, and when she saw
that there was only <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> stalk with an ear on it, the girl became very anxious.
"Ah, sinner that I am, unfortunate me! Where <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> I go to get a net full of corn as she told me
to do?" she exclaimed. Immediately she began to beg Chahal for the food which she had to
get and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> back.
"Xtoh, Xcanil, Xcacau, you who cook the corn; and you, Chahal, guardian of the food of
Hunbatz and Hunchouén!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the girl. And then she seized the beards, the red silk of the
ears of corn and pulled them off <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> picking the ear. Then she arranged the silk in the net
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> ears of corn and the large net was completely filled.
The girl returned immediately; the animals of the field <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> along carrying the net, and when
they arrived, they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the load in a corner of the house, as <span class="t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">though</span> she <span class="t1 t2 t5 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t18 t21 t22 t23 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">might</span> have
carried it. The <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> and when she saw the corn in the large net she exclaimed:
"Where have you <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> all this corn from? Did you, perchance, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> all the corn in our field

to the cornfield. But the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> stalk of corn was still standing there, and she saw too where the
net had been at the foot of the stalk. The <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman quickly returned to her <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to
the girl:
"This is proof enough that you are really my daughter-in-law.

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 5
Now we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell of the birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. Here, then, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell about their
birth.
When the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> of their birth arrived, the girl named Xquic gave birth; but the grandmother did
not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> them when they were born. Instantly the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
were born. There in the wood they were born.
Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the house, but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not sleep.
"Go throw them out! "said the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman, "because truly they cry very much." Then they
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> them on an ant-hill. There they slept peacefully. Then they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> them from the
ant-hill and laid them on thistles.
Now, what Hunbatz and Hunchouén wished was that they [Hunahpú and Xbalanqué] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
die there on the ant-hill, or on the thistles. They wished this because of the hatred and envy
Hunbatz and Hunchouén felt for them.
At <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> they refused to receive their younger brothers in the house; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> not recognize
them and so they were <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> up in the fields.
Hunbatz and Hunchouén were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> musicians and singers; they had grown up in the midst of
trials and want and they had had <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> trouble, but they became very wise. They were
flautists, singers, painters, and carvers; all of this they knew how to do.
They had heard about their birth and knew <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> that they were the successors of their parents,
those who <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to Xibalba and died there. Hunbatz and Hunchouén were diviners, and in their
hearts they knew everything concerning the birth of their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers. Nevertheless,
because they were envious, they did not show their wisdom, and their hearts were filled with
bad will for them, although Hunahpú and Xbalanqué had not offended them in any way.
These <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> [last] did <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> but shoot their blowguns; they were not loved by
their grandmother, nor by Hunbatz, nor by Hunchouén; they were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> to eat; only
when the meal was ended and Hunbatz and Hunchouén had already eaten, then the younger
brothers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to eat. But they did not <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> angry, nor did they <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> vexed, but suffered
silently, because they knew their rank, and they understood everything clearly. They <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
their birds when they came, and Hunbatz and Hunchouén ate them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> giving anything to
either of the two, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
The only thing that Hunbatz and Hunchouén did was to play the flute and sing.
And once when Hunahpú and Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> bringing any bird at all, they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> into
the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> and their grandmother became furious.
"Why did you <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> no birds?" she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.

And they answered: "What happened, grandmother, is that our birds were caught in the tree
and we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not climb up to get them, dear grandmother. If our elder brothers so wish, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span>

"Very well," the older brothers answered, "we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go with you at dawn."
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> younger brothers then discussed the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> to overcome Hunbatz and Hunchouén.

For these reasons we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> overcome them and teach them a lesson." <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they spoke.
Then they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> toward the foot of the tree <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Canté.

"Our birds do not fall to the ground. Go and fetch them down," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to their elder
brothers.
"Very well," the latter answered. And then they climbed the tree; but the tree became larger
and the trunk swelled. Then Hunbatz and Hunchouén wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> down but they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>

Then they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the treetop. "What has happened to us, our brothers? Unfortunate we.
This tree frightens us only to look at it. Oh, our brothers!" they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> from the treetop. And
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué answered: "Loosen your breechclouts; tie them below your stomach,
leaving the <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> ends hanging and pull these from behind, and in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> you can walk

"Very well," they answered, pulling the ends of their belts back, but instantly these were
changed into tails and they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> on the appearance of monkeys. Then they hopped over the
branches of the trees, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> woods and little woods, and they buried themselves in
the forest, making faces and swinging in the branches of the trees.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> Hunbatz and Hunchouén were overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué; and only
because of their magic <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> they have done it.
Then they returned to their home, and when they arrived they spoke to their grandmother and
their mother, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> it be, grandmother, that has happened to our elder
brothers, that suddenly their faces turned into the faces of animals?" So they said.
"If you have done any harm to your elder brothers, you have hurt me and have filled me with
sadness. Do not do such a thing to your brothers, oh, my children," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman to
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
And they replied to their grandmother:

"Do not grieve, our grandmother.

it will be a difficult trial for you, grandmother. Be careful that you do not laugh at them. And
now, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us cast our lot," they said.
Immediately they began to play their flutes, playing the song of Hunahpú-Qoy. Then they
sang, playing the flute and drum, picking up their flutes and their drum. Afterward they sat
down close to their grandmother and continued playing and calling back [their brothers] with
music and song, intoning the song, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Hunahpú-Qoy.
At last, Hunbatz and Hunchouén <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> and began to dance; but when the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman saw their
ugly faces, she began to laugh, unable to control her laughter, and they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> at once and

"Now you see, grandmother! They have gone to the forest. What have you done, grandmother

again] with flute and with song, but you, try to control your laughter. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> the trial begin!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span>
Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
Immediately they began again to play. Hunbatz and Hunchouén returned dancing, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>

laughter, until finally she broke into loud laughter. They were really very amusing with their
monkey faces, their broad bottoms, their narrow tails, and the hole of their stomach. all of
which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman laugh.
Again the [elder brothers] <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> back to the woods. And Hunahpú and Xbalanqué said: "And
now what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we do, grandmother?

They played the flute again, and the monkeys returned dancing. The grandmother contained
her laughter. Then they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> up over the kitchen; their eyes gave off a red light; they drew

And as the grandmother saw all of this, she burst into violent laughter; and they did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span>

"Only once more <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we call them, grandmother, so that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> for the fourth

return the fourth time, instead they fled into the forest as quickly as they could.
The boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to their grandmother: "We have done everything possible, dear grandmother;

At once they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> their axes, their picks, and their wooden hoes and went, each carrying his

in all the large and small woods.
And having taught an animal, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xmucur, they had it climb to the top of a large tree and

"Very well," Xmucur answered.
And they began to shoot with their blowguns; certainly they did none of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of clearing
and cultivating. A little later, the dove sang, and they ran quickly, grabbing the pick and ax.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them covered his head and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> deliberately covered his hands With <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> and in

They ate at once, but they had not really done the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t7 t10 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t21 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">work</span> of

they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> home.
"We are really tired, grandmother," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arriving, stretching their legs and arms
before her, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> reason.

They returned the following day, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arriving at the field, they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> that all the trees
and vines were standing again and that the brambles and thistles had <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> entangled again.
"Who has played this trick on us;" they said. "No doubt all the small and large animals did it,
the puma, the jaguar, the deer, the rabbit, the mountain-cat, the coyote, the wild boar, the
coati, the small birds, the large birds; they, it was, who did it; in a single night, they did it."
They began again to prepare the field and to prepare the soil and cut the trees. They talked
over what they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have to do with the trees which they had cut, and the weeds which they
had pulled up.
"Now we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> watch over our cornfield; perhaps we can surprise those who <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to do all of
this damage," they said, talking it over together. And later they returned home.
"What do you think of it, grandmother? They have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> fun of us. Our field, which we had
worked, has been turned into a field of stubble and a thick woods. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> we <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it, when we
got there, a little while ago, grandmother," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to her and to their mother. "But we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span>
return there and watch over it, because it is not <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> that they do such <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> to us," they said.
Then they dressed and returned at once to their field of cut trees, and there they hid
themselves, stealthily, in the darkness.
Then all the animals gathered again; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of each kind <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> with the other small and large
animals. It was just midnight when they came, all talking as they came, <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t22 t24 t27 hoverable">saying</span> in their own
language: "Rise up, trees! Rise up, vines!"
So they spoke when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> and gathered under the trees, under the vines, and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span>
closer until they appeared before the eyes [of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué].
The puma and the jaguar were the first, and [Hunahpú and Xbalanqué] wanted to seize them,
but [the animals] did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> them. Then the deer and the rabbit <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> close. and the only parts
of them which they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> seize were their tails, only these, they pulled out. The tall of the
deer remained in their hands, and for this reason the deer and the rabbit have short tails.
<span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> the mountain-cat, the coyote, the wild boar, nor the coati fell into their hands. All the
animals passed before Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, who were furious because they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not
catch them.
But, finally, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">another</span> animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> hopping along, and this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> which was the rat, [which] they
seized instantly, and wrapped him in a cloth. Then when they had caught him, they squeezed
his head and tried to choke him, and they burned his tall in the fire, and for that reason the
rat's tail has no hair. So, too, the boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, tried to poke at his eyes.
The rat said: "I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> not die at your hands. And <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> is it your business to plant the
cornfield."
"What are you telling us now?" the boys asked the rat.
"Loosen me a little, for I have something which I wish to tell you, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> tell you
immediately, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> me something to eat," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the rat.

"We will <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> you food afterward, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> speak," they answered.
"Very well. Do you know, then, that the property of your parents Hun-Hunahpú and VucubHunahpú, as they were called, those who died in Xibalba, or rather the gear with which they
played ball, has remained and is hanging from the roof of the house: the ring, the gloves, and
the ball? Nevertheless, your grandmother does not want to show them to you for it was on
account of these <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> that your parents died."
"Are you sure of that?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the boys to the rat. And they were very happy when they heard
about the rubber ball. And as the rat had now talked, they showed the rat what his food <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>

Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the rat.
"Wonderful, boys," he said; "but what <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> I tell your grandmother if she sees me?"
"Do not worry, because we are here and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> what to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> to our grandmother. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us

We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> go quickly to the comer of the house, go at once to where the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> hang; we

rat.
And having arranged it thus, during the night after talking together, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué
arrived at midday. When they arrived, they <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the rat with them, but they did not show
it; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> directly into the house, and the other <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the corner and there <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> the
rat climb up quickly.
Immediately they asked their grandmother for food. "Prepare our food, we wish a chilisauce, grandmother," they said. And at once the food was prepared for them and a <span class="t14 hoverable">plate</span> of

But this was only to deceive their grandmother and their mother. And having dried up the

"Good," she <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> and went. Then they began to eat, but they were not really hungry; it was
only a trick.

the ball which was suspended from the roof of the house. On seeing this in their chile-sauce,
they sent to the river a <span class="t3 hoverable">certain</span> xan, an animal <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> xan which is <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a mosquito, to puncture

"What is the matter with our grandmother? Our mouths are dry, with thirst, we are dying of

which led to the ball-court.

After this they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to the river to join their grandmother and their mother, who were busily

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 7
The boys returned happily to the ball-court to play; they were playing alone a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> and
cleared the court where their parents had played.
And the Lords of Xibalba, hearing them, said: "Who are they who play again over our heads
and disturb us with the noise they make? Perchance Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did
not die, those who wished to exalt themselves before us? Go at once and call them!"
So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hun-Camé, Vucub-Camé, and all the lords. And sending the messengers to call them,

This was the command which they gave to the messengers.
And they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> then by the wide road which the boys had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> that led directly to their
house; by it the messengers arrived directly before [the boys'] grandmother. They were eating
when the messengers from Xibalba arrived.
"Tell them to come, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> fail, the lords commanded," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the messengers of Xibalba. And
the messengers of Xibalba indicated the day: "Within seven <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t11 t20 t26 t27 hoverable">days</span> they will await them," they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Xmucané.
"It is well, messengers; they will go," the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman answered. And the messengers <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t15 t17 t18 t19 hoverable">set</span> out
on their return.
Then the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> woman's <span class="t0 t1 t4 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t16 t19 t22 t23 t25 t26 hoverable">heart</span> was filled with anxiety.

grieving.
And immediately a louse fell into her lap. She seized it and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> it in the palm of her hand, and
the louse wriggled and began to walk.
"My child, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> that I sent you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">away</span> to call my grandchildren from the ball-court?"

At once the louse swaggered off. Sitting on the road was a boy <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Tamazul, or the toad.

"Very well, but I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> that you do not go quickly," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the toad to the louse.

walked a <span class="t1 t6 t21 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">long</span> time, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> hurrying.

<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">See</span> that you do not walk quickly. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Would</span> I not arrive sooner?" the snake <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the toad.
"Come here," he said. At once Zaquicaz swallowed the toad. And from then on this was the
food of snakes, who still today swallow toads.
The snake <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> quickly and having met Vac, which is a very large bird, the hawk, [the latter]
instantly swallowed the snake. Shortly afterward it arrived at the ball-court. From that time,
this has been the food of hawks, who devour snakes in the fields.
And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> arrival, the hawk perched <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> the cornice of the ball-court where Hunahpú and
Xbalanqué were amusing themselves playing ball. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Upon</span> arriving, the hawk began to cry:
"Vac-có! Vac-có!" it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> cawing. ["Here is the hawk! Here is the hawk!"]
"Who is screaming? <span class="t22 hoverable">Bring</span> our blowguns!" the boys exclaimed. And shooting at the hawk,
they aimed a pellet at the pupil of the eye and [the hawk] spiraled to the ground. They ran to
seize it and asked: "What do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to do here?" they asked the hawk.

answered.
"Very well," they said, and taking a bit of the rubber of the ball with which they were playing,

perfectly healed.
"Speak, then," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the hawk. And immediately it vomited a large snake.
"Speak, thou," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the snake.

"Where is the message that you bring?" they asked the toad.
"Herein my stomach is the message," answered the toad. And immediately he tried, but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span>
not vomit; his mouth only filled with spittle but he did not vomit. The boys wanted to hit him
then.
"You are a liar, "they said, kicking him in the rump, and the bone of the haunches gave way.
He tried again, but his mouth only filled with spittle. Then the boys opened the toad's mouth
and once open, they looked inside of it. The louse was stuck to the toad's teeth: it had stayed

in its mouth and had not been swallowed, but only pretended to be swallowed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> the toad

of the snakes.
"Speak," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the louse, and then it gave its message. "Your grandmother has said,

"Is it true?" the boys asked themselves when they heard this. And running quickly they

Then they went, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> carrying his blowgun, and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> down in the direction of Xibalba.
They descended the steps quickly and passed between several streams and ravines. They

"What has stung you, Quicrixcac?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Quicré.
In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they told their names, as they all <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> them <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> to the other. So they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span>
themselves <span class="t6 t10 t15 hoverable">known</span> by telling their names, calling each chief, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> by one. And in this manner
each of those seated in his comer told his name.
Not a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the names was missed. All told their names when Hunahpú puffed out a
hair of his leg, which was what had stung them. It was really not a mosquito which stung
them which <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> for Hunahpú and Xbalanqué to hear the names of all of them.
They [the youths] continued on their <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> and arrived where the Lords of Xibalba were.
"Greet the lord, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> who is seated,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to deceive them.
"That is not a lord. it is <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more than a wooden figure," they said, and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on.
Immediately they began to greet them:

spoke the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of all, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">without</span> missing the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of a single <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them.
But what the lords wished was that they should not discover their names.
"Sit here," they said, hoping that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> sit in the seat [which they indicated].
"That is not a seat for us; it is only a hot stone," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, and they [the
Lords of Xibalba] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> not overcome them.
"Very well, go to that house," the lords said. And they [the youths] <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on and entered the

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 9
This was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> test of Xibalba. The Lords of Xibalba <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> that [the boys'] entrance there
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be the beginning of their downfall. After a while [the boys] entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of
Gloom; immediately lighted sticks of fat pine were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> them and the messengers of HunCamé <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> a cigar to each one.
"'These are their pine sticks,' <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the lord; 'they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> return them at dawn, tomorrow, <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span>

So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the messengers
when they arrived.
"Very well," [the boys] replied. But they really did not [light] the sticks of pine, instead they
<span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> a red-colored thing in <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of them, or some feathers from the tail of the macaw, which to
the night watches looked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> lighted pine sticks. And as for the cigars, they attached fireflies
to their end.
All night [everybody] <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> they were defeated. "They are lost," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the night watchmen.
But the pine sticks had not been burned and looked the same, and the cigars had not been
lighted and looked the same as before.
They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to tell the lords.
"How is this? Whence have they come? Who conceived them? Who gave birth to them? This
really troubles us, because it is not <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> what they do. Their faces are strange, and strange is
their conduct." they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to each other.
Soon all the lords summoned [the boys].
"Eh! <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us play ball, boys!" they said. At the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> they were questioned by Hun-Camé
and Vucub-Camé:
"Where did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from?

"Who knows whence we came! We do not know," they said, and <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> more.

"Very well. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Let</span> us play ball, boys," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of Xibalba.
"Good," they replied.
"We <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> use our ball," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of Xibalba.
"By no means, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> you use [your ball], but ours," the boys answered.
"Not that one, but ours we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> use," insisted the Lords of Xibalba.
"Very well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the boys.
"Let us play for a worm, the chil," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of Xibalba.
"No, but instead, the head of the puma <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> speak," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the boys.
"Not that," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> those of Xibalba.
"Very well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Hunahpú.
Then the Lords of Xibalba seized the ball; they threw it directly at the ring of Hunahpú.
Immediately, while those of Xibalba grasped the handle of the knife of flint, the ball
rebounded and bounced all around the floor of the ball-court.
"What is this?" exclaimed Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. "You wish to kill us? Perchance you did
not send to call us? And your own messengers did not come? In truth, unfortunate are we! We
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> leave at once," the boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them.
This was exactly what those of Xibalba wanted to have happen to the boys, that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span>
die immediately, <span class="t27 hoverable">right</span> there in the ball-court and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> be overcome. But it did not
happen thus, and it was the Lords of Xibalba who were defeated by the boys.
"Do not leave, boys, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us go on playing ball, but we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> use your ball," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the
boys.
"Very well," the boys answered and then they drove their ball through [the ring of Xibalba],
and with this the game ended.
And offended by their defeat, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba immediately said: "What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we do in

And turning to the boys they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "Go gather and <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> us,

So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba to the boys.
"Very well. And what kind of flowers?" they asked the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> of Xibalba.

"Very well," replied the boys.

Thus the talk ended; equally strong and vigorous were the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">words</span> of the boys. And their hearts
were calm when they gave themselves up to be overcome.
The Lords of Xibalba were happy, thinking that they had already defeated them.
"This has turned out <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> for us. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">First</span> they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">must</span> cut them [the flowers]," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of

"Very well," they replied.

And immediately the boys entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Knives, the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> of torture in

But the [boys] did not die. They spoke at once to the knives and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them:

again, but all the knives were quiet.

"Very well," they said, and all the ants <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> the flowers from the gardens of HunCamé and Vucub-Camé.
Previously [the lords] had warned the guards of the flowers of Xibalba: "Take care of our

"Very well," they answered. But the guards of the garden heard nothing. Needlessly they
shouted up into the branches of the trees in the garden. There they were all night, repeating
their same shouts and songs.
"Ixpurpuvec! Ixpurpuvec!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> shouted.
"Puhuyú! Puhuyú!" the other answered.
Puhuyú was the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> who watched the garden of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.
But they did not notice the ants who were robbing them of what they were guarding, turning
around and moving here and there, cutting the flowers, climbing the trees to cut the flowers,
and gathering them from the ground at the foot of the trees.
Meanwhile the guards <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on crying, and they did not feel the teeth which were cutting their
tails and their wings.

And <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span> the ants carried, between their teeth, the flowers which they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> down, and
gathering them from the ground, they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> on carrying them with their teeth.
Quickly they filled the four gourds with flowers, which were moist [with dew] when it
dawned. Immediately the messengers arrived to get them. "'Tell them to come,' the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> has

"Very well," the [boys] answered. And carrying the flowers in the four gourds, they went, and
when they arrived before the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> [of Xibalba] and the other lords, it was lovely to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the
flowers they had brought. And in this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the Lords of Xibalba were overcome.
The boys had only sent the ants [to cut the flowers], and in a night the ants cut them and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span>
them in the gourds.
Instantly the Lords of Xibalba paled and their faces became livid because of the flowers. They
sent at once for the guardians of the flowers. "Why did you permit them to steal our flowers?
These which we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> here are our flowers," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the guardians.
"We noticed nothing, my lord. Our tails <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> suffered," they answered. And then the [lords]
tore at their mouths as a punishment for having <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> that which was under their care be stolen.

the beginning of their deeds. From that <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the mouth of the owl is divided, cleft as it is

Immediately they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> down to play ball, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> they played several tie-matches. Then they
finished playing and agreed to play again the following <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> at dawn. So <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of
Xibalba.
"It is well," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the boys <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">upon</span> finishing.

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 10
Afterward they entered the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Cold. It is impossible to describe how cold it was. The

That is why they did not die; they were still alive when it dawned. Surely what the Lords of
Xibalba wanted was that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> die; but it was not thus, and when it dawned, they were
still full of health, and they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> out again, when the messengers <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to get them.
"How is this? They are not dead yet?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the Lords of Xibalba.

deeds of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.
Presently the boys [entered] the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Jaguars.

"Now surely they are finished. Now already they have eaten their own entrails. At last they

Presently they [the boys] entered into the midst of <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> in the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Fire, inside which there
was only fire; but they were not burned. Only the coals and the wood burned. And, as usual,
they were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> when it dawned. But what they [the Lords of Xibalba] wished was that [the
boys] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> die rapidly, where they had been. Nevertheless, it did not happen thus, which
disheartened the Lords of Xibalba.
Then they <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> them into the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">House</span> of Bats.

They [the boys] were in there, then, but they slept inside their blowguns. And they were not
bitten by those who were in the house. Nevertheless, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of them had to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> up because of

The bats were assembled in council all night, and flew about: "Quilitz, quilitz," they said: So
they were <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 t11 t12 t15 t16 t17 t22 t24 t27 hoverable">saying</span> all night. They stopped for a little while, however, and they did not move
and were pressed against the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the blowguns.
Then Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Hunahpú: "Look you, has it begun already to get light?"
"Maybe so. I am going to see," [Hunahpú] answered.
And as he wished very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> to look out of the mouth of the blowgun, and wished to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> if it
had dawned, instantly Camazotz cut off his head and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">body</span> of Hunahpú was decapitated.
Xbalanqué asked again: "Has it not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> dawned?" But Hunahpú did not move. "Where have
you gone, Hunahpú? What have you done?" But he did not move, and remained silent.
Then Xbalanqué felt concerned and exclaimed: "Unfortunate are we. We are completely
undone."
They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> immediately to hang the head [of Hunahpú] in the ball-court by special <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> of
Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, and all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba rejoiced for what had happened to
the head of Hunahpú.

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 11
Immediately he [Xbalanqué] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> all the animals, the coati, the wild boar, all the animals
small and large, during the night, and at dawn he asked them what their food was.

"What does each of you eat?

Xbalanqué to them.
"Very well," they answered. And immediately each <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> his [own food] and they all
<span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> together. Some <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> rotten things; <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> grasses; <span class="t1 t7 t13 hoverable">others</span> <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to get

large animals.
Behind them the turtle was lingering, it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> waddling along to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> its food. And reaching at
the <span class="t7 t10 t15 t25 hoverable">end</span> [of Hunahpú's body] it assumed the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of the head of Hunahpú, and instantly the
eyes were fashioned.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> soothsayers came, then, from heaven.

It was not easy to finish making the face, but it turned out very well; the hair had a handsome
appearance and [the head] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> speak.
But as it was about to dawn and the horizon reddened: "Make it dark again, <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> one!" the
buzzard was told.
"Very well, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> one, and instantly the <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> darkened [the sky]. "Now the buzzard
has darkened it," the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">say</span> nowadays.
And so, during the cool of dawn, the [Hunahpú] began his existence.
"Will it be good?" they said. "Will it turn out to look <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> Hunahpú?"
"It is very good," they answered. And really it seemed that the skull had changed itself back
into a real head.
Then they [the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys] talked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> themselves and agreed: "Do not play ball; only
pretend to play; I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> do everything alone," <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> Xbalanqué.
At once he gave his orders to a rabbit: "Go and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> your <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> over the ball-court; stay there
<span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> the oak grove," the rabbit was told by Xbalanqué; "when the ball comes to you, run out
immediately, and I <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> do the rest," the rabbit was told, when they gave him these
instructions during the night.
Presently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> broke and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> boys were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> and healthy. Then they <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> down to play
ball. The head of Hunahpú was suspended over the ball-court.
"We have triumphed! [said the Lords of Xibalba].You worked your own destruction, you
have delivered yourselves," they said. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they annoyed Hunahpú.
"Hit his head with the ball," they said. But they did not bother him with it; he paid no
attention to it.

Then the Lords of Xibalba threw out the ball. Xbalanqué <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> out to get it; the ball was going
straight to the ring, but it stopped, bounced, and passed quickly over the ball-court and with a
jump <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> toward the oak grove.
Instantly the rabbit ran out and <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> hopping; and the Lords of Xibalba ran after it. They
went, making noise and shouting after the rabbit. It ended by all of the Lords of Xibalba
going.
At once Xbalanqué <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> possession of the head of Hunahpú; and taking the turtle he <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to
suspend it over the ball-court. And that head was actually the head of Hunahpú and the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span>
boys were very happy.
Those of Xibalba ran, then, to find the ball and having <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it between the oaks, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> them,
saying:
"Come here. Here is the ball. We <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> it," they said, and they <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> it.
When the Lords of Xibalba returned, they exclaimed, "What is this we see?"
Then they began to play again. Both of them tied.
Presently Xbalanqué threw a stone at the turtle, which <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the ground and fell in the ballcourt, breaking into a thousand pieces <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> seeds, before the lords.

Shortly afterward the messengers arrived who had to accompany [the boys], the messengers

"'Tell them to come.

"It is well," they answered. And setting out quickly, they arrived near the bonfire. There [the

"Let us drink our chicha and fly four times, each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> [over the bonfire] boys!" was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to

"Do not try to deceive us,"[the boys] answered. "Perchance, we do not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> about our death,

both stretched out their arms, bent toward the ground and jumped into the bonfire, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">thus</span>

All those of Xibalba were filled with joy, shouting and whistling they exclaimed: "Now we
have overcome them. At last they have <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> themselves up."
Immediately they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Xulú and Pacam, to whom they [the boys] had <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> their

the bones did not go very far, for settling themselves down at once on the bottom of the river,
they were changed back into handsome boys. And when again they showed themselves they
really had their same <span class="t25 hoverable">old</span> faces.

II. <span class="t12 t19 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">Chapter</span> 13
On the fifth <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">day</span> they appeared again and were seen in the <span class="t1 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">water</span> by the people. Both had the

the river.
And the following day, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> poor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> presented themselves with very old-looking faces and

So they were seen by all those of Xibalba.
And what they did was very little. They only performed the dance of the puhuy [owl or chumowl], the dance of the cux [weasel], and the dance of the iboy [armadillo], and they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span>
danced the xtzul [centipede] and the chitic [that walks on stilts].
Furthermore, they worked <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> miracles.

them in wonder.
Presently they cut themselves into bits; they killed each other; the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> whom they had

Those of Xibalba looked on in amazement at all they did, and they performed it, as the
beginning of their triumph over those of Xibalba.
Presently <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 hoverable">word</span> of their dances <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> to the ears of the lords Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.

"Surely their dances are very beautiful, and all that they do," answered he who had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>
the news to the lords.
Happy to hear this, the [lords] then sent their messengers to call [the boys] with flattery. "'Tell

told to the messengers.
They arrived at once before the dancers and gave them the message of the lords.
"We do not wish to, the [boys] answered," because, frankly, we are ashamed. How <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> we

Xbalanqué.
Finally, with downcast faces and with reluctance and sorrow they went; but for a while they
did not wish to walk, and the messengers had to beat them in the face <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> times, when they

They arrived, then, before the lords, timid and with head bowed; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> prostrating
themselves, making reverences and humiliating themselves. They looked feeble, ragged, and
their appearance was really that of vagabonds when they arrived they were questioned
immediately about their country and their people; they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> asked them about their mother and
their father.
"Where do you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> from?" [the lords] said.
"We do not know, Sir. We do not <span class="t0 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 hoverable">know</span> the faces of our mother and father; we were small

"All right.

"We do not want anything; but really we are very <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span> afraid," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the lord.
"Do not grieve, do not be afraid. Dance!

And afterwards, poor things, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> help for your journey," they told
them.
Then they began to sing and dance. All the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> of Xibalba arrived and gathered <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> in

Then they performed the dance of the cux, they danced the puhuy, and they
danced the iboy.
And the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them: "Cut my dog into pieces and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him be <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> back to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">life</span> by

"Very well," they answered, and cut the dog into bits. Instantly they <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> him back to life.
The dog was truly full of joy when he was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> back to life, and wagged his tail when they
revived him.
The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Lord</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them then: "Burn my <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">house</span> now!" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to them. instantly they <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span>

they were not burned.

Hun-Camé destroyed.
All of the lords were amazed, and in the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> the [boys'] dances gave them <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">much</span>
pleasure.
Then they were told by the lord: "Now kill a man, <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> him, but do not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> him die," he
told them.
"Very well," they answered. And seizing a man, they quickly sacrificed him, and raising his

Again Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé were amazed. A moment afterward the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span>

The lords were astounded. "Sacrifice yourselves now, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> it!

each other. Hunahpú was sacrificed by Xbalanqué; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> by <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> his arms and his legs were

and thrown onto the grass. All the Lords of Xibalba were fascinated. They looked on in
wonder, but really it was only the dance of <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> man; it was Xbalanqué.
"Get up!" he said, and instantly [Hunahpú] returned to life. They [the boys] were very happy
and the lords were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> happy. In truth, what they did gladdened the hearts of Hun-Camé and

Then their hearts were filled with desire and longing by the dances of Hunahpú and

"Do the same with us! <span class="t27 hoverable">Sacrifice</span> us!" they said. "Cut us into pieces, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> by one!" Hun-Camé

And when Hun-Camé was dead, they overpowered Vucub-Camé, and they did not <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span>

not discovered him, nor had they <span class="t0 t16 t25 t28 hoverable">found</span> him.

In truth, in those days, they did
not have the category of gods. Furthermore, their horrible faces frightened people. They were
the enemies, the owls. They incited to evil, to <span class="t26 hoverable">sin</span> and to discord.
They were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> false in their hearts, black and white at the same time, envious and tyrannical,

Furthermore, they painted and greased their faces.
In this way, then, occurred the loss of their grandeur and the decadence of their empire.
And this was what Hunahpú and Xbalanqué did.
Meanwhile, the grandmother was crying and lamenting before the reeds which they had left
planted. The reeds sprouted, then they dried up when [the boys] were consumed in the
bonfire; afterward [the reeds] sprouted again. Then the grandmother lighted the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> and

They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> saw the faces of their fathers there in Xibalba and their fathers talked with their

And here is how their fathers were honored by them. They honored Vucub-Hunahpú; they

"Ah, we have no <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> yet!

"Really? Oh, God, our support, our maintenance, thou, our God!" they said, returning thanks.
And Tohil answered: "Very well, certainly I am your God; so <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> it be! I am your Lord; so

Instantly a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> shower began to fall when the <span class="t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t10 t11 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t24 t28 t29 hoverable">fire</span> of the tribes was burning. <span class="t0 t1 t5 t10 t12 t13 t15 t19 t20 t28 hoverable">Much</span> hail fell

Then Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab again asked Tohil for fire. "Oh, Tohil, we are truly
dying of cold!" they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Tohil.
"Very well, do not worry," Tohil answered, and instantly he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> fire, turning about in his

were not <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> received. And then the tribes were very sad.
"The speech of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam is different! Oh! We

They were filled with joy then, and Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> gladdened when the

But the tribes did not perish when they came, although they were dying of cold. There was

All the tribes were trembling and shivering with cold when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> where Balam-Quitzé,

Cakchiquel did not ask for the fire, because they did not want to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> themselves up to be

about which Tohil had spoken; that they should <span class="t27 hoverable">sacrifice</span> all the tribes before him, that they
should tear out their hearts from their breasts.
And this had not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> begun when the taking of <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> and sovereignty by Balam-Quitzé,

There in Tulán-Zuivá, whence they had come, they were accustomed to fast, they observed a
perpetual fast while they awaited the coming of dawn and watched for the rising sun.
They <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> turns at watching the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> Star <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Icoquih, which rises <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> before the sun,

and subjected the large and small tribes when they sacrificed them before Tohil, and offered
him the blood, the substance, breasts, and sides of all the men.
In Tulán <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> instantly to them; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was their wisdom in the darkness and in the

Then they came, they pulled up stakes there and left the East. "This is not our home; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">let</span> us go

In truth, he was accustomed to talk to Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and IquiBalam: "Give thanks before setting out; do what is necessary to bleed your ears, prick your

"Very well, "they said, and <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> blood from their ears. And they wept in their chants because

Here, then, is the dawn, and the coming of the sun, the moon, and the stars.
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam were very happy when they saw the
Morning Star. It rose first, with shining face, when it <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> ahead of the sun.
Immediately they unwrapped the incense which they had <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> from the East, and which
they had planned to burn, and then they untied the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> gifts which they had planned to offer.
The incense which Balam-Quitzé <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Mixtán-Pom; the incense which BalamAcab <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Cavixtán-Pom; and that which Mahucutah <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> was <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span>
Cabauil-Pom. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">three</span> had their incense and burned it when they began to dance facing
toward the East.
They wept for joy as they danced and burned their incense, their precious incense. Then they
wept because they did not <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">yet</span> <span class="t0 t5 t16 t22 hoverable">behold</span> nor <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the sunrise.
But, then, the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up. The small and large animals were happy; and arose from the
banks of the river, in the ravines, and on the tops of the mountains, and all turned their eyes to
where the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> was rising.
Then the puma and the jaguar roared. But <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> the bird <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">called</span> Queletzú burst into song. In
truth, all the animals were happy, and the eagle, the white vulture; the small birds and the
large birds stretched their wings.
The Priests and the sacrificers were kneeling; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> was the joy of the priests and sacrificers

Tziquinahá, and those from Tuhalhá, Uchabahá, Quibahá, from Batená, and the Yaqui Tepeu,

Instantly the surface of the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">earth</span> was dried by the sun. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Like</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">man</span> was the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> when it
showed itself, and its face glowed when it dried the surface of the earth.
Before the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> rose, damp and muddy was the surface of the earth, before the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up;

when it was born and remained fixed [in the sky] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a mirror. Certainly it was not the same

Immediately afterward Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were turned to stone, <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> with the
deified beings the puma, the jaguar, the snake, the cantil, and the hobgoblin. Their arms
became fastened to the trees when the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared. All alike, were
changed into stone. Perhaps we should not be living today because of the voracious animals,
the puma, the jaguar, the snake, and the cantil, as <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> as the hobgoblin; perhaps our <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span>

When the <span class="t0 t8 t11 t14 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">sun</span> arose, the hearts of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam
were filled with joy. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Great</span> was their joy when it dawned.

they burned their incense and danced, turning their gaze toward the East, whence they had
come. There were their mountains and their valleys, whence had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> Balam-Quitzé, BalamAcab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, as they were called.
But it was here where they multiplied, on the mountain, and this was their town; here they
were, too, when the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared, when it dawned and the face of the

Here, too, began their song, which they call camucú;
they sang it, but only the pain in their hearts and their innermost selves they expressed in their
song. "Oh pity us! In Tulán we were lost, we were separated, and there our older and younger
brothers stayed. Ah, we have seen the sun! but where are they now, that it has dawned?" so
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> the priests and the sacrificers of the Yaqui.

When they arrived, the lords were filled with joy to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> their faces and their hands, from
which hung the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">things</span> the maidens had gone for.
"Did you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">see</span> the face of Tohil?" they asked them.
"Yes, we saw it," answered Xtah and Xpuch.
"Very well. And you <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> the token, do you not?" the lords asked, thinking that this was the
proof of their sin.
Then the maidens held out the painted capes, all covered with [the figures] of jaguars and
eagles, and covered with bumblebees and wasps, painted on the surface of the cloth and which
shone before them. At once they felt a desire to <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> the capes on.
The jaguar did <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> when the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> threw the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> painting on his back. Then the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on
the <span class="t6 hoverable">second</span> painting, with the figure of the eagle. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">lord</span> felt very <span class="t1 t2 t4 t6 t8 t10 t12 t13 t14 t17 t19 t23 t25 t28 hoverable">well</span> wrapped <span class="t5 t7 hoverable">within</span> it.
And he turned about before all of them.
Then he undressed before all, and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on the third painted cape. And now he had on himself,
the bumblebees and wasps which were on it. Instantly the bumblebees and the wasps stung his
flesh. And not being able to suffer the stings of these insects, he began to scream because of
the insects <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t18 t19 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 hoverable">whose</span> figures were painted on the cloth, the painting of Mahucutah, which was the
third <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> that had been painted.
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Thus</span> they were overcome. Then the lords reprimanded the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> maidens named Xtah and
Xpuch: "What kind of clothes are those which you have brought? Where did you go to <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span>
them, you devils?" they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to the maidens when they reprimanded them. All the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> were
overcome by Tohil.
Well, what they [the lords] wanted was that Tohil should have gone to amuse himself with
Xtah and Xpuch, and that the [maidens] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> have <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> whores, for the tribes believed
that they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">would</span> serve to tempt them. But it was not possible that they should overcome them,
thanks to those miraculous men, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.

Afterwards the tribes held council again.
"What <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> we do with them? in truth, their estate is very great," they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> when they

And all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> armed. <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Many</span> were the
warriors when all the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> gathered <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> for the killing.

Meanwhile, there were Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, they were
on the mountain Hacavitz, on the hill of this name. They were there in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to save their <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span>
who were on the mountain.
And they did not have <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> people, they did not have multitudes such as the multitudes of
the tribes. The summit of the mountain where they had their <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> was small, and for that
reason when the tribes assembled <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> and rose, they decided to kill all of them.
In this manner, then, <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> the reunion of all the people, all armed with their bows and
their shields. It is impossible to describe the richness of their arms; the appearance of all the
chiefs and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">men</span> was very beautiful, and certainly all obeyed their orders.
"They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> positively be destroyed, and as for Tohil. he <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> be our god, we <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> worship

But Tohil knew everything and so did
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah. They heard all the plans, because they did not
sleep, or rest, from the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> the warriors armed themselves.
Then all the warriors rose up and started out on the road, intending to enter [the town] by
night. But they did not arrive, for all the warriors were watching on the road, and then they
were destroyed by Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah.
All remained watching along the road, but they heard <span class="t15 t25 t26 t29 hoverable">nothing</span> and they finally fell asleep.
Then they [Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah] began to pull out their eyelashes and
their beards; they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> off the metal ornaments from their throats--their crowns and necklaces.
And they <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> the metal from the handles of their spears. They did this to punish them and
humiliate them, and <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">give</span> them an example of the <span class="t0 t2 t3 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">power</span> of the Quiché people.
When they [the warriors] awoke, they wanted to <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">take</span> their crowns and their staffs, but they no
longer had metal in the staff-handles, nor their crowns. "Who has stripped us? Who has torn
out our beards? Whence have they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">come</span> to rob us of our precious metals?" <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> all of the
warriors. "Can it be these devils who are carrying off the men? But they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> not succeed in

Meanwhile the hearts of the priests and the sacrificers on the summit of the mountain were
calm. And Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam having talked together,
they built a wall at the edge of the town and enclosed it with boards and thorns. Then they
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> figures in the <span class="t6 t7 t8 t9 t13 t14 t16 t17 t19 t20 t21 t28 t29 hoverable">form</span> of men, and <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> them in rows on the wall, armed them with shields
and arrows and adorned them, putting metal crowns on their heads. These they <span class="t0 t2 t16 t18 t21 t22 t23 hoverable">put</span> on the
simple wooden figures, they adorned them with the metal which they had <span class="t19 hoverable">taken</span> from the
tribes on the road and with them they decorated the figures.
They <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">made</span> a moat around the town, and then they asked advice of Tohil: "Shall they kill us?
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">Shall</span> they overcome us?" their hearts <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to Tohil.
"Do not be troubled! I am here. And this you will use. Do not be afraid," he [Tohil] <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, when they were <span class="t1 t2 t4 t7 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">given</span> the

them inside four big gourds which were placed around the town. They shut the bumblebees
and wasps inside the gourds, in <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> to fight the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> with them.

"They
are not many," they said. But they saw only the wooden figures which lightly moved their
bows and their shields. In truth, they had the appearance of men, had in <span class="t3 t7 t9 t10 t15 t19 t22 hoverable">truth</span> the appearance
of warriors when the tribes looked at them, and all the tribes were happy because they saw
that they were not many.
There were <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> tribes; it was not possible to count the people, the warriors and soldiers who
were going to kill Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah, who were on the mountain
Hacavitz, the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">name</span> of the <span class="t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">place</span> where they were found.

came. The tribes did not number sixteen thousand, or twenty-four thousand men, [but <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">even</span>

They surrounded the town, crying out loudly, armed with arrows and shields, beating drums,
giving war whoops, whistling, shouting, inciting them to fight, when they arrived in front of
the town.
But the priests and sacrificers were not frightened; they only looked at them from the edge of
the wall, where they were in <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">good</span> <span class="t0 t6 t7 t8 t11 t13 t14 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t24 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">order</span> with their wives and children. They <span class="t0 t5 t6 t14 t18 hoverable">thought</span> only of
the strength and the shouting of the tribes when they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> up the side of the mountain.
Shortly before they were about to throw themselves at the entrance of the town, the four
gourds which were at the edge of the town were opened and the bumblebees and the wasps
<span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">came</span> out of the gourds; <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">like</span> a <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">great</span> cloud of smoke they emerged from the gourds.

the warriors perished because of the insects which stung the pupils of their eyes and fastened
themselves to their noses, their mouths, their legs, and their arms. "Where are they," they said,
"those who <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> to get and <span class="t22 hoverable">bring</span> in all the bumblebees and wasps that are here?"
They <span class="t0 t3 t4 t5 t8 t10 t11 t16 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t26 t27 t29 hoverable">went</span> straight to sting the pupils of their eyes, the little insects buzzing in swarms over
each <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">one</span> of the men; and the latter, stunned by the bumblebees and wasps, <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t16 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t28 t29 hoverable">could</span> no longer
grasp their bows and their shields, which were broken on the ground.
When the warriors fell, they were stretched out on the mountainside, and they no longer felt
when they were hit with arrows, and wounded by the axes. Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab
<span class="t27 hoverable">used</span> only blunt sticks. Their wives <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">also</span> <span class="t4 hoverable">took</span> <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t17 t18 t20 t21 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">part</span> in this killing.

attacked by the insects. <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">Neither</span> was it a deed of valor, because the warriors were not killed by
arrows or by shields.
Then all the tribes surrendered. The <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">people</span> humbled themselves before Balam-Quitzé, BalamAcab, and Mahucutah. "Have pity on us, do not kill us," they exclaimed.

"Very well. Although you deserve to die, you <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">shall</span> [instead] <span class="t8 t13 hoverable">become</span> [our] vassals for the rest

there on the mountain Hacavitz, as it is now called. This was where they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> settled, where
they multiplied and increased, begot their daughters, gave being to their sons, on the mountain
Hacavitz.
They were, then, very happy when they had overcome all the tribes, whom they destroyed
there on the mountaintop. In this <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">way</span> they carried out the destruction of the tribes, of all the
tribes. After this their hearts rested. And they <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">said</span> to their <span class="t0 t3 t4 t24 hoverable">sons</span> that when they [the tribes]

And as they had had a presentiment of their death, they counseled their children. They were
not ill, they had <span class="t4 t18 t22 hoverable">neither</span> pain nor agony when they gave their advice to their children.
These are the names of their sons: Balam-Quitzé had <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">two</span> sons, Qocaib the <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">first</span> was called,

So, then, they bade [their sons] farewell. The four were <span class="t16 t21 hoverable">together</span> and they began to sing,
feeling sad in their hearts; and their hearts wept when they sang the camucú, as the song is

Those who had gone to the East to receive the sovereignty were now dead. They were already

Finally Qocaib returned and gave an account of his mission. "He <span class="t2 t4 t5 t22 t23 hoverable">brought</span> the titles of Ahpop,

had come.

Qocaib accepted the explanation, and taking the child's cradle said: "'From today on, and

And Conaché and Beleheb-Queh, the Galel-Ahau, ruled. Then <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">king</span> Cotuhá and Iztayul

There, then, they built <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">many</span> houses and at the same <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">time</span> constructed the temple of God; in

up amongst them over the price for their sisters and their daughters, and because they no
longer drank together.
This, then, was the reason why they divided and why they turned against each other, and they
threw the skulls of the dead, they hurled them around <span class="t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 t10 t11 t12 t13 t14 t15 t16 t17 t18 t19 t20 t21 t22 t23 t24 t25 t26 t27 t28 t29 hoverable">among</span> each other.
